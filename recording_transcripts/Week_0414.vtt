<v Hou, Eric>Going through.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/88-0

<v Hou, Eric>So then for for for AI, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/116-0
00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is something that we're
interested in.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/116-1
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.712
<v Hou, Eric>And then Fei will be focusing on AI for
drug discovery and startups.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/127-0

<v Fei Li>Thank you, Eric.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/148-0

<v Fei Li>Good evening everyone.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/164-0

<v Fei Li>So first of all,
it's really my great pleasure to be here</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/164-1

<v Fei Li>at Marquette University classroom.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/181-0
00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:17.229
<v Fei Li>Virtually, I want to thank you,
Professor Eric again,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/181-1

<v Fei Li>for the kind invitation.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/207-0
00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:25.364
<v Fei Li>I'm fairly currently work as a University
of Chicago Center for Entrepreneurship</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/207-1
00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:29.271
<v Fei Li>and Innovation.
Post Center is the commercialization</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/207-2
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:32.072
<v Fei Li>engine that advances innovative ideas.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/214-0
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:34.672
<v Fei Li>And technologies from the University of
Chicago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/221-0
00:01:35.102 --> 00:01:37.222
<v Fei Li>Ecosystems to the world.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/262-0
00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:42.973
<v Fei Li>So we have incubated a few hospit brand
name companies such as Grubhub and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/262-1
00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:48.693
<v Fei Li>Braintree, which was part of the PayPal.
As a typical presentations of our poster</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/262-2
00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:54.342
<v Fei Li>child companies that we are very proud of
that we incubated here in new Chicago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/278-0
00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:59.888
<v Fei Li>So today I want to share some insights on
AI for drug discovery and startups that</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/278-1
00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:02.182
<v Fei Li>we are supporting here at U Chicago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/282-0
00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:05.282
<v Fei Li>Can you hear me clearly?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/284-0
00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:07.072
<v Fei Li>OK.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/323-0
00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:16.298
<v Fei Li>So as a local who lives in Milwaukee,
I also have to explain how I work for you.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/323-1
00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:19.809
<v Fei Li>Chicago.
The university still operates in a hybrid</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/323-2
00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:23.044
<v Fei Li>mode,
so I go to Chicago one day or two days a</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/323-3
00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.522
<v Fei Li>week, either by train or by driving.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/356-0
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:30.682
<v Fei Li>So my talk today here comes in those
three parts and the first part is about</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/356-1
00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:35.869
<v Fei Li>what positives and what I do hoping to
unlock some resources for those of you</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/356-2
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.792
<v Fei Li>who are thinking about a student
entrepreneurship because.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/367-0
00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:43.702
<v Fei Li>Those other resources could be helpful
for you for you down the road.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/406-0
00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:49.034
<v Fei Li>Then I will quickly go through the
current private market investing trends</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/406-1
00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:52.824
<v Fei Li>and dynamics. As Eric explained,
it could be very interesting during this</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/406-2
00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:56.716
<v Fei Li>turbulent times and the last part where I
will shed some light on AI can do</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/406-3
00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.072
<v Fei Li>interrupt discoveries because that's kind
of.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/420-0
00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:03.783
<v Fei Li>People think about AI,
what they can do to transform another</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/420-1
00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.982
<v Fei Li>industry, and it's happening right now.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/433-0
00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:12.492
<v Fei Li>Originally originally established as
Chicago Bulls in 1998.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/463-0
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:17.558
<v Fei Li>The Pals Center has provided over two
decades of venture support for students</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/463-1
00:03:17.558 --> 00:03:22.362
<v Fei Li>who are interested in entrepreneurship
and robust training for students that</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/463-2
00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:26.292
<v Fei Li>want to pursue a career in venture
capital and private equity.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/480-0
00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:33.535
<v Fei Li>So the namesake prosky is a generous gift
from university trustee and Chicago Booth</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/480-1
00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:34.892
<v Fei Li>alum Mike Poste.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/482-0
00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:36.052
<v Fei Li>Who got his MBA?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/486-0
00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:37.632
<v Fei Li>In 1987.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/493-0
00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:39.382
<v Fei Li>From the University of Chicago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/532-0
00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:44.782
<v Fei Li>And he decided to donate the middle
fortune by his own efforts,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/532-1
00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:51.053
<v Fei Li>try to endow a certain polar amount to
make the namesake submission to expand.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/532-2
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:57.323
<v Fei Li>Include additional focus on supporting
all the university faculty inventors in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/532-3
00:03:57.323 --> 00:04:00.022
<v Fei Li>commercializing their discoveries.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/540-0
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:03.222
<v Fei Li>That's part of my job to help support the
faculty members as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/549-0
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.072
<v Fei Li>So today the Polsky Center is a 60% team.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/599-0
00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:13.302
<v Fei Li>That supports 3 or 4 aspects of what we
do here like entrepreneurship, education,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/599-1
00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:18.392
<v Fei Li>venture support and funding, technology,
commercialization and licensing,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/599-2
00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:22.726
<v Fei Li>and the corporate partnerships and the
industry relationships.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/599-3
00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:27.403
<v Fei Li>Because with the university,
our main focus and mission is to train</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/599-4
00:04:27.403 --> 00:04:30.842
<v Fei Li>the next generation of entrepreneurs by
doing it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/605-0
00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:33.022
<v Fei Li>Alone, we cannot be successful,
so we have to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/609-0
00:04:34.072 --> 00:04:35.592
<v Fei Li>Rely on other resources.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/612-0
00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:37.472
<v Fei Li>To make it happen.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/622-0
00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:43.712
<v Fei Li>Way to come to innovation and investing.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/674-0
00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:50.262
<v Fei Li>We provide both technologies and funding
on the science and technology innovations.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/702-0
00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:55.444
<v Fei Li>We are supporting sponsored research and
IP protection and business licensing</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/702-1
00:04:55.444 --> 00:04:59.735
<v Fei Li>where we fund you know,
first protect the the research bodies the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/702-2
00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:03.766
<v Fei Li>professor discovered on campus,
then find a partner who wants</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/702-3
00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:08.772
<v Fei Li>commercialized that technology and take
to the next step to the marketplace.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/710-0
00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:13.907
<v Fei Li>So that's where the technology
commercialization is all about here shows</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/710-1
00:05:13.907 --> 00:05:14.572
<v Fei Li>the stats.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/717-0
00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.422
<v Fei Li>Of our licensing data.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/723-0
00:05:16.422 --> 00:05:19.422
<v Fei Li>The data here is based on year 23.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/726-0
00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:20.422
<v Fei Li>It's a little bit outdated.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/745-0
00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:26.346
<v Fei Li>That the year we brought back $19 million

00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:09.223
<v Fei Li>So there are certain IP licenses within
university and the industry partners and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/832-1

<v Hou, Eric>University of Chicago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1034-0
00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:28.085
<v Fei Li>These acquisitions, you know,
do not have to be you Chicago operations</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1034-1
00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:33.382
<v Fei Li>and accept applications in cleantech,
which is the resurgence data science in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1034-2
00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:36.575
<v Fei Li>the AI,
which is the transform and the duality</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1034-3
00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:40.582
<v Fei Li>which is the quantum accelerator,
the first of the nation.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1041-0
00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:44.502
<v Fei Li>So that's the area. As Eric mentioned,
you can explore if you are interested.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1051-0

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:59.310
<v Fei Li>That supports transformative business
ideas that could become the categorical</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1081-1

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:03.582
<v Fei Li>So last year.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1089-0
00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:06.542
<v Fei Li>The price.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1107-0
00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:11.881
<v Fei Li>The price and pool gets bigger and the
1st place winners in the past two years</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1107-1

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.716
<v Fei Li>So that means when you finish the
competition,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1126-1
00:08:17.716 --> 00:08:21.504
<v Fei Li>you know you already have one over $1

00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:30.301
<v Fei Li>But the criteria for that is you have to
be you Chicago and one participant member</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1145-1
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.712
<v Fei Li>has to be a boost.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1149-0
00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.312
<v Fei Li>MBA students in order to be eligible.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1173-0
00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:39.761
<v Fei Li>The university endowments,
which is a $10 billion enterprise,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1173-1
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:43.172
<v Fei Li>also directly investing you you Chicago
startups.</v>

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:46.901
<v Fei Li>But that will come at a later stage like
Feed or Series A.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1188-1
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:50.692
<v Fei Li>Once the startups are in better shape or
further DE risked.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1234-0
00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:58.099

00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:48.922
<v Fei Li>Have an idea?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1448-0
00:10:48.922 --> 00:10:53.120
<v Fei Li>They come to the professors,
come to us to see with how we support</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1448-1
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.940
<v Fei Li>them,
so we provide them with some staff and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1448-2
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.882
<v Fei Li>money to get that kick started.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1450-0
00:10:59.642 --> 00:10:59.722
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1470-0
00:11:01.852 --> 00:11:07.899
<v Fei Li>And moving along the stages towards later
stage you see the start number of</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1470-1
00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:09.252
<v Fei Li>startups similar.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1494-0
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:14.489
<v Fei Li>That's also the the nature of which are
investing the game of how the game is</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1494-1
00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:17.711
<v Fei Li>played,
because during each stage some startups</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1494-2
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:18.852
<v Fei Li>may not work out.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1515-0
00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:23.399
<v Fei Li>So there will be no further funding and
some turns out to be further the risk</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1515-1
00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:26.372
<v Fei Li>along the pipeline make investors more
interested.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1517-0
00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:27.172
<v Fei Li>So that's how.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1532-0
00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:32.451
<v Fei Li>We think about investing.
So for the most of the $300 million</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1532-1
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:32.962
<v Fei Li>raised.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1547-0
00:11:33.432 --> 00:11:39.111
<v Fei Li>Is posted by two stars.
Lines of peaks on quality,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1547-1
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:41.672
<v Fei Li>which on Ipo's in 2021.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1570-0
00:11:42.432 --> 00:11:51.138
<v Fei Li>The other one is AI for protein design
company raise a 54 mill in 2023 that was</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1570-1
00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:54.512
<v Fei Li>backed by NVIDIA and Microsoft.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1602-0
00:11:56.002 --> 00:12:00.479
<v Fei Li>As not have a traditional sense of
engineering school like unlike</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1602-1
00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:05.499
<v Fei Li>Marquette's so most of us are from
medical school Cancer Research center,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1602-2
00:12:05.499 --> 00:12:09.162
<v Fei Li>Monica engineering, chemistry departments,
et cetera.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1606-0
00:12:09.202 --> 00:12:11.602
<v Fei Li>So in addition to life,
science and biotech.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1646-0
00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:17.009
<v Fei Li>We have a few startups in the AI and
quantum space like the meta microscope,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1646-1
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:21.378
<v Fei Li>which I will explain later about what we
do here and then the MQ,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1646-2
00:12:21.378 --> 00:12:26.674
<v Fei Li>which is a quantum computing company that
provides a different alternative that</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1646-3
00:12:26.674 --> 00:12:30.712
<v Fei Li>could serve the challenges in traditional
quantum computing.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1662-0
00:12:33.662 --> 00:12:38.222
<v Fei Li>One example I want to share with you is a
company called Net microscope.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1675-0
00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:42.542
<v Fei Li>So you can see it's just too much.
Too many company at this moment.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1676-0
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:44.022
<v Fei Li>Maybe they grow.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1705-0
00:12:44.022 --> 00:12:50.629
<v Fei Li>They hired a few folks and recently it
was founded by two computer science</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1705-1
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:55.298
<v Fei Li>professors, Nick Framser,
who works in at U Chicago,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1705-2
00:12:55.298 --> 00:12:59.262
<v Fei Li>and Francesco Brunzino,
who works in France.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1709-0
00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:00.922
<v Fei Li>French university.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1719-0
00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:05.042
<v Fei Li>They work together to create this idea
about intelligent network operations.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1759-0
00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:10.867
<v Fei Li>How they want to network and border both
are experts in these fields,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1759-1
00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:16.599
<v Fei Li>so you may wonder why networking network
monitoring is important when you watch</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1759-2
00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:20.755
<v Fei Li>YouTube or Netflix,
you have to be frictionless streaming</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1759-3
00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:23.692
<v Fei Li>experience to make you experience platin.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1770-0
00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:27.415
<v Fei Li>Otherwise,
if there's a glitch here and there,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1770-1
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:29.452
<v Fei Li>make your experience very.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1785-0
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.811
<v Fei Li>Uncomfortable.
So that's why it's important to know how</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1785-1
00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:36.562
<v Fei Li>your network provider performs on a high
level.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1795-0
00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:39.602
<v Fei Li>And for different users,
what's the problem?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1796-0
00:13:39.842 --> 00:13:40.722
<v Fei Li>The problem?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1828-0
00:13:40.762 --> 00:13:45.363
<v Fei Li>Nick was trying to solve is that when
users face network disruptions,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1828-1
00:13:45.363 --> 00:13:50.357
<v Fei Li>network operators have lost data,
lack of action insights when they look at</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1828-2
00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:54.695
<v Fei Li>the data comes to them.
Let's say what they want to do to improve</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1828-3
00:13:54.695 --> 00:13:59.492
<v Fei Li>the experience or operation experience,
user experience. So Nick and Fr.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1835-0
00:13:59.802 --> 00:14:02.842
<v Fei Li>Believe that the actionable insights
could be valuable.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1841-0
00:14:03.602 --> 00:14:05.962
<v Fei Li>Which could receive time and money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1843-0
00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:06.722
<v Fei Li>That's two factors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1863-0
00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:12.605
<v Fei Li>We care more in most of the case they
target that the one become the open eye</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1863-1
00:14:12.605 --> 00:14:13.872
<v Fei Li>of for networking.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1872-0
00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:17.152
<v Fei Li>So they found in that microscope about
two years ago.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1887-0
00:14:17.152 --> 00:14:20.666
<v Fei Li>So it's very early.
The technology is still risks through</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1887-1
00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:23.392
<v Fei Li>initial customer deployment and
deployments.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1907-0
00:14:23.432 --> 00:14:27.971
<v Fei Li>This is also an important concepts when
you have idea you want to have real</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1907-1
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:32.152
<v Fei Li>customers who want to pay you to buy your
product or service so that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1914-0
00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:34.802
<v Fei Li>Will give the investors some confidence.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1917-0
00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:36.402
<v Fei Li>Why this will be important.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1924-0
00:14:41.252 --> 00:14:45.972
<v Fei Li>So then my job here is you make.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1926-0
00:14:48.362 --> 00:14:48.722
<v Fei Li>Them.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1943-0
00:14:50.112 --> 00:14:54.845
<v Fei Li>Understand how cyber work because
professors working on university,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1943-1
00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:57.072
<v Fei Li>their main focus is on research.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1944-0
00:14:57.112 --> 00:14:58.632
<v Fei Li>We deal with commercialization.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1946-0
00:14:58.632 --> 00:14:59.232
<v Fei Li>They have to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1982-0
00:15:00.722 --> 00:15:05.610
<v Fei Li>Rely on us on to provide more guidance
and when they come to startup raising</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1982-1
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.038
<v Fei Li>money you need to show investors what
your plans are.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1982-2
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:12.402
<v Fei Li>If you get the money and how you're going
to use it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1995-0
00:15:12.922 --> 00:15:18.665
<v Fei Li>Here is how it looks like,
like like a timeline for the next 12 to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/1995-1
00:15:18.665 --> 00:15:19.522
<v Fei Li>18 months.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2010-0
00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:24.112
<v Fei Li>Sometimes 24 to 36 months on cash burn
situation.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2039-0
00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:28.324
<v Fei Li>You have to be specific in this case,
not a microscope.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2039-1
00:15:28.324 --> 00:15:33.613
<v Fei Li>Has Comcast as their first paying
customer and use Chicago as the free</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2039-2
00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:36.592
<v Fei Li>trial customer to validate the products?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2057-0
00:15:36.632 --> 00:15:39.299
<v Fei Li>Of course,
university is not going to pay if they</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2057-1
00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.752
<v Fei Li>know Nick developed a product here on
campus.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2061-0
00:15:41.752 --> 00:15:44.392
<v Fei Li>They have the privilege and access to use
it first.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2063-0
00:15:46.442 --> 00:15:46.562
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2072-0
00:15:46.882 --> 00:15:50.122
<v Fei Li>When I work with them,
I hope them connect to investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2113-0
00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:55.786
<v Fei Li>AI and it space ID infrastructure space I
also called unique on how to talk to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2113-1
00:15:55.786 --> 00:16:00.490
<v Fei Li>investors because that's gonna be
important skill as as well and hope them</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2113-2
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.632
<v Fei Li>build the business plan especially about
when the investors write their check and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2113-3
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.952
<v Fei Li>put their belief in you and how will.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2129-0
00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Fei Li>They expect like 100, one,
100K become a $1 million or $10 million.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2129-1
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.152
<v Fei Li>That's kind of the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2143-0
00:16:15.882 --> 00:16:19.642
<v Fei Li>The skills or the idea you have to think
about beforehand, talk to investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2181-0
00:16:20.632 --> 00:16:23.931
<v Fei Li>So this is part of my daily job at
Postgis Center.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2181-1
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:29.107
<v Fei Li>So for the next few slides I'm going to
switch to the second part of my talk on</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2181-2
00:16:29.107 --> 00:16:33.182
<v Fei Li>current market trends.
Why market trends are important because</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2181-3
00:16:33.182 --> 00:16:37.322
<v Fei Li>like every business,
when you kind of startup is also a supply.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2197-0
00:16:37.322 --> 00:16:41.739
<v Fei Li>And demand game the difference that is on
the two sides of supply,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2197-1
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:45.232
<v Fei Li>demand money and startups.
The investors have money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2201-0
00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:46.602
<v Fei Li>Looking startups to invest.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2204-0
00:16:48.362 --> 00:16:49.202
<v Fei Li>And the startups.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2214-0
00:16:49.672 --> 00:16:51.724
<v Fei Li>You know,
has the technology has the potential,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2214-1
00:16:51.724 --> 00:16:52.792
<v Fei Li>but they don't the money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2220-0
00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:55.232
<v Fei Li>So you have to find a find a match.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2249-0
00:16:55.352 --> 00:16:59.162
<v Fei Li>So there is a situation where too much
money takes too few deals,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2249-1
00:16:59.162 --> 00:17:01.702
<v Fei Li>making the evaluation of stocks hyper
high.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2249-2
00:17:01.702 --> 00:17:04.472
<v Fei Li>So that could be a problem for several
aspects.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2252-0
00:17:04.472 --> 00:17:06.232
<v Fei Li>So that's something to bear in mind.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2255-0
00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:07.912
<v Fei Li>I will explain to you later.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2260-0
00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.132
<v Fei Li>And just a a teaser here.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2265-0
00:17:11.132 --> 00:17:12.772
<v Fei Li>Does anyone know what this curve?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2271-0
00:17:14.562 --> 00:17:16.602
<v Fei Li>What this curve is and anyone?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2277-0
00:17:21.392 --> 00:17:23.912
<v Fei Li>321 nobody.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2278-0
00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:25.382
<v Mertens, Aidric>Fed funds rate.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2281-0
00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:27.712
<v Fei Li>Say it again.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2282-0
00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:27.402
<v Mertens, Aidric>I don't know.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2294-0
00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:31.488
<v Mertens, Aidric>No,
I was just guessing the Fed fed funds</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2294-1
00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:32.762
<v Mertens, Aidric>rate, but probably not.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2298-0
00:17:32.582 --> 00:17:33.582
<v Fei Li>Actually that is.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2306-0
00:17:33.622 --> 00:17:37.382
<v Fei Li>So give your name to Eric or some bonus
points.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2307-0
00:17:38.102 --> 00:17:39.422
<v Fei Li>Yes, exactly.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2309-0
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:40.542
<v Fei Li>So that's the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2336-0
00:17:42.002 --> 00:17:47.861
<v Fei Li>That's the Fed fund rates the, you know,
in a plain instance is an interest rate</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2336-1
00:17:47.861 --> 00:17:53.431
<v Fei Li>curve more precisely like you mentioned,
is the effective federal funds rate</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2336-2
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:55.962
<v Fei Li>ranging from 2008 to November 2024.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2343-0
00:17:56.002 --> 00:17:59.842
<v Fei Li>So you updated right now.
I think it's even even higher.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2347-0
00:18:01.482 --> 00:18:02.122
<v Fei Li>The first week.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2352-0
00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:06.232
<v Fei Li>Is before pandemic, right? And the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2355-0
00:18:08.482 --> 00:18:09.082
<v Fei Li>And the second.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2387-0
00:18:12.912 --> 00:18:18.680
<v Fei Li>2020 the Fed dropped the interest rate
because of COVID to stimulate economy and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2387-1
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.593
<v Fei Li>for the Internet near at the bottom,
close to 0 for two years before</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2387-2
00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:26.512
<v Fei Li>tightening up and raising interest rates.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2392-0
00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.192
<v Fei Li>So why the Fed has to do that?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2408-0
00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:33.683
<v Fei Li>And why the Fed did that?
And how does that importance of private</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2408-1
00:18:33.683 --> 00:18:37.097
<v Fei Li>investing market?
So that's will be reflected in the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2408-2
00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:38.192
<v Fei Li>following slides.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2423-0
00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:46.131
<v Fei Li>When the interest rate is low,
the cost of borrowing is according very</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2423-1
00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:46.442
<v Fei Li>low.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2434-0
00:18:46.482 --> 00:18:49.962
<v Fei Li>So that's why you see a Pike in Spike in
both deals.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2456-0
00:18:51.482 --> 00:18:56.264
<v Fei Li>In terms of numbers and the deal counts
like the dollar amounts,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2456-1
00:18:56.264 --> 00:18:59.722
<v Fei Li>a greater dollar amount invested here in
2021.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2474-0
00:19:01.362 --> 00:19:07.157
<v Fei Li>Is over across the $80 billion mark each
each of the respective 4 quarters and the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2474-1
00:19:07.157 --> 00:19:09.042
<v Fei Li>deal counts also skyrocket.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2476-0
00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:10.242
<v Fei Li>You know, some in some.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2487-0
00:19:10.552 --> 00:19:13.512
<v Fei Li>Degree close to 5000 in certain quarters.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2492-0
00:19:13.712 --> 00:19:14.872
<v Fei Li>So that's gonna be insane.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2497-0
00:19:15.512 --> 00:19:17.832
<v Fei Li>Over $80 billion we invested in.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2503-0
00:19:19.322 --> 00:19:20.602
<v Fei Li>December 2021 alone.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2511-0
00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:24.472
<v Fei Li>So after the Fed started to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2516-0
00:19:25.792 --> 00:19:27.592
<v Fei Li>Quantum hyphen.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2527-0
00:19:27.712 --> 00:19:32.592
<v Fei Li>So the number of deals and your values
began to drop significantly because.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2542-0
00:19:34.202 --> 00:19:37.384
<v Fei Li>The cost of borrowing money began to
increase,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2542-1
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:40.362
<v Fei Li>so that will play some burden here as
well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2584-0
00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:50.709
<v Fei Li>This graph further explains on the other
side of the vitre capital,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2584-1
00:19:50.709 --> 00:19:57.593
<v Fei Li>where during the easy Money Times fund
managers raise a record high which</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2584-2
00:19:57.593 --> 00:20:04.292
<v Fei Li>capital in 2021 and 22 each year
respectively over one $60 billion were</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2584-3
00:20:04.292 --> 00:20:05.222
<v Fei Li>raised by.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2591-0
00:20:06.722 --> 00:20:08.322
<v Fei Li>1500 funds.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2595-0
00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:10.162
<v Fei Li>So that's from the funds side.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2604-0
00:20:10.722 --> 00:20:14.953
<v Fei Li>So in addition,
more funds were created in two years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2604-1
00:20:14.953 --> 00:20:16.442
<v Fei Li>In those two years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2636-0
00:20:18.002 --> 00:20:23.054
<v Fei Li>Compared with the rest of the year,
at least a year, and in 2023 and 2024,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2636-1
00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:28.442
<v Fei Li>both capital raised and the number of
funds returned to the pre pandemic level.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2643-0
00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:31.402
<v Fei Li>So it's going to be begin to level off at
some point.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2660-0
00:20:34.722 --> 00:20:40.184
<v Fei Li>When you come to first time financing,
we're startups get their first check from</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2660-1
00:20:40.184 --> 00:20:41.802
<v Fei Li>institutional investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2673-0
00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:47.282
<v Fei Li>It shows similar trends in 2021 and the
first half of 2022.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2678-0
00:20:47.322 --> 00:20:48.602
<v Fei Li>Things are going crazy.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2706-0
00:20:49.042 --> 00:20:54.002
<v Fei Li>And moreover, other than AI,
which is still hot after open AI</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2706-1
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:59.762
<v Fei Li>introduced the Charter GPT in November
30th 2022, it employs the whole.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2716-0
00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:03.575
<v Fei Li>Overall capital market,
so that's a good thing,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2716-1
00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:05.082
<v Fei Li>but the the bad thing is.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2721-0
00:21:06.602 --> 00:21:08.482
<v Fei Li>We look at people, invest money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2739-0
00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:16.025
<v Fei Li>Into a startup as an investment vehicle.
They will expect return at some point,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2739-1
00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:20.472
<v Fei Li>but during this current strange market
times, you know.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2770-0
00:21:22.722 --> 00:21:28.203
<v Fei Li>We see when you're capitalist,
put money into something, and the exit,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2770-1
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:33.376
<v Fei Li>which means the investors get their money
back either through IPO,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2770-2
00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:38.162
<v Fei Li>the initial public offering or
acquisition becomes difficult.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2772-0
00:21:38.322 --> 00:21:39.202
<v Fei Li>That will hold them back.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2774-0
00:21:40.112 --> 00:21:40.672
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2802-0
00:21:42.162 --> 00:21:49.832
<v Fei Li>If you look at the Q 1/20/22 alone,
the exist counts dropped significantly</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2802-1
00:21:49.832 --> 00:21:53.922
<v Fei Li>from over 400 in Q 4/20/21 to about 100.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2807-0
00:21:53.922 --> 00:21:56.482
<v Fei Li>So that's about threefold decrease.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2822-0
00:21:58.912 --> 00:22:03.146
<v Fei Li>And suggesting a big influence of
industry rates change on the START</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2822-1
00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:04.312
<v Fei Li>funding activities.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2827-0
00:22:04.312 --> 00:22:06.952
<v Fei Li>So that's something to keep in mind as
well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2829-0
00:22:08.442 --> 00:22:08.962
<v Fei Li>Why is that?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2857-0
00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:16.329
<v Fei Li>Because when there's no exit and the
investors are very accustomed to put the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2857-1
00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:20.846
<v Fei Li>money to work, so they will put,
they will just stand aside,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2857-2
00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:23.512
<v Fei Li>watch to see which is the hard deal.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2867-0
00:22:23.512 --> 00:22:29.352
<v Fei Li>So which has the higher probability of
success instead of investing?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2872-0
00:22:31.522 --> 00:22:32.682
<v Fei Li>Like they did before.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2874-0
00:22:32.722 --> 00:22:34.322
<v Fei Li>So there will be more selective.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2883-0
00:22:36.122 --> 00:22:39.562
<v Fei Li>This graph shows that the dried powder
remains elevated.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2889-0
00:22:39.832 --> 00:22:41.792
<v Fei Li>Dry powder is the money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2938-0
00:22:41.832 --> 00:22:48.387
<v Fei Li>The VC investors stockpile in the bank
and are waiting to be deployed to invest</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2938-1
00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:52.403
<v Fei Li>in startups,
which are very historic high before</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2938-2
00:22:52.403 --> 00:22:56.336
<v Fei Li>pandemic,
you see it's about 1:50 here and each</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2938-3
00:22:56.336 --> 00:23:03.055
<v Fei Li>year after that, after the pandemic hit,
you see the dry powder remains elevated.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2938-4
00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:04.202
<v Fei Li>So people are.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2950-0
00:23:04.202 --> 00:23:08.232
<v Fei Li>Thinking about you know how to invest in
or the way they invest traditionally.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2955-0
00:23:09.202 --> 00:23:10.842
<v Fei Li>After we think about how they.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2960-0
00:23:11.472 --> 00:23:13.712
<v Fei Li>Allocate their assets so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2978-0
00:23:15.522 --> 00:23:21.282
<v Fei Li>And another aspect is will venture
becomes hot before before pandemic.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/2987-0
00:23:21.962 --> 00:23:27.202
<v Fei Li>The fundamentals already decided to
allocate money into the venture business.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3010-0
00:23:27.202 --> 00:23:31.169
<v Fei Li>But when pandemic hits,
there's not a much deals they could chase,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3010-1
00:23:31.169 --> 00:23:34.129
<v Fei Li>you know,
release the way to achieve their return</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3010-2
00:23:34.129 --> 00:23:34.602
<v Fei Li>profile.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3017-0
00:23:34.602 --> 00:23:36.162
<v Fei Li>So they just put the money aside.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3022-0
00:23:36.362 --> 00:23:40.722
<v Fei Li>So now those investors hold over $300
billion.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3035-0
00:23:40.992 --> 00:23:45.712
<v Fei Li>Waiting for targets to invest or acquire.
So that's a good thing.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3043-0
00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:48.832
<v Fei Li>Also a bad thing good is,
you know the investor has money.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3050-0
00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:53.441
<v Fei Li>The bad thing is, you know,
competition becomes very competitive and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3050-1
00:23:53.441 --> 00:23:53.952
<v Fei Li>usually.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3059-0
00:23:55.402 --> 00:23:57.282
<v Fei Li>Previously,
like early stage idea will get some idea.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3087-0
00:23:57.282 --> 00:24:00.726
<v Fei Li>Now you have to have some, you know,
further DE risks,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3087-1
00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:05.422
<v Fei Li>actions like customer repaying customers
further de risk technologies like</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3087-2
00:24:05.422 --> 00:24:10.306
<v Fei Li>milestones achieved especially with the
biotech space for them to write you a</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3087-3
00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:10.682
<v Fei Li>check.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3139-0
00:24:15.422 --> 00:24:20.098
<v Fei Li>Because there's more dry powder in the VC
investors pockets,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3139-1
00:24:20.098 --> 00:24:25.924
<v Fei Li>they have more power to do bigger deals
and the smaller deals like below $1</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3139-2
00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:32.209
<v Fei Li>million, which is in the blue line here.
Gradually you know becomes less and less</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3139-3
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:36.042
<v Fei Li>drops over the decades because when the
VCs have.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3158-0
00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:40.191
<v Fei Li>More money doing a smaller deal that
requires the same kind of attention and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3158-1
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:43.962
<v Fei Li>resources for the investors to conduct
due diligence on the startups.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3173-0
00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:47.691
<v Fei Li>On the technologies.
But when it comes to returning economics,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3173-1
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:51.392
<v Fei Li>maybe does not make sense to hope for
them to write a smaller check.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3197-0
00:24:52.922 --> 00:24:56.944
<v Fei Li>So that's why you know the gradually
shift when they have more money,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3197-1
00:24:56.944 --> 00:25:00.162
<v Fei Li>they shift it to write bigger checks into
single deals.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3233-0
00:25:00.162 --> 00:25:04.118
<v Fei Li>That's where you see here.
And for bigger deals, you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3233-1
00:25:04.118 --> 00:25:08.142
<v Fei Li>it's kind of gradually like for the 10 to
25,000,000 range.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3233-2
00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:13.036
<v Fei Li>That's the early stage these days.
You know previously like the Series B</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3233-3
00:25:13.036 --> 00:25:14.042
<v Fei Li>after Series A.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3241-0
00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:16.752
<v Fei Li>But now, maybe a seat or Series A.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3251-0
00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:21.752
<v Fei Li>You get that kind of money and or at 25
or $50 million range?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3267-0
00:25:21.752 --> 00:25:27.134
<v Fei Li>So you see the interest still high in
those areas because when the funds gets</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3267-1
00:25:27.134 --> 00:25:30.307
<v Fei Li>bigger,
investing those money in those checks</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3267-2
00:25:30.307 --> 00:25:32.032
<v Fei Li>will make sense for them.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3269-0
00:25:33.722 --> 00:25:34.642
<v Fei Li>Any questions?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3291-0
00:25:39.882 --> 00:25:44.455
<v Fei Li>So then for the Syrian priest C deals,
as I alluded earlier, of course,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3291-1
00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:48.202
<v Fei Li>because they have more money,
those deals get much larger.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3325-0
00:25:49.042 --> 00:25:54.949
<v Fei Li>And if you look at the smaller below,
how many voters is gradually,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3325-1
00:25:54.949 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Fei Li>you know less than 15%,
but previously was over 40% and for the 1,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3325-2
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:05.895
<v Fei Li>000,000 to $5,000,
000 the the range here is kind of level</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3325-3
00:26:05.895 --> 00:26:08.762
<v Fei Li>off. But for five to $10 million.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3333-0
00:26:09.112 --> 00:26:12.512
<v Fei Li>See the deal numbers get more in the
special.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3356-0
00:26:12.992 --> 00:26:17.343
<v Fei Li>That's the same case with the 10 to $25
million range and for this one,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3356-1
00:26:17.343 --> 00:26:21.392
<v Fei Li>I believe it's also increased as well
because of scale. You don't.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3358-0
00:26:21.392 --> 00:26:22.472
<v Fei Li>You cannot see it here.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3399-0
00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:31.925
<v Fei Li>And because the investors have more money,
meaning dry powder,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3399-1
00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:38.503
<v Fei Li>so they have the flexibility to do more
deals and then that because the deal</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3399-2
00:26:38.503 --> 00:26:45.338
<v Fei Li>numbers exist on the market is limited.
So more people chasing their deals that</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3399-3
00:26:45.338 --> 00:26:50.122
<v Fei Li>will drive up the deal value across the
board, so that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3406-0
00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:53.462
<v Fei Li>Where you see here,
especially in 2021 when.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3410-0
00:26:54.122 --> 00:26:56.282
<v Fei Li>Their hard money present so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3420-0
00:26:56.472 --> 00:27:03.712
<v Fei Li>The deal medium deal size here gets
inflated across the stages.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3425-0
00:27:05.122 --> 00:27:07.602
<v Fei Li>Especially for the for the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3467-0
00:27:09.362 --> 00:27:14.388
<v Fei Li>Early stage here and then the venture
growth stage because for venture growth</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3467-1
00:27:14.388 --> 00:27:19.543
<v Fei Li>people invest in money in a short time
horizon like three to five years or one,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3467-2
00:27:19.543 --> 00:27:24.698
<v Fei Li>two or three years hoping it's like a
flip house where you invest the money you</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3467-3
00:27:24.698 --> 00:27:25.922
<v Fei Li>want to get in and.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3473-0
00:27:25.922 --> 00:27:26.242
<v Fei Li>Quick outs.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3475-0
00:27:26.282 --> 00:27:29.122
<v Fei Li>So that's how they do it here.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3493-0
00:27:29.782 --> 00:27:33.867
<v Fei Li>And after that,
you know because of interest rates does</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3493-1
00:27:33.867 --> 00:27:37.222
<v Fei Li>not make sense in those risky assets
anymore.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3501-0
00:27:37.262 --> 00:27:42.542
<v Fei Li>So that deal like values also dropped a
little bit.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3504-0
00:27:45.532 --> 00:27:47.092
<v Fei Li>And then you see.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3506-0
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:49.082
<v Fei Li>A.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3530-0
00:27:52.842 --> 00:27:58.004
<v Fei Li>One interesting phenomena here is you
have experienced final managers who have</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3530-1
00:27:58.004 --> 00:28:01.402
<v Fei Li>done this before,
like not raising the first funds.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3536-0
00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:03.002
<v Fei Li>So they have the type of records.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3544-0
00:28:03.002 --> 00:28:05.682
<v Fei Li>That's where people will see like
athletes.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3549-0
00:28:05.682 --> 00:28:07.922
<v Fei Li>You have a record where people will rank
you.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3569-0
00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:11.751
<v Fei Li>It's the same for major capitalists,
you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3569-1
00:28:11.751 --> 00:28:17.717
<v Fei Li>they are external institutions who
provides ratings for rankings for fund</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3569-2
00:28:17.717 --> 00:28:18.442
<v Fei Li>managers.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3575-0
00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:21.362
<v Fei Li>To provide provide this as a service.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3622-0
00:28:21.752 --> 00:28:25.240
<v Fei Li>To Lp's, which is limited,
partners who provide,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3622-1
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.864
<v Fei Li>who provide money to major capitalists
because major companies normally do not</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3622-2
00:28:30.864 --> 00:28:34.993
<v Fei Li>use their own money,
they source the money from others at</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3622-3
00:28:34.993 --> 00:28:39.549
<v Fei Li>university endowments.
Pension funds Somerville's funds to pull</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3622-4
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:42.752
<v Fei Li>money together. So as you can see here,
the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3638-0
00:28:43.312 --> 00:28:47.324
<v Fei Li>Experienced managers raise more funds
than the emerging firms,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3638-1
00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:49.552
<v Fei Li>which are the new founder managers.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3643-0
00:28:49.552 --> 00:28:51.752
<v Fei Li>That means the fund the investing market.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3656-0
00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:57.472
<v Fei Li>You can really weird for experience once
it's good, but for emerging.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3661-0
00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:01.162
<v Fei Li>Will be difficult.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3664-0
00:29:01.162 --> 00:29:03.762
<v Fei Li>So that's kind of how the current.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3671-0
00:29:05.562 --> 00:29:06.842
<v Fei Li>Virtual Curve environment looks like.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3673-0
00:29:11.132 --> 00:29:11.612
<v Fei Li>See.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3683-0
00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:19.032
<v Fei Li>So the terms here you know if you look at
this graph.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3698-0
00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Fei Li>If below is a founder friendly and above
is investor friendly so it changes over</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3698-1
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.442
<v Fei Li>time horizon.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3700-0
00:29:29.442 --> 00:29:29.562
<v Fei Li>Ian.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3721-0
00:29:30.842 --> 00:29:34.088
<v Fei Li>Before the before the 2022,
as you can tell,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3721-1
00:29:34.088 --> 00:29:39.569
<v Fei Li>it's founder friendly because the
investors has has more cash and they want</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3721-2
00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:40.362
<v Fei Li>more deals.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3746-0
00:29:40.602 --> 00:29:46.200
<v Fei Li>So then the founders have the leverage to
say to negotiate the deal terms with the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3746-1
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.438
<v Fei Li>investors.
When the Fed began to raise interest</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3746-2
00:29:49.438 --> 00:29:49.842
<v Fei Li>rates.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3760-0
00:29:49.962 --> 00:29:54.419
<v Fei Li>And they gradually shift the momentum
shift to investors and where investors</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3760-1
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:57.082
<v Fei Li>has leveraged to choose which deal to
invest.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3766-0
00:29:57.802 --> 00:29:59.322
<v Fei Li>And what on their on their terms?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3784-0
00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:04.593
<v Fei Li>So that's kind of how it looks at these
days and now it's gonna gradually level</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3784-1
00:30:04.593 --> 00:30:07.032
<v Fei Li>off again because of dynamics change, so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3793-0
00:30:12.262 --> 00:30:15.022
<v Fei Li>From the VC universe.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3821-0
00:30:15.372 --> 00:30:20.863
<v Fei Li>It consists of non traditionally
investors or the corporate virtual</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3821-1
00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:25.223
<v Fei Li>capitalist,
which is investor arm of big corporations</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3821-2
00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:28.452
<v Fei Li>like Intel like Qualcomm or like Google.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3857-0
00:30:29.942 --> 00:30:35.566
<v Fei Li>So then you have the crossover which
invest both in early stage and the growth</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3857-1
00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:41.119
<v Fei Li>stage and the traditional VCs which
invest in their own you know comfort zone</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3857-2
00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:45.462
<v Fei Li>as you can see here the universe can do
shrink a little bit.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3877-0
00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:51.292
<v Fei Li>But when the traditional VC investors
gradually leaves the field,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3877-1
00:30:51.292 --> 00:30:55.612
<v Fei Li>the other players come to the to fill in
their voids.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3895-0
00:30:55.612 --> 00:31:03.121
<v Fei Li>So overall, as you probably remember,
the founder size gets bigger and also the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3895-1
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:05.092
<v Fei Li>dry powder gets more.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3907-0
00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:07.391
<v Fei Li>So that's where the contributions come
from,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3907-1
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:09.332
<v Fei Li>from the non traditional VC investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3908-0
00:31:09.572 --> 00:31:10.812
<v Fei Li>So that's good for.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3914-0
00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.982
<v Fei Li>For startups founders as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3940-0
00:31:15.652 --> 00:31:20.616
<v Fei Li>And then the valuation when you come to
exit, as I mentioned earlier,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3940-1
00:31:20.616 --> 00:31:25.509
<v Fei Li>during the good times you know,
because there are more money and the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3940-2
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:26.572
<v Fei Li>issues are low.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3952-0
00:31:26.572 --> 00:31:32.332
<v Fei Li>The valuation, the pouring costs are low,
so people are waiting to pay more.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3960-0
00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:36.292
<v Fei Li>That will drive up to accident value
evaluation as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3965-0
00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:38.252
<v Fei Li>So here is kind of by meeting.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3967-0
00:31:38.252 --> 00:31:39.332
<v Fei Li>So like the medium.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3978-0
00:31:40.582 --> 00:31:45.062
<v Fei Li>Us VC exits in typical 2021 is up.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3993-0
00:31:46.122 --> 00:31:50.405
<v Fei Li>Then $600 million of north.
But after the Fed began to raise interest</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3993-1
00:31:50.405 --> 00:31:51.322
<v Fei Li>rates, you see?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/3994-0
00:31:51.322 --> 00:31:51.802
<v Fei Li>Kind of.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4020-0
00:31:53.942 --> 00:31:59.134
<v Fei Li>Pierce the bubble so gradually jump to
the ground to one hundred $100 million</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4020-1
00:31:59.134 --> 00:32:01.996
<v Fei Li>range,
which times similar at the previous</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4020-2
00:32:01.996 --> 00:32:02.462
<v Fei Li>levels.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4025-0
00:32:02.622 --> 00:32:03.942
<v Fei Li>Even lower, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4029-0
00:32:03.942 --> 00:32:05.502
<v Fei Li>Right now it's begin.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4043-0
00:32:05.542 --> 00:32:10.638
<v Fei Li>People realized that when become more
prudent about deals,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4043-1
00:32:10.638 --> 00:32:15.302
<v Fei Li>so this level began to level up a little
bit as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4045-0
00:32:15.692 --> 00:32:16.572
<v Fei Li>In these days.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4047-0
00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:21.152
<v Fei Li>And.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4061-0
00:32:22.692 --> 00:32:28.852
<v Fei Li>Distribution here is a measurement in
terms of how investors look about.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4074-0
00:32:30.342 --> 00:32:34.622
<v Fei Li>Look at the dollar amounts they invest in
stocks.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4102-0
00:32:34.742 --> 00:32:41.248
<v Fei Li>So at some points when the these
investors invest in startups,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4102-1
00:32:41.248 --> 00:32:49.302
<v Fei Li>they have to return the money. You know,
as a profit back to their investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4104-0
00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:52.222
<v Fei Li>They'll limited partners Lp's.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4127-0
00:32:53.422 --> 00:33:00.066
<v Fei Li>So right now you see the distribution
remains extremely low because two things,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4127-1
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:04.302
<v Fei Li>one department market is very topic
turbulent, so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4138-0
00:33:05.742 --> 00:33:09.502
<v Fei Li>The IPO market opens very narrowly.
Then you close it again.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4141-0
00:33:11.702 --> 00:33:12.742
<v Fei Li>And because.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4150-0
00:33:14.582 --> 00:33:17.582
<v Fei Li>Another Ave. for exits is acquisition.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4161-0
00:33:17.622 --> 00:33:21.871
<v Fei Li>Those big corporations also are
struggling to deal with their own problem</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4161-1
00:33:21.871 --> 00:33:22.502
<v Fei Li>like Intel.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4176-0
00:33:23.252 --> 00:33:28.813
<v Fei Li>So maybe they're not so interesting.
Acquisitions without window is also</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4176-1
00:33:28.813 --> 00:33:30.412
<v Fei Li>closed without exits.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4185-0
00:33:30.572 --> 00:33:33.012
<v Fei Li>So the money just stay with it,
the startups.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4195-0
00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:38.452
<v Fei Li>So that's how the distribution remains
historically low.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4200-0
00:33:38.452 --> 00:33:41.852
<v Fei Li>If you come here,
it's even lower close to the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4211-0
00:33:43.782 --> 00:33:45.302
<v Fei Li>2008 or 2009 level.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4224-0
00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:51.461
<v Fei Li>So it's kind of interesting data to look
at to conclude the second section about</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4224-1
00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:52.982
<v Fei Li>the capital markets.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4242-0
00:33:54.202 --> 00:33:58.854
<v Fei Li>So for the third part,
I will just briefly give an overview on</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4242-1
00:33:58.854 --> 00:34:00.922
<v Fei Li>truck discovery by training.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4253-0
00:34:00.922 --> 00:34:05.922
<v Fei Li>I'm a chemist mainly doing discovery work
by working in the lab.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4282-0
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:10.809
<v Fei Li>I'm very curious about how AI can
transform this field as well,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4282-1
00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:16.968
<v Fei Li>because indeed it is making its own mark
into truck discovery and I would like to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4282-2
00:34:16.968 --> 00:34:20.122
<v Fei Li>share with you guys some insights as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4287-0
00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:24.582
<v Fei Li>So here this graph is from.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4289-0
00:34:26.462 --> 00:34:26.582
<v Fei Li>The.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4302-0
00:34:28.082 --> 00:34:34.082
<v Fei Li>A review on Nature reviews in Drug
Discovery published this year.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4333-0
00:34:34.082 --> 00:34:38.506
<v Fei Li>Early this year,
at least about topic pharma companies and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4333-1
00:34:38.506 --> 00:34:44.878
<v Fei Li>in terms of therape sales, as you can see,
those former company Johnson Jones App V,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4333-2
00:34:44.878 --> 00:34:48.402
<v Fei Li>which is based in Chicago, Merck Roch,
Pfizer.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4348-0
00:34:50.062 --> 00:34:57.582
<v Fei Li>Or billion dollar enterprise like 50 from
33 to $55 billion.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4387-0
00:34:57.932 --> 00:35:03.709
<v Fei Li>So these are rich companies and if you
look at it here from the data 2023 to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4387-1
00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:07.235
<v Fei Li>2024,
most of companies saw modest increase in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4387-2
00:35:07.235 --> 00:35:11.286
<v Fei Li>terms of revenue.
Although there are headwinds in the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4387-3
00:35:11.286 --> 00:35:14.812
<v Fei Li>company market right now,
that means pandemic.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4397-0
00:35:16.742 --> 00:35:19.942
<v Fei Li>Or other factors play a role in boosting
their revenue.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4400-0
00:35:21.662 --> 00:35:22.182
<v Fei Li>And then.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4411-0
00:35:23.982 --> 00:35:27.742
<v Fei Li>When they have more revenue,
one thing they do is to invest in R&amp;D.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4420-0
00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:31.812
<v Fei Li>So that leads to how drugs are developed
in the lab.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4431-0
00:35:33.302 --> 00:35:38.022
<v Fei Li>Drug discovery overall is a very costly
and failure.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4434-0
00:35:40.662 --> 00:35:41.182
<v Fei Li>Process so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4442-0
00:35:43.292 --> 00:35:46.052
<v Fei Li>It consists of like four parts.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4476-0
00:35:46.132 --> 00:35:50.422
<v Fei Li>One is a discovery and development,
mainly in the lab,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4476-1
00:35:50.422 --> 00:35:56.974
<v Fei Li>either in academic lab or in a corporate
lab which does similar work to make drugs.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4476-2
00:35:56.974 --> 00:36:01.732
<v Fei Li>Candidates that could be potentially
useful for for the lab.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4488-0
00:36:01.732 --> 00:36:07.532
<v Fei Li>So during this phase you want to identify
a compound, either a small molecule.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4492-0
00:36:08.422 --> 00:36:09.342
<v Fei Li>Or a biologic?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4495-0
00:36:11.582 --> 00:36:12.142
<v Fei Li>Components.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4506-0
00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:19.092
<v Fei Li>That was in culture to make it work to
treat a certain disease certain.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4548-0
00:36:21.422 --> 00:36:26.290
<v Fei Li>Areas that will work.
Then it comes to clinical research.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4548-1
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.738
<v Fei Li>So in order,
in order to make sure the drug first is</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4548-2
00:36:30.738 --> 00:36:37.536
<v Fei Li>safe to use will not cause any more any
severe the output of severe side effects</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4548-3
00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:40.222
<v Fei Li>and may not cause people to die.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4551-0
00:36:40.582 --> 00:36:42.142
<v Fei Li>So they won't do animal studies.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4571-0
00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:47.421
<v Fei Li>To prove that first is effective,
second is safe,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4571-1
00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:53.933
<v Fei Li>and then we transfer to three phases
clinical trial to conduct how the drugs</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4571-2
00:36:53.933 --> 00:36:55.032
<v Fei Li>are measured.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4590-0
00:36:56.542 --> 00:37:01.448
<v Fei Li>And for the clinical research it comes is
usually 3 phases, phase one, phase two,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4590-1
00:37:01.448 --> 00:37:03.422
<v Fei Li>phase three. Phase One is safety.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4604-0
00:37:03.542 --> 00:37:09.619
<v Fei Li>Phase two is that advocacy phase three is
the largescale clinical trial to make</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4604-1
00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:11.822
<v Fei Li>sure it's traced the disease.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4628-0
00:37:12.252 --> 00:37:18.132
<v Fei Li>Claim to and the phase four is monitors.
The disease side effects after FDA,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4628-1
00:37:18.132 --> 00:37:22.027
<v Fei Li>the Federal Drug Administration approved
the drug.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4628-2
00:37:22.027 --> 00:37:24.852
<v Fei Li>So you just like a market monitoring.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4632-0
00:37:26.092 --> 00:37:27.892
<v Fei Li>So after that you know.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4642-0
00:37:29.862 --> 00:37:31.062
<v Fei Li>The Truck Discovery company.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4659-0
00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:37.678
<v Fei Li>That's biotechs or pharma companies
submitted their experiment data to to the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4659-1
00:37:37.678 --> 00:37:42.062
<v Fei Li>FDA for regulatory approval and review
and the the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4682-0
00:37:43.902 --> 00:37:48.756
<v Fei Li>Certain agencies within the FDA were
designed to make sure the safety,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4682-1
00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:51.422
<v Fei Li>efficacy and the security of the drugs.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4686-0
00:37:52.982 --> 00:37:54.182
<v Fei Li>Carefully administered.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4710-0
00:37:54.772 --> 00:38:00.093
<v Fei Li>To ensure it will not 'cause any you know,
panic or chaos in the market when they</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4710-1
00:38:00.093 --> 00:38:02.883
<v Fei Li>approve,
because that will undermine FDA's</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4710-2
00:38:02.883 --> 00:38:03.532
<v Fei Li>authority.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4745-0
00:38:03.572 --> 00:38:08.675
<v Fei Li>So that's where that another phenomenon
when you know their budgets cut meeting</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4745-1
00:38:08.675 --> 00:38:11.801
<v Fei Li>the FDA,
the biotech industry will kind of panic</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4745-2
00:38:11.801 --> 00:38:16.904
<v Fei Li>about how will change the drug approval
process because here you see within the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4745-3
00:38:16.904 --> 00:38:20.412
<v Fei Li>discovery and development the clinical
research alone.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4756-0
00:38:21.142 --> 00:38:25.822
<v Fei Li>It takes about 645 years and then the
clinical research to complete this week.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4759-0
00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:30.052
<v Fei Li>Trials required for.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4769-0
00:38:31.822 --> 00:38:33.822
<v Fei Li>By the FDA seven years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4775-0
00:38:33.822 --> 00:38:38.222
<v Fei Li>So that's how together it's 13.5 years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4816-0
00:38:38.222 --> 00:38:44.512
<v Fei Li>So it's a very long process and the track
and field at certain points during the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4816-1
00:38:44.512 --> 00:38:50.570
<v Fei Li>123 phase of trials and after that,
you know it takes another 1 1/2 years for</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4816-2
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.462
<v Fei Li>the FDA to approve.
And one thing I forgot to mention here is.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4819-0
00:38:56.082 --> 00:38:56.562
<v Fei Li>All the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4847-0
00:38:56.642 --> 00:39:00.872
<v Fei Li>All the drugs that are developed here are
patented,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4847-1
00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:07.053
<v Fei Li>but the patent life is about 20 years.
So that means you only have 13 or 14</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4847-2
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.842
<v Fei Li>years. Some something.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4863-0
00:39:10.302 --> 00:39:13.121
<v Fei Li>When they approve your drugs so
economically,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4863-1
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:16.982
<v Fei Li>you make whether it makes sense or not.
It's another question.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4871-0
00:39:16.982 --> 00:39:21.622
<v Fei Li>Why certain companies choose to treat
certain areas?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4876-0
00:39:21.622 --> 00:39:24.942
<v Fei Li>Because they have to think about the
investment return.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4878-0
00:39:25.252 --> 00:39:26.372
<v Fei Li>Profile as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4896-0
00:39:28.722 --> 00:39:32.735
<v Fei Li>It's kind of this slides kind of a follow
up with the previous slides I showed you</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4896-1
00:39:32.735 --> 00:39:33.122
<v Fei Li>earlier.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4903-0
00:39:33.202 --> 00:39:37.402
<v Fei Li>So the pharma companies want to show
efficiency.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4905-0
00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:38.002
<v Fei Li>That's kind of.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4951-0
00:39:39.352 --> 00:39:45.424
<v Fei Li>With challenges, it takes about 10 years.
As I show in the previous slides about $2.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4951-1
00:39:45.424 --> 00:39:49.352
<v Fei Li>6 billion truck to just single out one
truck compound.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4968-0
00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:54.247
<v Fei Li>You started with over 10 thousands
compound kinase screen with.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4968-1
00:39:54.247 --> 00:39:55.922
<v Fei Li>So how would they do that?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4987-0
00:39:56.002 --> 00:40:01.809
<v Fei Li>Usually previously just manually based on
experience like I do I make I make a</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4987-1
00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:04.602
<v Fei Li>compound, you know, then honey to the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/4994-0
00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.552
<v Fei Li>Drug. Let me see. Who are they?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5000-0
00:40:09.872 --> 00:40:12.952
<v Fei Li>So will be the pharma kinetics guys.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5004-0
00:40:12.992 --> 00:40:15.072
<v Fei Li>Who will test the drug and then?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5014-0
00:40:16.632 --> 00:40:19.752
<v Fei Li>This one, 10,
000 drug will down select to 250 drugs.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5042-0
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:25.386
<v Fei Li>In the pre clinical development,
that means testing team in mice in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5042-1
00:40:25.386 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Fei Li>monkeys to make sure you know they are
safe and they are effective in treating</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5042-2
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.502
<v Fei Li>certain tumors like cancer, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5064-0
00:40:33.502 --> 00:40:38.264
<v Fei Li>You have cancer tumor.
So you deliberately implant the cancer</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5064-1
00:40:38.264 --> 00:40:44.331
<v Fei Li>tumor into those animals and inject the
drugs to make sure they are effective.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5064-2
00:40:44.331 --> 00:40:45.022
<v Fei Li>And then.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5075-0
00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:49.472
<v Fei Li>There will be 5 candidates moved to the
clinical developments.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5117-0
00:40:50.022 --> 00:40:57.117
<v Fei Li>Know to test efficacy safety effecti S in
treating the claim disease and then also</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5117-1
00:40:57.117 --> 00:41:04.127
<v Fei Li>the large scale safety and effectiveness.
Then after that submits the data across</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5117-2
00:41:04.127 --> 00:41:11.222
<v Fei Li>the different stages to FDA approval and
in the end will be one drug get approved.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5122-0
00:41:11.222 --> 00:41:13.942
<v Fei Li>So it's a very long, laborious process.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5134-0
00:41:16.112 --> 00:41:20.432
<v Fei Li>And that's where you know when people
think about AI and the solution here.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5166-0
00:41:20.982 --> 00:41:26.837
<v Fei Li>To this problem come from like 3 errors.
You know whether like the business model</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5166-1
00:41:26.837 --> 00:41:32.121
<v Fei Li>or worse collaboration and pipeline
diversification early that instead of</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5166-2
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:36.262
<v Fei Li>testing like Discovery 10,
000 compounds manually, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5179-0
00:41:36.262 --> 00:41:40.822
<v Fei Li>Can you do it with AI instead of you know,
try 22150 compounds.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5200-0
00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:44.873
<v Fei Li>Can we diversify the pipelines early to
using, you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5200-1
00:41:44.873 --> 00:41:49.399
<v Fei Li>machine learning tools to help us
classify the different different</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5200-2
00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:50.142
<v Fei Li>categories?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5225-0
00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Fei Li>Then you know we can remove certain
compounds that we initially supposed to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5225-1
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.004
<v Fei Li>test,
but we don't need to test because on</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5225-2
00:41:58.004 --> 00:42:01.462
<v Fei Li>computer we already know they were not
going to work.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5252-0
00:42:01.782 --> 00:42:07.288
<v Fei Li>And also your information of AI as a
universe shift these days towards data</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5252-1
00:42:07.288 --> 00:42:12.939
<v Fei Li>centric drug discovery especially you
know doing we will have data with virus</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5252-2
00:42:12.939 --> 00:42:14.822
<v Fei Li>molecules you test before.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5265-0
00:42:15.752 --> 00:42:19.184
<v Fei Li>So then you can think about how we can
leverage that data to catch you with</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5265-1
00:42:19.184 --> 00:42:19.952
<v Fei Li>struck discovery.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5316-0
00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:27.019
<v Fei Li>And last part, last aspect is discovery,
with the newest reported therapeutic</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5316-1
00:42:27.019 --> 00:42:32.674
<v Fei Li>modalities like biologics which use the
biologic and compound instead of a small</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5316-2
00:42:32.674 --> 00:42:37.842
<v Fei Li>molecule to treat disease and then
therapies like different therapy areas</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5316-3
00:42:37.842 --> 00:42:41.612
<v Fei Li>like cell therapy, gene therapy,
something like that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5321-0
00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:46.172
<v Fei Li>And then also think about what kind of
like.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5328-0
00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:50.512
<v Fei Li>Identity you want treats is lung cancer.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5336-0
00:42:51.222 --> 00:42:53.702
<v Fei Li>Or a brace counter.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5347-0
00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:57.940
<v Fei Li>So different kinds of different
metabolite is a pathway.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5347-1
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.022
<v Fei Li>So that's different as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5354-0
00:43:01.942 --> 00:43:03.782
<v Fei Li>And that kind of leads me to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5364-0
00:43:04.942 --> 00:43:07.782
<v Fei Li>Share these lies about what are we claim
here?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5388-0
00:43:08.102 --> 00:43:12.877
<v Fei Li>You know you guys are, you know,
very good error where if I implant AI to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5388-1
00:43:12.877 --> 00:43:17.523
<v Fei Li>help you do a lot of stuff and here we
can say claim AI can do a lot of</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5388-2
00:43:17.523 --> 00:43:18.942
<v Fei Li>interrupt discoveries.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5405-0
00:43:18.982 --> 00:43:24.359
<v Fei Li>So this one is a graph adopted from a
trust server today,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5405-1
00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:26.862
<v Fei Li>but as you can think about.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5407-0
00:43:28.592 --> 00:43:28.712
<v Fei Li>The.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5413-0
00:43:30.192 --> 00:43:32.672
<v Fei Li>Weird errors of AI can help you starting
from.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5415-0
00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:34.832
<v Fei Li>Drug discovery.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5443-0
00:43:35.142 --> 00:43:40.206
<v Fei Li>Like initial job design at the protein
structure prediction,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5443-1
00:43:40.206 --> 00:43:46.182
<v Fei Li>because when you put a small molecule
into your body, it has a protein.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5481-0
00:43:46.182 --> 00:43:50.715
<v Fei Li>The protein has certain structures to
make it compatible with the drug</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5481-1
00:43:50.715 --> 00:43:53.843
<v Fei Li>candidates,
so that's where you think about when</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5481-2
00:43:53.843 --> 00:43:58.249
<v Fei Li>designed the drug skeleton,
where it could make sense for the better</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5481-3
00:43:58.249 --> 00:44:02.462
<v Fei Li>matches the protein and then the drug
protein interaction, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5488-0
00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:05.352
<v Fei Li>And then after the design you have the
screen.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5499-0
00:44:05.782 --> 00:44:09.930
<v Fei Li>As I should, 10,
000 compounds in the previous slides you</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5499-1
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:10.502
<v Fei Li>have to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5508-0
00:44:11.992 --> 00:44:15.432
<v Fei Li>Screen with the activity,
whether it's it will be good.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5551-0
00:44:17.192 --> 00:44:21.519
<v Fei Li>To treat the disease,
whether it will be toxic is that means</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5551-1
00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:25.066
<v Fei Li>when you take the drug,
you will not kill people.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5551-2
00:44:25.066 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Fei Li>And so that's where you can use AI to do
that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5551-3
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:34.145
<v Fei Li>And then the physical chemical properties
prediction like whether it's stolable,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5551-4
00:44:34.145 --> 00:44:36.202
<v Fei Li>whether it will cause some B.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5555-0
00:44:36.192 --> 00:44:37.552
<v Fei Li>Problems in other parts of the body.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5568-0
00:44:37.822 --> 00:44:42.035
<v Fei Li>We want treat lung cancer,
but in your kidney cause some damage your</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5568-1
00:44:42.035 --> 00:44:42.462
<v Fei Li>kidney.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5586-0
00:44:42.462 --> 00:44:48.652
<v Fei Li>So that's where you do that beforehand.
And then like you can do it with</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5586-1
00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:52.382
<v Fei Li>pharmaceutical product development as
well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5608-0
00:44:52.422 --> 00:44:59.319
<v Fei Li>So you use AI to add deciding suitable
experience and the morning turn to modify</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5608-1
00:44:59.319 --> 00:45:03.662
<v Fei Li>the development process,
because then with AI now.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5621-0
00:45:04.392 --> 00:45:07.185
<v Fei Li>I think about how you can streamline the
whole R&amp;</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5621-1
00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:10.392
<v Fei Li>D process with data embedded in each step
with AM monitoring.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5674-0
00:45:12.102 --> 00:45:15.666
<v Fei Li>Also,
the Pharmaceut product management like</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5674-1
00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:21.843
<v Fei Li>the market positioning and the market
prediction analysis where you penetrate</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5674-2
00:45:21.843 --> 00:45:28.179
<v Fei Li>the market and what's the responding rate
for market for the market and how the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5674-3
00:45:28.179 --> 00:45:34.673
<v Fei Li>cost will look like a different group of
across different countries and different</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5674-4
00:45:34.673 --> 00:45:35.702
<v Fei Li>demographies.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5685-0
00:45:36.552 --> 00:45:41.512
<v Fei Li>And on the other side,
like say when you have a drug candidate.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5702-0
00:45:42.462 --> 00:45:47.629
<v Fei Li>You want to clinical drug design
monitoring that AI also hope you improve</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5702-1
00:45:47.629 --> 00:45:50.422
<v Fei Li>the success rates of the clinical trial.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5710-0
00:45:51.992 --> 00:45:53.872
<v Fei Li>By adding some data.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5731-0
00:45:54.312 --> 00:45:58.059
<v Fei Li>Previously it was unknown,
but now you know it will.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5731-1
00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:03.361
<v Fei Li>It will cause more artifacts in your
clinical trial that will undercut the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5731-2
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:05.552
<v Fei Li>quality of your clinical trial.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5755-0
00:46:06.782 --> 00:46:11.762
<v Fei Li>And then during the drug manufacturing
process, the quality analysis,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5755-1
00:46:11.762 --> 00:46:17.453
<v Fei Li>QA and then quality control QC also you
can integrate it together with an AI to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5755-2
00:46:17.453 --> 00:46:18.022
<v Fei Li>do that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5790-0
00:46:19.672 --> 00:46:24.598
<v Fei Li>That's kind of manufacturing I think
right now you the automating</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5790-1
00:46:24.598 --> 00:46:30.419
<v Fei Li>manufacturing to monitor the batch to
batch virus where you think about batch</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5790-2
00:46:30.419 --> 00:46:35.792
<v Fei Li>manufacturing lots will spot it and
that's where we think that as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5812-0
00:46:39.512 --> 00:46:46.652
<v Fei Li>These slides is more about the current AI
for drug discovery landscapes. As you see,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5812-1
00:46:46.652 --> 00:46:48.752
<v Fei Li>the logos are very small.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5842-0
00:46:48.752 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Fei Li>I didn't explain to see those small
numbers and it spread into spread into</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5842-1
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.364
<v Fei Li>three,
you know aspects like pharma and CRO</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5842-2
00:46:58.364 --> 00:47:03.857
<v Fei Li>which is contract research organization
which does the research Rd.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5842-3
00:47:03.857 --> 00:47:05.472
<v Fei Li>work for the farmer.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5852-0
00:47:06.232 --> 00:47:09.672
<v Fei Li>Or biotech startups like doing the
political validation.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5859-0
00:47:10.062 --> 00:47:13.262
<v Fei Li>Edward testing screening work and the tag.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5873-0
00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:20.352
<v Fei Li>Which is the traditional sense,
has not has nothing to do with biotech.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5881-0
00:47:20.432 --> 00:47:22.552
<v Fei Li>But they want because they know tech.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5886-0
00:47:22.552 --> 00:47:23.072
<v Fei Li>They know AI.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5894-0
00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:28.312
<v Fei Li>They want also capture the trends with
the expanding application as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5916-0
00:47:30.072 --> 00:47:39.854
<v Fei Li>And here these reports shows surveyed
about 240 AI companies and 6600 investors</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5916-1
00:47:39.854 --> 00:47:40.832
<v Fei Li>and 990.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5953-0
00:47:42.352 --> 00:47:48.905
<v Fei Li>Cooperation across different continents
and a take away message here is you see</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5953-1
00:47:48.905 --> 00:47:55.539
<v Fei Li>us still the bellwether for AI investing
in drug discovery in terms of number of</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5953-2
00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.832
<v Fei Li>startups and total invested.</v>

00:48:00.872 --> 00:48:05.086
<v Fei Li>And then as I mentioned earlier,
at the very beginning,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5968-1
00:48:05.086 --> 00:48:08.472
<v Fei Li>a discovery companies are making real
drugs.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5993-0
00:48:08.872 --> 00:48:15.663
<v Fei Li>So these are the bigger logos you can see
clearly that in which is a company that's</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/5993-1
00:48:15.663 --> 00:48:20.352

00:48:22.632 --> 00:48:24.032
<v Fei Li>So if you look at different.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6010-0
00:48:26.712 --> 00:48:31.432
<v Fei Li>Access and different verticals.
Here AI can do a lot of stuff.</v>

00:48:32.132 --> 00:48:36.047
<v Fei Li>For the last AI tool for specific user
case,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6061-1
00:48:36.047 --> 00:48:43.441
<v Fei Li>let's say monitor the program interaction,
monitor toxicity and also AI for multiple</v>

<v Fei Li>Us and EU, especially us,
are the big powerhouse for enterprise it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6204-0
00:50:07.712 --> 00:50:09.632
<v Fei Li>So, which develops those AI tools?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6223-0
00:50:09.672 --> 00:50:14.648
<v Fei Li>So they have the technology,
they have the capital to back, you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6223-1
00:50:14.648 --> 00:50:18.912
<v Fei Li>to find another use case for their
computational power, so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6246-0
00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:24.000
<v Fei Li>For us,
over half of the severe companies based</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6246-1
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.032
<v Fei Li>in us then for EU and UK see close to 30%.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6286-0
00:50:28.182 --> 00:50:34.824
<v Fei Li>That speaks 80% of the market activities
then in Canada as another 5%,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6286-1
00:50:34.824 --> 00:50:39.033
<v Fei Li>you can tell in North America and UK and
it,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6286-2
00:50:39.033 --> 00:50:46.423
<v Fei Li>EU Europe basically dominates in this
direct discovery as well and is worth to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6286-3
00:50:46.423 --> 00:50:52.222
<v Fei Li>mention that China is catching up in
terms of biotech invest.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6294-0
00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:54.902
<v Fei Li>And also AI in drug discovery as well
because.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6301-0
00:50:55.632 --> 00:50:57.872
<v Fei Li>You know the recent release with deep
sick.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6317-0
00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:02.387
<v Fei Li>Has a lot of user case as well.
Especially I think.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6317-1
00:51:02.387 --> 00:51:07.382
<v Fei Li>I believe some companies working with
them to develop drugs as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6330-0
00:51:09.462 --> 00:51:15.785
<v Fei Li>Here,
you know it's a map for the top 50 AF for</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6330-1
00:51:15.785 --> 00:51:17.102
<v Fei Li>investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6354-0
00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:23.588
<v Fei Li>Across the map,
you can tell basically you know the most</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6354-1
00:51:23.588 --> 00:51:30.517
<v Fei Li>of the active investors are based in us
because us eventually investors are more</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6354-2
00:51:30.517 --> 00:51:32.912
<v Fei Li>risk tolerance unlike other.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6363-0
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.072
<v Fei Li>Investors in different geographies.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6365-0
00:51:36.472 --> 00:51:38.352
<v Fei Li>So there are big thinkers.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6368-0
00:51:38.742 --> 00:51:39.822
<v Fei Li>They want.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6390-0
00:51:39.822 --> 00:51:43.863
<v Fei Li>They are willing to take bigger risk to
chase bigger returns.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6390-1
00:51:43.863 --> 00:51:46.861
<v Fei Li>So that's how you know those top name
brands,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6390-2
00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:49.142
<v Fei Li>which recovery firms are basing us.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6416-0
00:51:51.472 --> 00:51:58.893
<v Fei Li>In hallways cost adventures that will Bas
in the Bay Area and also from this map,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6416-1
00:51:58.893 --> 00:52:06.132
<v Fei Li>you can tell the Bay Area is most active
with more investors least in that area</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6416-2
00:52:06.132 --> 00:52:08.032
<v Fei Li>and the Y Combinator.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6432-0
00:52:08.852 --> 00:52:13.972
<v Fei Li>Is a top combinator that incubates from
this very early stage.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6450-0
00:52:13.972 --> 00:52:18.603
<v Fei Li>The priest states that university,
so if you have ideas you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6450-1
00:52:18.603 --> 00:52:22.252
<v Fei Li>try think about whether you can go to Y
Combinator.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6472-0
00:52:22.252 --> 00:52:29.213
<v Fei Li>That's a very good venue for young guys
that you to think about creating a</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6472-1
00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:31.812
<v Fei Li>company but not biotech, OK.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6476-0
00:52:31.812 --> 00:52:34.172
<v Fei Li>Biotech. Yeah, is a different game and.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6490-0
00:52:34.832 --> 00:52:37.960
<v Fei Li>In Illinois,
that the major partners where I worked in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6490-1
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.552
<v Fei Li>the past, during my time as.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6497-0
00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:42.342
<v Fei Li>Intern also invest heavily.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6514-0
00:52:42.382 --> 00:52:47.338
<v Fei Li>That's kind of the top biotech
specialists across the world for</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6514-1
00:52:47.338 --> 00:52:48.422
<v Fei Li>Massachusetts.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6518-0
00:52:48.622 --> 00:52:50.662
<v Fei Li>That's where biotech is.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6552-0
00:52:50.662 --> 00:52:55.892
<v Fei Li>Mecca lies because of MIT and Harvard and
others venture General Catalyst,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6552-1
00:52:55.892 --> 00:53:01.260
<v Fei Li>Server ventures, even the F Prime,
which is the fidelity of the data venture</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6552-2
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.862
<v Fei Li>funds. They are big backers of biotechs,
so they also red checks.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6561-0
00:53:06.872 --> 00:53:09.672
<v Fei Li>For drug discovery,
so does the RA Capital Management.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6579-0
00:53:09.942 --> 00:53:15.342
<v Fei Li>With the big ask, the management firm,
basically Massachusetts as well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6621-0
00:53:15.422 --> 00:53:21.508
<v Fei Li>So for China is catching up and I think
there are more company more listed here</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6621-1
00:53:21.508 --> 00:53:27.745
<v Fei Li>investing in those areas because with the
maturity of biotech investing in China,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6621-2
00:53:27.745 --> 00:53:33.983
<v Fei Li>those traditional sense of tech investors
follow their footsteps of their Western</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6621-3
00:53:33.983 --> 00:53:37.862
<v Fei Li>counterparts to chase the deals in those
areas as.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6623-0
00:53:37.862 --> 00:53:38.222
<v Fei Li>Well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6635-0
00:53:38.662 --> 00:53:43.748
<v Fei Li>So for UK it has a few names,
but I'm not too familiar with those,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6635-1
00:53:43.748 --> 00:53:45.342
<v Fei Li>so I will skip those.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6656-0
00:53:46.992 --> 00:53:54.112
<v Fei Li>The last slides here regarding this part
is, you know everyone has his own moments.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6663-0
00:53:54.152 --> 00:53:56.832
<v Fei Li>So that's pharma moments.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6670-0
00:53:57.072 --> 00:54:01.512
<v Fei Li>Think about when am first started in the
1990s, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6681-0
00:54:01.512 --> 00:54:05.098
<v Fei Li>It's more about the fundamental
breakthroughs in theory,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6681-1
00:54:05.098 --> 00:54:07.552
<v Fei Li>like deep learning like ALP, et cetera.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6697-0
00:54:08.022 --> 00:54:12.822
<v Fei Li>Then he gradually involved with the
increased capacity of computational power</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6697-1
00:54:12.822 --> 00:54:14.422
<v Fei Li>and people's intelligence.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6698-0
00:54:14.622 --> 00:54:16.342
<v Fei Li>Then you know it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6731-0
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:23.971
<v Fei Li>Break up in during the 2018 to 2019
period when our goal was released by</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6731-1
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:31.181
<v Fei Li>Google and Deep in Mind Group,
you know can release an algorithm can</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6731-2
00:54:31.181 --> 00:54:33.062
<v Fei Li>precisely predict.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6743-0
00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:37.232
<v Fei Li>Protein structure and create some protein
that will never seen before in nature.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6752-0
00:54:37.932 --> 00:54:41.172
<v Fei Li>So that leads to them to where the Nobel
Prize.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6758-0
00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:44.112
<v Fei Li>Lecture last year so.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6760-0
00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:46.722
<v Fei Li>Then.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6783-0
00:54:49.312 --> 00:54:55.030
<v Fei Li>Flash forward now because the technology
is more mature and we understand better</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6783-1
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.912
<v Fei Li>about AI and also different process in
drug discovery.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6790-0
00:54:58.912 --> 00:55:00.952
<v Fei Li>How we can integrate them together?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6803-0
00:55:00.992 --> 00:55:05.952
<v Fei Li>So there will be a strategic competition
that will be introduced among Ai's tasks.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6813-0
00:55:06.032 --> 00:55:10.472
<v Fei Li>How we can work together collectively
while still maintain competitive?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6817-0
00:55:10.512 --> 00:55:13.072
<v Fei Li>So then that will raise to.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6822-0
00:55:14.392 --> 00:55:15.592
<v Fei Li>A rising wave of investment.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6869-0
00:55:16.822 --> 00:55:21.867
<v Fei Li>Or and merge and acquisition deals
because when funds get bigger,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6869-1
00:55:21.867 --> 00:55:28.212
<v Fei Li>is that to make the font more attractive,
it makes sense to acquire small startups</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6869-2
00:55:28.212 --> 00:55:33.792
<v Fei Li>to as their starting points and invest in
fusion new capital to make new</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6869-3
00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:38.072
<v Fei Li>discoveries on top of the starb effort.
Then that will.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6884-0
00:55:38.072 --> 00:55:41.875
<v Fei Li>Make the investments horizon shorter
instead of 10 years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6884-1
00:55:41.875 --> 00:55:45.022
<v Fei Li>15 years you can achieve in six to eight
years.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6892-0
00:55:45.462 --> 00:55:47.982
<v Fei Li>So that's kind of another game we found
gets bigger.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6922-0
00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:54.206
<v Fei Li>And the take away here is, you know,
the current investment markets face</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6922-1
00:55:54.206 --> 00:55:58.642
<v Fei Li>uncertainty from both hinge rates and
another is the current policy.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6922-2
00:55:58.642 --> 00:55:59.992
<v Fei Li>I didn't put up here.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6945-0
00:56:01.672 --> 00:56:06.346
<v Fei Li>And people, investors like certainty,
right? When there's uncertainty,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6945-1
00:56:06.346 --> 00:56:11.152
<v Fei Li>will be difficult for them to decide what
to invest and where to invest.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6952-0
00:56:11.872 --> 00:56:16.312
<v Fei Li>So the two the role of computation tools
in drug discovery.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6998-0
00:56:16.702 --> 00:56:21.215
<v Fei Li>And developments is coming,
is becoming increasing increasingly</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6998-1
00:56:21.215 --> 00:56:26.222
<v Fei Li>important due to the rapid developments
of computational tools in both</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6998-2
00:56:26.222 --> 00:56:31.228
<v Fei Li>computational chemistry and biology,
especially computational biology,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6998-3
00:56:31.228 --> 00:56:36.376
<v Fei Li>to improve the research efficiency and
reducing the cost of research and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/6998-4
00:56:36.376 --> 00:56:37.222
<v Fei Li>development.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7020-0
00:56:38.582 --> 00:56:42.057
<v Fei Li>We believe,
like I hope the entire success of AI</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7020-1
00:56:42.057 --> 00:56:46.382
<v Fei Li>depends on the availability of a
substantial amount of data.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7037-0
00:56:46.382 --> 00:56:50.011
<v Fei Li>That's gonna be universal across
different spectrums.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7037-1
00:56:50.011 --> 00:56:54.782
<v Fei Li>In other user case because this data
sometimes often proprietary with.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7065-0
00:56:56.752 --> 00:57:01.687
<v Fei Li>Within certain organizations,
RMD Center is not a shared publicly,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7065-1
00:57:01.687 --> 00:57:07.580
<v Fei Li>so it's hard for people to get those data
access to those data and use for some</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7065-2
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.832
<v Fei Li>sort of training.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7077-0
00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:13.062
<v Fei Li>Provide to the system to make the model
more accurate or applicable.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7119-0
00:57:13.502 --> 00:57:17.521
<v Fei Li>And lastly,
the decreasing of AI interactive research</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7119-1
00:57:17.521 --> 00:57:22.953
<v Fei Li>not only test the limits of time,
we know AI can shorten the time of job</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7119-2
00:57:22.953 --> 00:57:29.279
<v Fei Li>discovery and also technology gets better,
but also represents the humans request to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7119-3
00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:35.232
<v Fei Li>chatter territory. Like I said earlier,
with AI can develop proteins that will.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7126-0
00:57:35.232 --> 00:57:37.342
<v Fei Li>Not exist in nature and it works as a
drug.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7137-0
00:57:37.952 --> 00:57:41.432
<v Fei Li>And signify a loan and difficult journey
ahead.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7151-0
00:57:41.432 --> 00:57:45.752
<v Fei Li>So that's where we need, you know,
young man like you guys to join us.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7173-0

<v Fei Li>Join hands to this journey to push the
frontiers of technology and innovations</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7173-1
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.832
<v Fei Li>to the next level and benefits the whole
human kind with that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7181-0
00:57:55.912 --> 00:57:58.564
<v Fei Li>You know,
I know it's kind of a little fast to</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7181-1
00:57:58.564 --> 00:57:59.072
<v Fei Li>overview.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7191-0
00:57:59.152 --> 00:58:03.192
<v Fei Li>I want to thank you for your attention,
and here's my contact information and.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7200-0
00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:07.352
<v Fei Li>I'm I'm open to any questions you have at
this moment.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7214-0
00:58:10.162 --> 00:58:13.027
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
definitely add Doctor Li on LinkedIn if</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7214-1
00:58:13.027 --> 00:58:15.642
<v Hou, Eric>you have any investment kind of questions.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7218-0
00:58:17.152 --> 00:58:18.032
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions folks?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7220-0
00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:23.012
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7238-0
00:58:24.952 --> 00:58:29.891
<v Benbenek, MATT>So you mentioned like all the regulatory
testing that needs to go through to make</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7235-0
00:58:29.012 --> 00:58:29.212
<v Fei Li>Mm hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7238-1
00:58:29.891 --> 00:58:30.312
<v Benbenek, MATT>a drug.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7259-0
00:58:30.312 --> 00:58:37.109
<v Benbenek, MATT>Are there any limitations or regulations
from like FDA or some other regulatory</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7259-1
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:39.912
<v Benbenek, MATT>bodies that won't allow AI usage?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7272-0
00:58:42.412 --> 00:58:45.805
<v Fei Li>So right,
I think the main issue here is privacy,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7272-1
00:58:45.805 --> 00:58:46.212
<v Fei Li>right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7284-0
00:58:46.572 --> 00:58:51.932
<v Fei Li>So unlike other countries,
us put particular emphas data accuracy,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7284-1
00:58:51.932 --> 00:58:54.092
<v Fei Li>especially from physicians.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7303-0
00:58:54.092 --> 00:58:57.838
<v Fei Li>That's kinda one barrier,
but the good thing is, you know,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7303-1
00:58:57.838 --> 00:59:02.092
<v Fei Li>recently the FDA dropped the requirement
for small animal testing.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7327-0
00:59:03.672 --> 00:59:08.326
<v Fei Li>For for a pre clinical trials.
So that's that's because now they believe</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7327-1
00:59:08.326 --> 00:59:11.832
<v Fei Li>AI can do a better job than just putting
kill animals.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7333-0
00:59:12.222 --> 00:59:13.262
<v Fei Li>You know, make them suffer.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7338-0
00:59:13.262 --> 00:59:15.862
<v Fei Li>So it's another way of thinking about it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7363-0
00:59:18.832 --> 00:59:23.036
<v Benbenek, MATT>A follow up question,
do you see any on your last slide you</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7346-0
00:59:20.182 --> 00:59:20.382
<v Fei Li>Mm hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7363-1
00:59:23.036 --> 00:59:28.852
<v Benbenek, MATT>mentioned that like all the AI or success
go back one more or go forward one more,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7363-2
00:59:28.852 --> 00:59:29.272
<v Benbenek, MATT>sorry.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7378-0
00:59:30.992 --> 00:59:33.308
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah,
this one success depends on the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7378-1
00:59:33.308 --> 00:59:36.112
<v Benbenek, MATT>availability of a substantial amount of
data.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7380-0
00:59:36.752 --> 00:59:36.952
<v Fei Li>Mm hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7391-0
00:59:37.752 --> 00:59:40.477
<v Benbenek, MATT>Does this mean that,
like companies would have to share data</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7391-1
00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:41.192
<v Benbenek, MATT>with each other?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7400-0
00:59:42.052 --> 00:59:44.451
<v Fei Li>Yeah,
that's that's what they are doing right</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7393-0
00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:43.112
<v Benbenek, MATT>1st.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7400-1
00:59:44.451 --> 00:59:44.972
<v Fei Li>now, yeah.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7401-0
00:59:45.502 --> 00:59:46.142
<v Benbenek, MATT>OK.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7407-0
00:59:46.512 --> 00:59:48.112
<v Fei Li>Yes, very good insight.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7409-0
00:59:51.132 --> 00:59:51.652
<v Benbenek, MATT>Thank you.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7414-0
00:59:55.482 --> 00:59:57.082
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I have a question about the.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7431-0
00:59:58.632 --> 01:00:02.272
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Deal structure when it comes to seed and
pre seed funding.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7427-0
01:00:01.662 --> 01:00:01.862
<v Fei Li>Mm hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7451-0
01:00:02.272 --> 01:00:05.299
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So, you know,
we saw the graphs that you showed that</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7451-1
01:00:05.299 --> 01:00:09.924
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>there's an increase in pre pre seed and
seed funding right now along with bigger</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7451-2
01:00:09.924 --> 01:00:10.552
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>deal sizes.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7455-0
01:00:11.112 --> 01:00:14.232
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Is there any correlation or causation
between those two?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7467-0
01:00:16.032 --> 01:00:19.242
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>When it comes to, you know,
giving up equity or anything like that in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7467-1
01:00:19.242 --> 01:00:19.792
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>those deals?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7474-0
01:00:21.612 --> 01:00:23.212
<v Fei Li>So that's a very good question.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7484-0
01:00:25.032 --> 01:00:27.512
<v Fei Li>And it depends on what kind of investors
you are talking to, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7497-0
01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:33.392
<v Fei Li>Seasonal investor, you know,
will ask for a reasonable stake.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7504-0
01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:39.022
<v Fei Li>It will not compromise the incentive from
founders to work hard for them.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7507-0
01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:40.782
<v Fei Li>You know, even though what I'm saying.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7512-0
01:00:43.462 --> 01:00:43.982
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Yeah, yeah.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7517-0
01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.482
<v Fei Li>Yeah, that's kind of how I think about it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7538-0
01:00:46.722 --> 01:00:51.608
<v Fei Li>So if if, like, say,
investors squeeze you really hard,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7538-1
01:00:51.608 --> 01:00:56.842
<v Fei Li>let's say usually you give 20 to 30% in
in terms of equity.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7555-0
01:00:58.312 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Fei Li>In exchange for investment, right,
if the investor come in,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7555-1
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.632
<v Fei Li>squeeze you like over 80% or 60%.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7573-0
01:01:06.712 --> 01:01:10.451
<v Fei Li>And you think about, OK,
am I working for myself or am I working</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7573-1
01:01:10.451 --> 01:01:12.752
<v Fei Li>for the investors who get benefits more?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7576-0
01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.192
<v Fei Li>So that'll kind of discourage.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7598-0
01:01:14.822 --> 01:01:19.326
<v Fei Li>The startup founders to work harder to
align their interests,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7598-1
01:01:19.326 --> 01:01:24.702
<v Fei Li>so a savvy investor will not do that
because they will syndicate usually.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7642-0
01:01:26.112 --> 01:01:31.985
<v Fei Li>For a rounds is not achieved fulfilled by
1 investor who will fund different global</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7642-1
01:01:31.985 --> 01:01:37.299
<v Fei Li>investors to get to invest together to
form a group to complement their own</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7642-2
01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:42.753
<v Fei Li>expertise and also strategic thinking
about why they want each other to be in</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7642-3
01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:43.592
<v Fei Li>that around.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7649-0
01:01:48.482 --> 01:01:49.562
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>OK. That makes a lot of sense.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7655-0
01:01:49.562 --> 01:01:52.042
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I love follow up question kind of.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7654-0
01:01:52.082 --> 01:01:52.282
<v Fei Li>Mm hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7697-0
01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:57.329
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Along with funding,
so we have less deals being made but a</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7697-1
01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:00.421
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>higher size.
Are there anything that you're seeing</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7697-2
01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:05.452
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>right now that are so different startups
are trying to compete with each other for</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7697-3
01:02:05.452 --> 01:02:08.241
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>investments?
Are the ones who are getting the</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7697-4
01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:11.272
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>investment setting themselves apart in a
certain?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7701-0
01:02:11.272 --> 01:02:13.112
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Way or anything like that.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7703-0
01:02:14.722 --> 01:02:15.242
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7710-0
01:02:17.462 --> 01:02:21.182
<v Fei Li>The way I will think about it is.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7729-0
01:02:22.662 --> 01:02:26.381
<v Fei Li>When the the number of startups are
limited right 'cause?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7729-1
01:02:26.381 --> 01:02:31.702
<v Fei Li>If you remember the the graph I showed,
but the number of investors get some more.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7771-0
01:02:33.142 --> 01:02:37.545
<v Fei Li>So it depends on like what you need from
the investors.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7771-1
01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:43.128
<v Fei Li>When at some point you you'll receive
several several term sheets from</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7771-2
01:02:43.128 --> 01:02:47.845
<v Fei Li>different investors.
The terms are definitely different and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7771-3
01:02:47.845 --> 01:02:54.136
<v Fei Li>you have to make a decision about which
one you think is best aligned with your</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7771-4
01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:55.472
<v Fei Li>vision and Motiv.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7773-0
01:02:55.742 --> 01:02:56.342
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7781-0
01:02:57.792 --> 01:03:02.192
<v Fei Li>It is different and also it is difficult.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7785-0
01:03:06.702 --> 01:03:07.462

<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Thank you.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7819-0

<v Hou, Eric>So I have a question.
So then based upon the current you know</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7819-1
01:03:23.146 --> 01:03:28.111

how does it hold on call help you guys</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7819-2

<v Hou, Eric>with fundraising and then how does it
affect the the post sender at this moment?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7827-0
01:03:34.182 --> 01:03:37.462
<v Fei Li>So right now we're having a town hall to
discuss it.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7832-0
01:03:37.862 --> 01:03:40.022
<v Fei Li>You know, sometime next next week.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7838-0
01:03:40.022 --> 01:03:41.022
<v Fei Li>So we'll see.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7834-0
01:03:40.462 --> 01:03:40.782
<v Hou, Eric>Freddy.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7867-0
01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:44.345
<v Fei Li>Yeah,
definitely will have some impact because</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7867-1
01:03:44.345 --> 01:03:49.646
<v Fei Li>you see if you hear from the news that's
covered in Matthew, John Hopkins,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7856-0
01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:49.682
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7867-2
01:03:49.646 --> 01:03:54.382
<v Fei Li>you will even they have a billion dollars
from federal government.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7881-0
01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:59.129
<v Fei Li>They're battling with that as well. Today,
Harvard decides to sue the federal</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7881-1
01:03:59.129 --> 01:04:01.422
<v Fei Li>government regarding that decision. So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7887-0
01:04:02.152 --> 01:04:03.752
<v Fei Li>It's going to have some impact on us as
well.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7922-0
01:04:04.782 --> 01:04:09.054
<v Fei Li>Back to the question about investments
investment, I think everyone knows,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7922-1
01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:12.585
<v Fei Li>as I mentioned earlier,
you want to find the category winner,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7922-2
01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:17.142
<v Fei Li>which is like place you on the top tier,
right in terms of in terms of startup.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7915-0
01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:15.572
<v Hou, Eric>Hmm.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7948-0
01:04:17.182 --> 01:04:22.681
<v Fei Li>So once you catch one of those category
winner and put the heavy bets there and</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7948-1
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:26.186
<v Fei Li>no matter what's the rest of the fund
performance,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7948-2
01:04:26.186 --> 01:04:29.622
<v Fei Li>at least you know you will return the
whole fund.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7957-0
01:04:30.472 --> 01:04:33.912
<v Fei Li>That's kind of how venture investing
works. You better one investment.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7980-0
01:04:34.142 --> 01:04:40.893
<v Fei Li>And how will give you like a hockey stick,
time to return and will give you one</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7980-1
01:04:40.893 --> 01:04:45.702
<v Fei Li>investment will be enough to make your
life much better.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/7984-0
01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:48.522
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8005-0
01:04:48.522 --> 01:04:53.561
<v Hou, Eric>So I guess one last question for Maya and
I we sorry for you know we we your time</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8005-1

<v Hou, Eric>and maybe one last question.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8017-0
01:04:55.282 --> 01:04:58.674
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you do have, you know,
sufficient fund,</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8017-1

<v Hou, Eric>And what is the number one area?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8035-0
01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:10.592
<v Hou, Eric>That you would invest that having that
having AI involved?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8037-0
01:05:11.822 --> 01:05:12.342
<v Fei Li>So.</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8052-0

01:05:18.942 --> 01:05:23.532
<v Fei Li>So I think another area where we invest
is AI for healthcare, right?</v>

12614fe8-2970-4eb6-98c9-1d4f4214d877/8063-0
01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:22.772
