<v Sam Iosevich>Alright, so as we get,
let's just jump right in.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/75-0
00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:24.687
<v Sam Iosevich>Just a very brief introduction.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/100-0
00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:30.642
<v Sam Iosevich>Not gonna speak a lot about myself,
but I'll give you in a kind of an ID and</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/100-1
00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.847
<v Sam Iosevich>overview of what Parker Avery Avery is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/116-0
00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:37.629
<v Sam Iosevich>So in terms of myself,
I've been in the space for, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/116-1
00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.607
<v Sam Iosevich>just, you know, in terms of analytics.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/122-0
00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.047
<v Sam Iosevich>And really it's for me.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/126-0
00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.847
<v Sam Iosevich>It's been 30 years, close to 30 years.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/142-0
00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:52.225
<v Sam Iosevich>Now and it's been, you know,
my concentration that whole time has been</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/142-1
00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.517
<v Sam Iosevich>in demand analytics, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/183-0
00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:59.201
<v Sam Iosevich>So we're talking about, you know,
retail analytics for and mostly</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/183-1
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:04.737
<v Sam Iosevich>forecasting. And I would say pricing.
Those have been the the key focus areas</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/183-2
00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:08.782
<v Sam Iosevich>for, for myself,
you know the the companies that I would</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/183-3
00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Sam Iosevich>have started right and in the
organizations that,</v>

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:15.847
<v Sam Iosevich>So the systems that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/200-0
00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:20.082
<v Sam Iosevich>That that,
I and my colleagues have built have been</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/200-1
00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:20.877
<v Sam Iosevich>deployed at.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/208-0
00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:24.207
<v Sam Iosevich>Walmart's U.S. Foods.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/212-0

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/225-0
00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:32.354
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
Fortune 500 companies in in the US and</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/225-1

<v Sam Iosevich>and abroad as well.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/256-0
00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:38.207
<v Sam Iosevich>And then I I had to put in the last point
around dynamic aggregation,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/256-1
00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:42.293
<v Sam Iosevich>because this is actually Eric,
Eric and I and another gentleman,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/256-2
00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:47.007
<v Sam Iosevich>George actually have a have a paper out
in IEEE on on dynamic aggregation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/267-0
00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:53.717
<v Sam Iosevich>And Erica did a lot of work there and so
very thankful for that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/302-0
00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:58.224
<v Sam Iosevich>All right. So so let's just jump into,
you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/302-1
00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Sam Iosevich>just before we get into the AI aspects of
this,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/302-2
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.874
<v Sam Iosevich>I want you to understand the context,
right,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/302-3
00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.607
<v Sam Iosevich>that of of where I where I do my work
right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/312-0
00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:09.727
<v Sam Iosevich>So we do a lot of Parker Avery.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/321-0
00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:13.127
<v Sam Iosevich>We only concentrate on retail and
consumer goods. That's it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/334-0
00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:15.366
<v Sam Iosevich>We don't do healthcare,
financial services, none.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/334-1
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.247
<v Sam Iosevich>None of the others, none of none of those.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/341-0
00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:18.797
<v Sam Iosevich>Other things, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/348-0
00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:22.917
<v Sam Iosevich>So so when I talk about AI, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/377-0
00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:29.489
<v Sam Iosevich>It's only as I through the lens of as I
see it in in those in those industries,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/377-1
00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.486
<v Sam Iosevich>right and really within those industries
we we focus a lot on, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/377-2
00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:38.197
<v Sam Iosevich>like I said, forecasting pricing.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/391-0
00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:44.442
<v Sam Iosevich>Inventory inventory management is is a
big part of what we do assortment</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/391-1
00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:45.927
<v Sam Iosevich>planning and and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/393-0
00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:46.687
<v Sam Iosevich>But if you'd say.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/420-0
00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:51.418
<v Sam Iosevich>If there is a focus on one area,
if you have to describe it on one word,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/420-1
00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:53.557
<v Sam Iosevich>it is it is inventory, right it is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/447-0
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:59.363
<v Sam Iosevich>You know how? How you, how you plan it,
how you you know how you price it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/447-1
00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:02.941
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
how you how you allocate it and and and</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/447-2
00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:04.157
<v Sam Iosevich>and so on, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/457-0
00:03:05.647 --> 00:03:07.047
<v Sam Iosevich>So analytics is advanced.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/470-0
00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Sam Iosevich>Analytics is is one is one piece.
One piece of this,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/470-1
00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:16.127
<v Sam Iosevich>but a big part of what we also do is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/486-0
00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:21.414
<v Sam Iosevich>Business process design,
organizational design,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/486-1
00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:24.517
<v Sam Iosevich>change management and so on, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/494-0
00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:27.917
<v Sam Iosevich>So this these are sort of our
capabilities.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/500-0
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:32.003
<v Sam Iosevich>Again, not a sales pitch,
just having you understand what is it</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/500-1
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:32.677

<v Sam Iosevich>In terms of the, you know, so,
so the companies that that, that,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/535-1

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/535-2
00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:46.823
<v Sam Iosevich>landscape mean this is not this is not
exhaustive but you know there's again the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/535-3
00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:48.087
<v Sam Iosevich>Walmarts use foods the.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/537-0

<v Sam Iosevich>Michelins.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/577-0

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:59.649
<v Sam Iosevich>So we work with department stores as well
as some of the Cpg's like, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/577-2

<v Sam Iosevich>and so on. OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/608-0
00:04:08.077 --> 00:04:11.513
<v Sam Iosevich>All right, now, so,
so when we talk about again,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/608-1
00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:16.280
<v Sam Iosevich>we're going to get into AI.
And I think the slide basically what we</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/608-2
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.837
<v Sam Iosevich>just wanted to just just reiterate
analytics for analytics sake.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/617-0
00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:24.157
<v Sam Iosevich>Well, you're all in Business School.

<v Sam Iosevich>Is is worthless, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/636-0
00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:31.447
<v Sam Iosevich>So what you really need to you know,
you really need to understand the you</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/636-1

<v Sam Iosevich>know, so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/645-0

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/646-0
00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:36.127
<v Sam Iosevich>So so we.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/650-0

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:48.007
<v Sam Iosevich>Change. We're really talking about, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/678-0
00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.087
<v Sam Iosevich>A communication plan, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/712-0
00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:52.594
<v Sam Iosevich>So when when you,
when you implement anything,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/712-1
00:04:52.594 --> 00:04:56.861
<v Sam Iosevich>you have to make sure that of course the
people are bought in that you have the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/712-2
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.421
<v Sam Iosevich>proper training in place to bring people
along,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/712-3
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:02.407
<v Sam Iosevich>you have to think about things like
sustainment, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/724-0
00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:04.108
<v Sam Iosevich>Right.
So when you walk out of the building or</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/724-1
00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.917
<v Sam Iosevich>you're done or you don't walk out of the
building, let's say this is internal.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/752-0
00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:11.914
<v Sam Iosevich>What is the plan for sustainment of of,
you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/752-1
00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:16.824
<v Sam Iosevich>of whatever it is that you're
implementing when you're done with with</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/752-2
00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.647
<v Sam Iosevich>the implementation, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/768-0
00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:22.381
<v Sam Iosevich>So this is the lens that, that, that,
that,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/768-1
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:28.407
<v Sam Iosevich>that we that we you know looking through
when when doing our work, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/807-0
00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Sam Iosevich>All right. So with that,
we're now ready to jump into the focus of</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/807-1
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.523
<v Sam Iosevich>all of this and that is about, you know,
achieving ROI within within AI, OK,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/807-2
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:46.996
<v Sam Iosevich>so and then we'll talk about the two core
value areas, right to make it very simple.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/807-3
00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:48.367
<v Sam Iosevich>You know in terms.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/815-0
00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:50.717
<v Sam Iosevich>Of how how I personally see.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/828-0
00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:55.199
<v Sam Iosevich>AI in in retail,
so next slide will be a little bit</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/828-1
00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.407
<v Sam Iosevich>controversial, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/840-0
00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:59.145
<v Sam Iosevich>It is with with some folks,
but it is something that I strongly</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/840-1
00:05:59.145 --> 00:05:59.487
<v Sam Iosevich>believe.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/892-0
00:05:59.837 --> 00:06:05.992
<v Sam Iosevich>Even not only because of what I just,
not because of what I've read,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/892-1
00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:12.682
<v Sam Iosevich>but just experienced right in terms of
the research and development within</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/892-2
00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:15.893
<v Sam Iosevich>Parker,
Avery and also implementing</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/892-3
00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:22.315
<v Sam Iosevich>implementations at multiple companies
from from mid size to Fortune 500</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/892-4
00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:25.437
<v Sam Iosevich>companies in the US and abroad, so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/895-0
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.277
<v Sam Iosevich>With that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/939-0
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Sam Iosevich>Basically, you know,
if I have to say you know the key right</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/939-1
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.547
<v Sam Iosevich>to getting to ROI with with AI is to
focus on augmentation and not complete</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/939-2
00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:43.892
<v Sam Iosevich>automation, OK?
And this is where people wait a second,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/939-3
00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:44.357
<v Sam Iosevich>right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/958-0
00:06:44.357 --> 00:06:49.371
<v Sam Iosevich>Many actually take a step back and say,
wait a second when we hear about AI,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/958-1
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:53.277
<v Sam Iosevich>it's it's really about,
I thought it's about the, you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/963-0
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:54.967
<v Sam Iosevich>Automation. What is this?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/964-0
00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:55.727
<v Sam Iosevich>What is this?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/969-0
00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:57.487
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, all, all all about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/979-0
00:06:57.837 --> 00:07:01.277
<v Sam Iosevich>Right. And so,
so I've got two quotes here.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1021-0
00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:06.094
<v Sam Iosevich>And we'll we'll, you know,
we'll talk about this.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1021-1
00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:10.630
<v Sam Iosevich>One is from myself to, you know,
in the recap to the Advisory Board,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1021-2
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.363
<v Sam Iosevich>the Parker Avery Advisory Board and a
quote from Andrew Eng. So if you,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1021-3
00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:19.767
<v Sam Iosevich>if you would have, you know,
done any you know research or follow.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1043-0
00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:24.214
<v Sam Iosevich>One in in AI you're you're going.
Probably Andrew is one of the one of the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1043-1
00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:28.327
<v Sam Iosevich>people that you would be would be
following in this in this business, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1071-0
00:07:28.597 --> 00:07:31.366
<v Sam Iosevich>So.
So basically what I what I said to the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1071-1
00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:36.452
<v Sam Iosevich>Advisory Board is we want to avoid the
false economy of requiring near perfect</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1071-2
00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:37.997
<v Sam Iosevich>accuracy for automation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1079-0
00:07:37.997 --> 00:07:43.557
<v Sam Iosevich>The problem with automation is that you
have to make sure that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1086-0
00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:47.407
<v Sam Iosevich>Your that the application right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1091-0
00:07:47.407 --> 00:07:49.847
<v Sam Iosevich>The AI does not do anything anything
stupid.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1101-0
00:07:49.847 --> 00:07:53.847
<v Sam Iosevich>I mean, you know,
and so I'll give you a real world example.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1112-0
00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Sam Iosevich>OK.
So for us we you know we replace and this</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1112-1
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:58.727
<v Sam Iosevich>is multiple years ago.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1155-0
00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:02.795
<v Sam Iosevich>In a department store where we replace
the,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1155-1
00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Sam Iosevich>you know we put a replenishment system in
place which actually did ended up in an</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1155-2
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.917
<v Sam Iosevich>automated order, right.
And then shipment to the stores and we</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1155-3
00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:21.103
<v Sam Iosevich>showed that in terms of you know,
we had much better accuracies and lower</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1155-4
00:08:21.103 --> 00:08:21.437
<v Sam Iosevich>buy.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1163-0
00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:24.237
<v Sam Iosevich>You know the the bias was near near 0.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1172-0
00:08:25.007 --> 00:08:26.887
<v Sam Iosevich>High stability and so on and so forth,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1177-0
00:08:26.887 --> 00:08:30.367
<v Sam Iosevich>But you're talking about thousands and
10s of thousands.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1206-0
00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:36.813
<v Sam Iosevich>Of orders that go out right? So.
So there was a case where we ordered a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1206-1
00:08:36.813 --> 00:08:43.103
<v Sam Iosevich>truckload worth of pillows that actually
made their way to a South Carolina store,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1206-2
00:08:43.103 --> 00:08:43.557
<v Sam Iosevich>right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1220-0
00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:49.388
<v Sam Iosevich>And so 99.9% of the time, you know,
the the system, the system works,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1220-1
00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:50.637
<v Sam Iosevich>it works great.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1233-0
00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:56.917
<v Sam Iosevich>But if you take all of the kind of the
the barriers right that that the safety.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1242-0
00:08:57.607 --> 00:09:01.302
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
constraints out you can run into some</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1242-1
00:09:01.302 --> 00:09:01.687
<v Sam Iosevich>some.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1246-0
00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:02.997
<v Sam Iosevich>Serious problem.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1265-0
00:09:02.997 --> 00:09:08.091
<v Sam Iosevich>So what winds up happening is if you
shoot for complete automation,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1265-1
00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:11.837
<v Sam Iosevich>this is where you really get into trouble,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1272-0
00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:14.957
<v Sam Iosevich>And the idea is that is the goal, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1290-0
00:09:14.997 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Sam Iosevich>Eventually you want to get there,
and then what you do is you shoot for</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1290-1
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.477
<v Sam Iosevich>four for augmentation, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1294-0
00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:25.477
<v Sam Iosevich>And then more augmentation over time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1301-0
00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:27.317
<v Sam Iosevich>Do you ever get to complete automation?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1307-0
00:09:27.357 --> 00:09:29.917
<v Sam Iosevich>Maybe, maybe not right, but that's that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1311-0
00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:31.757
<v Sam Iosevich>But but if you want to get to ROI.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1330-0
00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:36.317
<v Sam Iosevich>Quickly augmentation should be goal and
not a not complete automation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1344-0
00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:43.240
<v Sam Iosevich>And actually Andrew Enggs quote right
there I think is very is very supportive</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1344-1
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.157
<v Sam Iosevich>of that concept as as.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1370-0
00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:51.104
<v Sam Iosevich>Now,
if and and by the way the you know</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1370-1
00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Sam Iosevich>another another great example I I think
is look,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1370-2
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.736
<v Sam Iosevich>we've implemented a large language model,
you know for in, in our,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1370-3
00:09:59.736 --> 00:10:01.447
<v Sam Iosevich>in our demand planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1390-0
00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:08.037
<v Sam Iosevich>Capability where basically we have with
the user can come in and ask the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1390-1
00:10:08.037 --> 00:10:10.277
<v Sam Iosevich>application questions around.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1431-0
00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:16.814
<v Sam Iosevich>A number of things could ask it to
perform analysis and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1431-1
00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:20.661
<v Sam Iosevich>If the application if we call,
ask the hypercube,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1431-2
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Sam Iosevich>right our application build and the large
language model right gives you a proper</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1431-3
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.047
<v Sam Iosevich>result even 90% of the time it is
extremely helpful.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1437-0
00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:32.477
<v Sam Iosevich>Right we can.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1448-0
00:10:32.477 --> 00:10:37.477
<v Sam Iosevich>We can sit there and we can actually try
to get it to 99.9% accurate.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1481-0
00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:42.294
<v Sam Iosevich>And and we can spend another six months
or nine months,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1481-1
00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:46.868
<v Sam Iosevich>nine months doing something like that
versus getting something that would be</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1481-2
00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:50.967
<v Sam Iosevich>extremely useful out out into the out
into the into, into the field.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1483-0
00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:52.927
<v Sam Iosevich>OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1497-0
00:10:53.397 --> 00:11:01.237
<v Sam Iosevich>Alright, so and then. OK. So with that,
let me move on, let me move on to what.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1503-0
00:11:01.397 --> 00:11:04.037
<v Sam Iosevich>The two core value areas are right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1522-0
00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:09.104
<v Sam Iosevich>So when we talk about AI right,
it seems like it's a very lofty, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1522-1
00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:10.117
<v Sam Iosevich>concept, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1531-0
00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:13.117
<v Sam Iosevich>Let's just make it very just very easy.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1541-0
00:11:13.157 --> 00:11:19.597
<v Sam Iosevich>There's two real there's two things that
you use AI in retail for, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1546-0
00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:22.077
<v Sam Iosevich>You're either improving efficiency or.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1553-0
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.407
<v Sam Iosevich>It's used for the purposes of decision
making.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1555-0
00:11:24.757 --> 00:11:25.317
<v Sam Iosevich>That's it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1561-0
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.327
<v Sam Iosevich>Right, those those are the real use cases.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1567-0
00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:32.967
<v Sam Iosevich>And you know, I'm happy to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1586-0
00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:38.159
<v Sam Iosevich>Happy to discuss if you know if you all
don't agree. Happy, happy to discuss that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1586-1
00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:41.287
<v Sam Iosevich>But and we'll look at at examples thereof,
right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1602-0
00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:48.028
<v Sam Iosevich>And really dive into the decision making
part because that's that's really what</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1602-1
00:11:48.028 --> 00:11:48.927
<v Sam Iosevich>what we do.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1606-0
00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:53.887
<v Sam Iosevich>That's really where we spend a lot of
time, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1619-0
00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:59.357
<v Sam Iosevich>So efficiency, you know, faster, cheaper,
more consistent, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1625-0
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:03.437
<v Sam Iosevich>You're automating repetitive repetitive
tasks.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1677-0
00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:09.942
<v Sam Iosevich>And there is no shortage of those tasks
right in in, in retail today,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1677-1
00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:15.771
<v Sam Iosevich>if you look at anything from, you know,
any functional area which you see in FBA,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1677-2
00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:21.314
<v Sam Iosevich>you know just in terms of the weekly
reports which you do in open to buy what</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1677-3
00:12:21.314 --> 00:12:22.167
<v Sam Iosevich>you have in.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1679-0
00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:23.447
<v Sam Iosevich>You know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1686-0
00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:25.077
<v Sam Iosevich>Replenishment allocation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1701-0
00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.699
<v Sam Iosevich>There's a lot of things that are just
that,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1701-1
00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:30.797
<v Sam Iosevich>that that can be that that can be
automated, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1728-0
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:35.782
<v Sam Iosevich>You need to make sure that you have
guardrails associated with those as we</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1728-1
00:12:35.782 --> 00:12:38.814
<v Sam Iosevich>spoke about,
but there's no shortage of those</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1728-2
00:12:38.814 --> 00:12:41.517
<v Sam Iosevich>repetitive tasks right to be streamlined.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1756-0
00:12:41.837 --> 00:12:46.659
<v Sam Iosevich>You know there there's some examples
around customer service. You know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1756-1
00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:51.548
<v Sam Iosevich>look is there's no reason for human being
to actually answer the answer.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1756-2
00:12:51.548 --> 00:12:53.557
<v Sam Iosevich>The question of what are your.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1762-0
00:12:53.797 --> 00:12:54.797
<v Sam Iosevich>What are your hours?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1780-0
00:12:54.797 --> 00:13:00.161
<v Sam Iosevich>Right. What you know are, you know,
are you going to be closed for Memorial</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1780-1
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:05.877
<v Sam Iosevich>Day things and things of that nature?
Right. That's that can now be easily done.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1813-0
00:13:07.447 --> 00:13:11.346
<v Sam Iosevich>And then and then the the other use case
is really on on,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1813-1
00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:15.245
<v Sam Iosevich>on decision decision making in decision
making. You know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1813-2
00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:19.748
<v Sam Iosevich>we'll talk about we'll talk about some of
this. But you know what?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1813-3
00:13:19.748 --> 00:13:23.647
<v Sam Iosevich>What is my what is my best price?
How how much inventory?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1824-0
00:13:23.957 --> 00:13:27.197
<v Sam Iosevich>Do I need to have in a particular place?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1855-0
00:13:27.197 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Sam Iosevich>Well, you could say, well, wait a second,
I already, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1855-1
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.090
<v Sam Iosevich>are you just talking about basic
forecasting and and things like price,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1855-2
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.896
<v Sam Iosevich>you know, things like price optimization.
Well,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1855-3
00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:40.877
<v Sam Iosevich>it's it's it's a little bit more than
that, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1876-0
00:13:40.877 --> 00:13:44.928
<v Sam Iosevich>So it's it's yes,
that's that's augmentation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1876-1
00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:51.357
<v Sam Iosevich>But with AI we take that to a very,
very different very different level.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1897-0
00:13:51.637 --> 00:13:57.039
<v Sam Iosevich>OK. And and in time actually,
you know our our the use case,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1897-1
00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:03.237
<v Sam Iosevich>I mean the that we'll talk about is
really the collaboration between.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1911-0
00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:09.086
<v Sam Iosevich>Different functions and how AI actually
makes it a lot more, more, more efficient,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1911-1
00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:09.407
<v Sam Iosevich>right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1924-0
00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:14.596
<v Sam Iosevich>And this is this is this is something
that we have implemented in multiple the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1924-1
00:14:14.596 --> 00:14:15.647
<v Sam Iosevich>multiple places.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1930-0
00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.007
<v Sam Iosevich>So, so. So we'll get into that, all right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1938-0
00:14:18.247 --> 00:14:21.487
<v Sam Iosevich>But first,
let's just talk about the efficiency.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1940-0
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:21.847
<v Sam Iosevich>I want to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1953-0
00:14:22.317 --> 00:14:26.525
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, it's not a case study,
but it's it's just a focused example,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1953-1
00:14:26.525 --> 00:14:27.117
<v Sam Iosevich>right? So.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1966-0
00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:33.967
<v Sam Iosevich>And and and and. By the way,
I have no stock position in Hulu.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1973-0
00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:35.794
<v Sam Iosevich>Actually,
they're they're they're they're not a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1973-1
00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:37.087
<v Sam Iosevich>public company, a private company.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/1983-0
00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:39.647
<v Sam Iosevich>But anyway,
I have no shares in that company.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2002-0
00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:43.471
<v Sam Iosevich>I I do know the the the CEO,
but look it's.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2002-1
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:49.207
<v Sam Iosevich>But I really like to this particular use
case for for efficiency.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2010-0
00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:52.007
<v Sam Iosevich>So I wanted to to bring that up.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2039-0
00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:57.663
<v Sam Iosevich>Right. So so when you're talking about,
you know getting ROI in, in,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2039-1
00:14:57.663 --> 00:15:02.234
<v Sam Iosevich>in retail and you're talking about the
efficiency example,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2039-2
00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:07.037
<v Sam Iosevich>Hulu I think is is a great is a great
example of that, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2066-0
00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:12.210
<v Sam Iosevich>So many of the things that they automate,
their other companies that that do.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2066-1
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:17.443
<v Sam Iosevich>So if we're talking about robotic process
automation or software test software,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2066-2
00:15:17.443 --> 00:15:18.947
<v Sam Iosevich>test automation, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2082-0
00:15:18.947 --> 00:15:23.878
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, and some of these other things,
there are other companies that that</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2082-1
00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:26.027
<v Sam Iosevich>actually do that actually do that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2090-0
00:15:26.027 --> 00:15:31.307
<v Sam Iosevich>For example, software test automation.
By the way, we have improved.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2093-0
00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:32.717
<v Sam Iosevich>Our software.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2099-0
00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:35.997
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, software process, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2144-0
00:15:36.067 --> 00:15:40.466
<v Sam Iosevich>Right by automating by automating testing
in that you know by the way,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2144-1
00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:45.547
<v Sam Iosevich>we're constantly adding functionality,
for example into our demand planning tool.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2157-0
00:15:45.697 --> 00:15:48.894
<v Sam Iosevich>Yeah, and.
And oftentimes when you add functionality,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2157-1
00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:50.137
<v Sam Iosevich>you wind up breaking.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2195-0
00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:53.346
<v Sam Iosevich>You wind up breaking things that actually
worked before,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2195-1
00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:57.794
<v Sam Iosevich>so there's no reason why you need to have
a tester actually go through and hit</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2195-2
00:15:57.794 --> 00:16:01.228
<v Sam Iosevich>those buttons to make sure you didn't
break anything. Right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2195-3
00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:05.619
<v Sam Iosevich>Nowadays you can actually have automated
very much automated software testing</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2195-4
00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:06.857
<v Sam Iosevich>tools, which we'll go.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2204-0
00:16:06.857 --> 00:16:10.817
<v Sam Iosevich>Through and and make you know just very
quickly tell you.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2210-0
00:16:11.587 --> 00:16:12.667
<v Sam Iosevich>Did you break anything?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2213-0
00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:13.507
<v Sam Iosevich>Where did you break it?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2215-0
00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:14.947
<v Sam Iosevich>And so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2222-0
00:16:16.177 --> 00:16:17.297
<v Sam Iosevich>But but they go.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2226-0
00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:20.177
<v Sam Iosevich>They go once but, but where they go?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2236-0
00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:25.547
<v Sam Iosevich>I they go one step further and and I
think I think it's.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2251-0
00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:31.787
<v Sam Iosevich>I think it's it's it's the next level of
of efficiency.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2258-0
00:16:31.787 --> 00:16:35.267
<v Sam Iosevich>What they will do is they will monitor
your your processes.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2270-0
00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:39.107
<v Sam Iosevich>They will monitor, you know,
the way that you work.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2282-0
00:16:39.107 --> 00:16:44.987
<v Sam Iosevich>So if you're a replenishment analyst or
you're a you work in merchant.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2286-0
00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:46.217
<v Sam Iosevich>Financial planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2325-0
00:16:46.257 --> 00:16:50.871
<v Sam Iosevich>But basically,
a Hulu will monitor what tasks you go</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2325-1
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:56.442
<v Sam Iosevich>through on a daily basis,
OK and what they will then do is they</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2325-2
00:16:56.442 --> 00:17:03.406
<v Sam Iosevich>will suggest places for for automation,
OK and then actually not only will they</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2325-3
00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:06.017
<v Sam Iosevich>suggest places for automation.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2337-0
00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:12.547
<v Sam Iosevich>They will actually help you with to
automate those particular tasks.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2357-0
00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:19.926
<v Sam Iosevich>In the number of tasks that are automated
actually increase increase over over time,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2357-1
00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:20.377
<v Sam Iosevich>right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2363-0
00:17:20.937 --> 00:17:24.217
<v Sam Iosevich>So it's a continuous improvement loop,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2377-0
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:27.137
<v Sam Iosevich>This gets to the idea of not full
automation, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2385-0
00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:33.539
<v Sam Iosevich>You're its augmentation,
but it's increased augmentation over over</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2385-1
00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:34.017
<v Sam Iosevich>time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2398-0
00:17:35.627 --> 00:17:38.118
<v Sam Iosevich>OK,
the this I actually this is the first</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2398-1
00:17:38.118 --> 00:17:42.507
<v Sam Iosevich>time that that I saw that and I thought
yeah, this is this is definitely.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2422-0
00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:48.003
<v Sam Iosevich>Moving in the in the right direction from
an from a AI in a,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2422-1
00:17:48.003 --> 00:17:52.737
<v Sam Iosevich>you know inefficiency improvement side of
the house, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2428-0
00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:56.137
<v Sam Iosevich>So anyway,
you guys may want to check that out.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2440-0
00:17:56.137 --> 00:18:01.617
<v Sam Iosevich>There's there's of course many examples
of of efficiency plays in this field.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2452-0
00:18:01.897 --> 00:18:05.472
<v Sam Iosevich>There's a, you know, for example,
this company called Deepao,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2452-1
00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:06.337
<v Sam Iosevich>which actually.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2465-0
00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Sam Iosevich>Creates, you know,
if you wanted to create these multimodal</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2465-1
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.147
<v Sam Iosevich>AI to for example.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2481-0
00:18:13.497 --> 00:18:17.337
<v Sam Iosevich>To create standard operating procedures,
right? So so you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2481-1
00:18:17.337 --> 00:18:18.537
<v Sam Iosevich>if you can actually.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2520-0
00:18:19.987 --> 00:18:25.118
<v Sam Iosevich>You can actually tape yourself performing
certain tasks and they they can</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2520-1
00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:29.902
<v Sam Iosevich>understand what's happening. You know,
in the video plus the speech.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2520-2
00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:34.547
<v Sam Iosevich>And it will actually write a standard
operating procedure for you.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2534-0
00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:39.643
<v Sam Iosevich>Something that used to take, you know,
you know, weeks can now be done in, in,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2534-1
00:18:39.643 --> 00:18:40.667
<v Sam Iosevich>in hours, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2539-0
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:42.107
<v Sam Iosevich>Of course, you're going to go through.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2547-0
00:18:42.107 --> 00:18:44.547
<v Sam Iosevich>You're going to check there's going to be
places where it's not.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2568-0
00:18:44.977 --> 00:18:48.977
<v Sam Iosevich>Where it's not perfect. Again, that's,
you know, it's not full automation,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2568-1
00:18:48.977 --> 00:18:52.177
<v Sam Iosevich>but it's a heck of a lot of, you know,
augmentation, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2577-0
00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.187
<v Sam Iosevich>Which certainly makes you more and more
efficient. OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2586-0
00:19:00.217 --> 00:19:03.857
<v Sam Iosevich>So. So with that, I want to now move to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2610-0
00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:09.471
<v Sam Iosevich>To the decision,
a decision making focused example,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2610-1
00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:15.707
<v Sam Iosevich>that's what I believe is the second core
core value for for AI in in, in retail.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2624-0
00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:18.756
<v Sam Iosevich>All right, so let's let's,
let's talk about, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2624-1
00:19:18.756 --> 00:19:20.267
<v Sam Iosevich>this is a specific use case.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2637-0
00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:25.112
<v Sam Iosevich>Why that that we've that we get involved
with and this is this is going to be</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2637-1
00:19:25.112 --> 00:19:25.547
<v Sam Iosevich>around.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2643-0
00:19:27.227 --> 00:19:29.707
<v Sam Iosevich>What I call a unified what I call a
unified.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2649-0
00:19:30.057 --> 00:19:33.017
<v Sam Iosevich>Demand signal all right and so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2655-0
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:37.427
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
here's a here's a situation where.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2664-0
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:42.147
<v Sam Iosevich>You have multiple demand signals.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2665-0
00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.267
<v Sam Iosevich>Call them.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2686-0
00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:46.466
<v Sam Iosevich>Call them forecasts.
I call them demand signals because it's</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2686-1
00:19:46.466 --> 00:19:50.347
<v Sam Iosevich>it's actually not only because sometimes
it's not a statistical forecast.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2701-0
00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:55.843
<v Sam Iosevich>Sometimes it is a human projection,
sometimes they will include levers for</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2701-1
00:19:55.843 --> 00:19:59.067
<v Sam Iosevich>things like pricing or or external
factors.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2709-0
00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:01.537
<v Sam Iosevich>Like consumer sentiment and so on and so
forth.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-0
00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:06.937
<v Sam Iosevich>So if you look across finance,
merchandising, marketing, operations,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-1
00:20:06.937 --> 00:20:10.407
<v Sam Iosevich>planning, pricing,
supply chain fulfillment,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-2
00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:14.416
<v Sam Iosevich>they will all have different demand
demand signals.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-3
00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:18.657
<v Sam Iosevich>And usually they'll have a multitude of
forecasts, OK?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-4
00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:24.362
<v Sam Iosevich>And So what winds up happening is think
about what would happen in a in a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2757-5
00:20:24.362 --> 00:20:25.827
<v Sam Iosevich>situation you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2768-0
00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:28.577
<v Sam Iosevich>And we've all seen this in the store and
I, you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2799-0
00:20:29.297 --> 00:20:32.511
<v Sam Iosevich>So let's say your your local grocery
store.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2799-1

<v Sam Iosevich>They promote a particular a particular
product come in and you know we're going</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2799-2
00:20:38.353 --> 00:20:42.297
<v Sam Iosevich>to have a, you know,
24 pack of Pepsi on sale, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2802-0
00:20:42.297 --> 00:20:43.937
<v Sam Iosevich>It's we're going to run a BOGO.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2825-0
00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:49.184
<v Sam Iosevich>You come into the store and the shelf is
the shelf is empty,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2825-1
00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:54.817

<v Sam Iosevich>But you know what?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2838-0
00:20:57.027 --> 00:20:59.347
<v Sam Iosevich>There's just not enough.
Not enough people.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2840-0
00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:00.297

<v Sam Iosevich>Assistance, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2862-0
00:21:08.707 --> 00:21:10.827
<v Sam Iosevich>How does that again?
How does that that happen?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2897-0
00:21:10.867 --> 00:21:15.603
<v Sam Iosevich>Is that you know the planning that the
merchandise planning is done with one</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2897-1
00:21:15.603 --> 00:21:18.432
<v Sam Iosevich>system,
the promotional planning is done with</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2897-2
00:21:18.432 --> 00:21:23.414
<v Sam Iosevich>with with another system to store labor
is done with with a third and by the way</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2897-3
00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:27.227
<v Sam Iosevich>in terms of their demand there's there's
no match whatsoever.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2925-0
00:21:27.737 --> 00:21:32.618
<v Sam Iosevich>OK, so so to address this issue,
you probably heard of something called as</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2925-1
00:21:32.618 --> 00:21:36.457
<v Sam Iosevich>an snop process or or integrated business
planning, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2956-0
00:21:36.497 --> 00:21:41.970
<v Sam Iosevich>Those are kind of things that have been
put in place by companies to deal with</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2956-1
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.512
<v Sam Iosevich>this particular this particular issue, OK,
and this is a non non AI approach to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2956-2
00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:48.897
<v Sam Iosevich>solving the problem.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2962-0
00:21:48.937 --> 00:21:53.097
<v Sam Iosevich>So what happens is in sales and
operations planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/2975-0
00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:57.947
<v Sam Iosevich>You you have a a,
you you come up with an understanding.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3001-0
00:21:58.337 --> 00:22:03.665
<v Sam Iosevich>What your demand plan is about once a
month and it's some added some aggregate</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3001-1
00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:07.577
<v Sam Iosevich>level that may or may not work for all of
your functions.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3002-0
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.137
<v Sam Iosevich>Oh, and by the way.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3046-0
00:22:10.587 --> 00:22:15.651
<v Sam Iosevich>It it'll it'll be based on the metric
again that that may or may not work for</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3046-1
00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:20.520
<v Sam Iosevich>for the function that you're in.
For example, if you could be forecasting,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3046-2
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.832
<v Sam Iosevich>normally it's a projection of dollars or
or units,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3046-3
00:22:23.832 --> 00:22:27.467
<v Sam Iosevich>but in finance you know you're interested
in, you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3086-0
00:22:27.937 --> 00:22:32.374
<v Sam Iosevich>In margin and so on and so on and so
forth and in some,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3086-1
00:22:32.374 --> 00:22:36.018
<v Sam Iosevich>some are interested in the 2436 month
signal.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3086-2
00:22:36.018 --> 00:22:40.376
<v Sam Iosevich>Others are interested in a in a
three-week out signal.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3086-3
00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:44.337
<v Sam Iosevich>If if you're talking about fulfillment
and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3109-0
00:22:46.307 --> 00:22:50.467
<v Sam Iosevich>So again,
this is this kind of starts to align your</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3109-1
00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:57.027
<v Sam Iosevich>your your functions but and by the way
this is also done in a in a monthly level.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3122-0
00:22:57.417 --> 00:23:02.233
<v Sam Iosevich>Alright,
it aligns them to but but not but but not</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3122-1
00:23:02.233 --> 00:23:03.177
<v Sam Iosevich>really so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3139-0
00:23:03.177 --> 00:23:06.156
<v Sam Iosevich>And then you'll go through the process of
taking this demand signal across</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3139-1
00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:08.697
<v Sam Iosevich>different functions.
You'll take it to the executive committee.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3147-0
00:23:08.697 --> 00:23:14.137
<v Sam Iosevich>They'll sign off on it and then you start
to process again the next the next month.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3155-0
00:23:16.907 --> 00:23:19.147
<v Sam Iosevich>Well, the the opportunity here, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3172-0
00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:27.107
<v Sam Iosevich>And this is where we're getting into the
the augmentation is is a continuous cycle.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3186-0
00:23:27.787 --> 00:23:33.634
<v Sam Iosevich>By which actually you have one demand
signal which actually works its way</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3186-1
00:23:33.634 --> 00:23:34.187
<v Sam Iosevich>across.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3201-0
00:23:35.627 --> 00:23:40.107
<v Sam Iosevich>All the the Geo prod channel,
all of your hierarchies across time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3218-0
00:23:40.107 --> 00:23:43.899
<v Sam Iosevich>So so a telescopic signal,
different granularities of time,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3218-1
00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:46.427
<v Sam Iosevich>but then also different metrics as well.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3227-0
00:23:46.427 --> 00:23:52.187
<v Sam Iosevich>And self reconciling so that so that you
know, if you're talking about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3233-0
00:23:53.827 --> 00:23:54.547
<v Sam Iosevich>The supply chain.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3238-0
00:23:54.587 --> 00:23:57.587
<v Sam Iosevich>There you see DC slots.
If we're talking about operations.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3290-0
00:23:57.977 --> 00:24:01.395
<v Sam Iosevich>We're talking about labor hours.
If you're talking about finance,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3290-1
00:24:01.395 --> 00:24:04.762
<v Sam Iosevich>you're talking about dollars and gross,
you know, and, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3290-2
00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:07.714
<v Sam Iosevich>in terms of revenue.
And then you're talking about gross</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3290-3
00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.407
<v Sam Iosevich>margin and so on.
If you're talking about planning,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3290-4
00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:13.307
<v Sam Iosevich>you've got, you've got units.
So so regardless of what?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3315-0
00:24:13.307 --> 00:24:19.428
<v Sam Iosevich>Whatever function you're in and you know
you have your projection in the metric</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3315-1
00:24:19.428 --> 00:24:23.177
<v Sam Iosevich>that it's in now,
what do you do with with with?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3320-0
00:24:23.827 --> 00:24:25.027
<v Sam Iosevich>In each one of these areas.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3345-0
00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:29.077
<v Sam Iosevich>Right.
We'll have a set of levers that they can</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3345-1
00:24:29.077 --> 00:24:33.817
<v Sam Iosevich>pull which will affect the entire what we
call hypercube, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3354-0
00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:37.617
<v Sam Iosevich>So when pricing pulls the lever on a
particular promotion.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3356-0
00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:39.347
<v Sam Iosevich>That.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3386-0
00:24:40.907 --> 00:24:45.705
<v Sam Iosevich>That is seen in in manufacturing supply
chain operations in real time and then</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3386-1
00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:50.625
<v Sam Iosevich>you can see you know you know is there is
there a constraint so so for example I</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3386-2
00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:54.147
<v Sam Iosevich>can give you the the party city example
that I mean they.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3421-0
00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:59.448
<v Sam Iosevich>They're unfortunately,
they're they've they're no longer in</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3421-1
00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:03.681
<v Sam Iosevich>business, not due to us,
but so in in that particular example,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3421-2
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.712
<v Sam Iosevich>what we're doing, you know,
taking marks or or for markdown</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3421-3
00:25:07.712 --> 00:25:10.937
<v Sam Iosevich>optimization or we're changing changing
prices.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3426-0
00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:14.587
<v Sam Iosevich>We would suggest, for example, here's.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3471-0
00:25:14.587 --> 00:25:18.859
<v Sam Iosevich>Here's here's the price changes that need
to be made will,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3471-1
00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:23.711
<v Sam Iosevich>which will of course optimize the
following metrics. And you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3471-2
00:25:23.711 --> 00:25:27.403
<v Sam Iosevich>that's great. You know. However,
when it makes it,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3471-3
00:25:27.403 --> 00:25:32.544
<v Sam Iosevich>which means that by the way,
that you need to make a certain number of</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3471-4
00:25:32.544 --> 00:25:34.137
<v Sam Iosevich>changes per stores it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3488-0
00:25:34.137 --> 00:25:37.863
<v Sam Iosevich>Comes back to to operations say well,
wait a second.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3488-1
00:25:37.863 --> 00:25:41.097
<v Sam Iosevich>We don't have the labor to make all of
those.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3496-0
00:25:41.327 --> 00:25:42.447
<v Sam Iosevich>Those price changes, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3509-0
00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:48.927
<v Sam Iosevich>And that's seen there in, in, in real, in,
in, in real, in real time, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3549-0
00:25:49.727 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Sam Iosevich>And So what that allows you to do is
instead of waiting for the monthly</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3549-1
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.459
<v Sam Iosevich>process,
you can run all sorts of simulations and</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3549-2
00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:01.134
<v Sam Iosevich>see how you know.
You know that gave you a scenario here.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3549-3
00:26:01.134 --> 00:26:05.697
<v Sam Iosevich>Let's say you're executing a Bogo,
buy one, get one free and that that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3556-0
00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:07.807
<v Sam Iosevich>Would mean a 3.6 X.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3562-0
00:26:08.537 --> 00:26:10.377
<v Sam Iosevich>Increase in in units, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3581-0
00:26:10.807 --> 00:26:14.545
<v Sam Iosevich>So.
So then you get to see what are your</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3581-1
00:26:14.545 --> 00:26:20.287
<v Sam Iosevich>implications across all of your all of
the business functions?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3590-0
00:26:21.857 --> 00:26:24.737
<v Sam Iosevich>At at the same at the same time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3605-0
00:26:24.977 --> 00:26:29.152
<v Sam Iosevich>Now,
if you if you have that capability right,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3605-1
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:31.017
<v Sam Iosevich>this sets you up for.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3619-0
00:26:32.697 --> 00:26:37.577
<v Sam Iosevich>Something that will talk about, which is,
you know, you can then ask.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3623-0
00:26:37.737 --> 00:26:40.257
<v Sam Iosevich>You can then ask AI you know through.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3627-0
00:26:40.847 --> 00:26:41.887
<v Sam Iosevich>AI to run.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3660-0
00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:48.806
<v Sam Iosevich>Through our agentic AI model to start
running scenarios which actually address</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3660-1
00:26:48.806 --> 00:26:53.734
<v Sam Iosevich>certain business challenges and we'll get
into that in our when we talk about the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3660-2
00:26:53.734 --> 00:26:55.417
<v Sam Iosevich>AI sophistication curve, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3668-0
00:26:57.617 --> 00:26:59.257
<v Sam Iosevich>But for the most part, guys are you.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3671-0
00:26:59.257 --> 00:27:00.417
<v Sam Iosevich>Are you with me, Eric?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3676-0
00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:03.337
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, I'm going to all good.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3691-0
00:27:04.347 --> 00:27:06.627
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I I am definitely enjoying this.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3678-0
00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:05.017
<v Sam Iosevich>Good.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3694-0
00:27:07.547 --> 00:27:09.387
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully the students love it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3698-0
00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:09.887
<v Sam Iosevich>Yeah.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3707-0
00:27:09.387 --> 00:27:12.187
<v Hou, Eric>I I think there's a lot of information
and definitely it is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3716-0
00:27:13.307 --> 00:27:16.147
<v Hou, Eric>It's a good, good, very good presentation,
very informative.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3719-0
00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:17.867
<v Sam Iosevich>No, no, that's fine.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3733-0
00:27:17.867 --> 00:27:20.587
<v Sam Iosevich>I just want to make sure if there's any
areas that I need to go into more depth.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3740-0
00:27:20.587 --> 00:27:22.787
<v Sam Iosevich>Happy, happy, happy to do happy.
Happy to do so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3765-0
00:27:24.497 --> 00:27:29.127
<v Sam Iosevich>So. So by the way,
when we when we talk about so this this</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3765-1
00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:34.777
<v Sam Iosevich>hypercube which sits in the middle of all
of these different functions.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3776-0
00:27:36.377 --> 00:27:39.777
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, so So what really is that right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3779-0
00:27:39.817 --> 00:27:40.937
<v Sam Iosevich>It is a.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3788-0
00:27:41.777 --> 00:27:45.857
<v Sam Iosevich>It is a projection so so when we talk
about cubes, right, we talked about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3801-0
00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:48.367
<v Sam Iosevich>Know in in the concept of business
intelligence.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3804-0
00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:50.087
<v Sam Iosevich>But that's all backward.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3812-0
00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:53.247
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
historical viewing backward looking right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3829-0
00:27:53.247 --> 00:28:00.071
<v Sam Iosevich>This is A1 self reconciling demand signal
across all of your all of your</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3829-1
00:28:00.071 --> 00:28:01.847
<v Sam Iosevich>hierarchies, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3836-0
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:05.047
<v Sam Iosevich>And here's some examples of of a
hierarchy for, let's say.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3843-0
00:28:06.537 --> 00:28:08.177
<v Sam Iosevich>For you know, for for a company.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3858-0
00:28:08.177 --> 00:28:12.166
<v Sam Iosevich>So let's see.
We go from total merch all the way down</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3858-1
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:16.377
<v Sam Iosevich>to orderable SKU and then it's connected
to to material.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3883-0
00:28:16.687 --> 00:28:19.927
<v Sam Iosevich>So so this is this is where you can start.
You know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3883-1
00:28:19.927 --> 00:28:24.573
<v Sam Iosevich>use your bill of materials to get from
audible SKU all the way down to your</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3883-2
00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:25.367
<v Sam Iosevich>material SKU.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3893-0
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:30.127
<v Sam Iosevich>So you can do some of your demand supply
plan balancing, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3925-0
00:28:30.127 --> 00:28:34.386
<v Sam Iosevich>So think about a situation where you
start pulling levers where you start</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3925-1
00:28:34.386 --> 00:28:38.646
<v Sam Iosevich>running simulations around what would
happen in a high consumer sentiment</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3925-2
00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:42.847
<v Sam Iosevich>environment or high inflation environment,
which by the way, we've done.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3938-0
00:28:43.577 --> 00:28:45.798
<v Sam Iosevich>For a very large company,
about six months before the supply chain</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3938-1
00:28:45.798 --> 00:28:47.057
<v Sam Iosevich>brunch, and they wound up to actually.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3956-0
00:28:47.967 --> 00:28:51.652
<v Sam Iosevich>Weathering it a lot better,
but you start to understand well, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3956-1
00:28:51.652 --> 00:28:53.047
<v Sam Iosevich>If you pull those levers.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3972-0
00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:58.123
<v Sam Iosevich>What does that mean in terms of, you know,
capacity planning or material planning,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3972-1
00:28:58.123 --> 00:28:59.327
<v Sam Iosevich>things of that sort?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3983-0
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:04.807
<v Sam Iosevich>How many DC slots am I going to need in a
particular in a particular region?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3984-0
00:29:04.847 --> 00:29:06.247
<v Sam Iosevich>What is my category mix?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/3996-0
00:29:07.777 --> 00:29:11.617
<v Sam Iosevich>Going to look like in different
environments, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4004-0
00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:15.057
<v Sam Iosevich>And then there's a time hierarchy there,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4008-0
00:29:15.057 --> 00:29:16.977
<v Sam Iosevich>So sometimes we can go intraday.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4012-0
00:29:17.207 --> 00:29:18.647
<v Sam Iosevich>Like this one goes from day.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4018-0
00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:22.857
<v Sam Iosevich>All the way up to rolling by.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4021-0
00:29:24.577 --> 00:29:24.937
<v Sam Iosevich>Year, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4029-0
00:29:26.497 --> 00:29:29.377
<v Sam Iosevich>So depending on on the function.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4036-0
00:29:31.297 --> 00:29:33.097
<v Sam Iosevich>There is going to be a a different need.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4069-0
00:29:33.097 --> 00:29:37.245
<v Sam Iosevich>I mean, if we're talking about labor,
if you're planning labor,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4069-1
00:29:37.245 --> 00:29:40.291
<v Sam Iosevich>you want it down to the day or intraday
level.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4069-2
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:44.244
<v Sam Iosevich>If you're talking about a capital
investment, then you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4069-3
00:29:44.244 --> 00:29:46.577
<v Sam Iosevich>then the needs could be by by month.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4099-0
00:29:47.167 --> 00:29:52.747
<v Sam Iosevich>Or or even sometimes by by year.
If we're talking about a long range</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4099-1
00:29:52.747 --> 00:29:58.651
<v Sam Iosevich>planning planning process. OK,
so that that is the unified demand signal</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4099-2
00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:02.047
<v Sam Iosevich>that actually powers what we talked about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4113-0
00:30:02.087 --> 00:30:07.807
<v Sam Iosevich>Now let's seek out just for a little bit
now in terms of in terms of AI, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4128-0
00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:12.560
<v Sam Iosevich>So when you're talking about the some of
the large language models and some of the,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4128-1
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.767
<v Sam Iosevich>you know, getting more accurate, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4141-0
00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:21.947
<v Sam Iosevich>By having this, you know, architecture,
what we can do is we can.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4155-0
00:30:23.417 --> 00:30:28.380
<v Sam Iosevich>We can train the we can do a lot of
prompt engineering around teaching the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4155-1
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:28.777
<v Sam Iosevich>model.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4163-0
00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:30.897
<v Sam Iosevich>What the data?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4167-0
00:30:30.937 --> 00:30:32.857
<v Sam Iosevich>What the data is right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4189-0
00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:35.662
<v Sam Iosevich>So every customer is gonna have their own
hierarchy,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4189-1
00:30:35.662 --> 00:30:39.053
<v Sam Iosevich>but we can teach the model to say, OK,
this is this is your Geo,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4189-2
00:30:39.053 --> 00:30:41.817
<v Sam Iosevich>these are your prod,
this is your channel hierarchy.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4196-0
00:30:41.817 --> 00:30:43.777
<v Sam Iosevich>These are your demand drivers and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4215-0
00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:49.306
<v Sam Iosevich>And so the language,
the large language model has has an</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4215-1
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:55.527
<v Sam Iosevich>advantage with an advantage in
understanding your your your data OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4232-0
00:30:55.607 --> 00:31:01.635
<v Sam Iosevich>And that's a that's a big step forward in
getting better or more accurate results</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4232-1
00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:04.207
<v Sam Iosevich>coming out of the out of the model.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4254-0
00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:09.629
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, even with, you know,
if you look at 01 and you know the the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4254-1
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:13.393
<v Sam Iosevich>open eye, the 13 models,
I mean that they're getting better by the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4254-2
00:31:13.393 --> 00:31:13.617
<v Sam Iosevich>day.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4273-0
00:31:15.247 --> 00:31:21.058
<v Sam Iosevich>But Amy Legg up that you can give them is
going to is going to get to you to to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4273-1
00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:23.527
<v Sam Iosevich>much, much better place all right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4303-0
00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:27.655
<v Sam Iosevich>Well, how you know?
Just very quickly how do we actually get</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4303-1
00:31:27.655 --> 00:31:31.926
<v Sam Iosevich>to this this hypercube. And by the way,
for each of those nodes,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4303-2
00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:35.145
<v Sam Iosevich>again across all of these different
hierarchies,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4303-3
00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:38.167
<v Sam Iosevich>not only do you have a projection, right,
so.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4317-0
00:31:39.137 --> 00:31:43.377
<v Sam Iosevich>And the companies that we work with that
goes that, it goes for up to you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4346-0
00:31:43.727 --> 00:31:47.191
<v Sam Iosevich>Six years out. So we're talking about,
you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4346-1
00:31:47.191 --> 00:31:52.563
<v Sam Iosevich>day short term all the way to six,
six years out from the lowest persistent</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4346-2
00:31:52.563 --> 00:31:55.603
<v Sam Iosevich>level,
all the way to total company across</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4346-3
00:31:55.603 --> 00:31:57.087
<v Sam Iosevich>across the hierarchy.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4352-0
00:31:57.087 --> 00:31:59.007
<v Sam Iosevich>So how do we how do we do that?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4361-0
00:32:00.007 --> 00:32:03.796
<v Sam Iosevich>I'm gonna.
I'm gonna run you through a a kind of a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4361-1
00:32:03.796 --> 00:32:05.727
<v Sam Iosevich>of a, you know, just just.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4365-0
00:32:07.137 --> 00:32:08.097
<v Sam Iosevich>Just a few things that are there.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4371-0
00:32:09.817 --> 00:32:12.297
<v Sam Iosevich>That are required to make to make this
happen.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4416-0
00:32:12.807 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Sam Iosevich>As I'll point this out, you know,
by the way,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4416-1
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.670
<v Sam Iosevich>some of this these will turn into agents,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4416-2
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:25.232
<v Sam Iosevich>That we can that the we can call on but
but basically to fill the hypercube.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4416-3
00:32:25.232 --> 00:32:30.577
<v Sam Iosevich>The first thing that you need you got
data coming in all the time, right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4429-0
00:32:30.577 --> 00:32:35.167
<v Sam Iosevich>So we have an automated data cleansing
methodology, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4433-0
00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:37.087
<v Sam Iosevich>That you really have to pay attention to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4443-0
00:32:38.577 --> 00:32:41.297
<v Sam Iosevich>So you know, so you know,
there are things that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4474-0
00:32:43.247 --> 00:32:46.084
<v Sam Iosevich>Like like product lineage,
right connecting,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4474-1
00:32:46.084 --> 00:32:50.496
<v Sam Iosevich>connecting different items.
Understanding where you need to impute to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4474-2
00:32:50.496 --> 00:32:55.287
<v Sam Iosevich>impute demand and we've been working on
on imputation algorithms and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4510-0
00:32:55.447 --> 00:32:59.804
<v Sam Iosevich>You know their data filters and so on,
and we do this all in an in a in an</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4510-1
00:32:59.804 --> 00:33:03.405
<v Sam Iosevich>automated way that you know happens
either in a weekly basis,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4510-2
00:33:03.405 --> 00:33:07.297
<v Sam Iosevich>a daily or or a monthly basis,
depending on how often we run these</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4510-3
00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:09.097
<v Sam Iosevich>models. We have a driver model.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4514-0
00:33:09.897 --> 00:33:10.857
<v Sam Iosevich>Capability which.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4516-0
00:33:10.857 --> 00:33:11.417
<v Sam Iosevich>Which actually?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4535-0
00:33:12.167 --> 00:33:17.563
<v Sam Iosevich>We've been it has been evolving for, for,
for, for many, many years,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4535-1
00:33:17.563 --> 00:33:20.847
<v Sam Iosevich>which allows us to take in a dozens of of.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4547-0
00:33:22.377 --> 00:33:24.937
<v Sam Iosevich>External as well as internal factors,
you know we talked about price.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4554-0
00:33:24.937 --> 00:33:27.377
<v Sam Iosevich>Can you know?
You could think about cross elasticity?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4561-0
00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:28.897
<v Sam Iosevich>Your own elasticity.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4587-0
00:33:28.897 --> 00:33:34.172
<v Sam Iosevich>Consumer sentiment inflation. You know,
in all of those things working,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4587-1
00:33:34.172 --> 00:33:39.959
<v Sam Iosevich>working together and and actually being
able to isolate those factors and take</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4587-2
00:33:39.959 --> 00:33:41.497
<v Sam Iosevich>those out of what we.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4589-0
00:33:41.927 --> 00:33:42.447
<v Sam Iosevich>Call.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4592-0
00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:44.617
<v Sam Iosevich>A.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4608-0
00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:50.422
<v Sam Iosevich>You know intrinsic demand and then there
is this algorithm that there's the based</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4608-1
00:33:50.422 --> 00:33:53.537
<v Sam Iosevich>on the paper that Eric,
George and I wrote.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4635-0
00:33:55.737 --> 00:34:00.869
<v Sam Iosevich>But but this concept of dynamic
aggregation is figuring out what is the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4635-1
00:34:00.869 --> 00:34:05.217
<v Sam Iosevich>right level to produce a demand a a,
a demand signal, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4639-0
00:34:05.297 --> 00:34:07.057
<v Sam Iosevich>So it turns outlook.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4649-0
00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:11.297
<v Sam Iosevich>There's a lot of algorithms out there,
it turns out for still, if you need.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4669-0
00:34:11.847 --> 00:34:15.215
<v Sam Iosevich>A telescopic forecast if you want one
signal,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4669-1
00:34:15.215 --> 00:34:19.607
<v Sam Iosevich>there's still you know the time series
algorithms still do.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4681-0
00:34:19.607 --> 00:34:23.607
<v Sam Iosevich>Extremely, extremely well there,
but the key is understanding it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4686-0
00:34:23.607 --> 00:34:25.007
<v Sam Iosevich>What is the lowest level?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4710-0
00:34:25.007 --> 00:34:30.468
<v Sam Iosevich>What is the level at which you can get
the bet the right signal to noise ratio</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4710-1
00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:33.578
<v Sam Iosevich>right?
To be able to produce a stable signal</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4710-2
00:34:33.578 --> 00:34:34.407
<v Sam Iosevich>across time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4723-0
00:34:34.407 --> 00:34:38.194
<v Sam Iosevich>There's a champion Challenger modeling
model for base demand forecasting.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4723-1
00:34:38.194 --> 00:34:40.087
<v Sam Iosevich>Once we understand what is the right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4728-0
00:34:40.817 --> 00:34:41.697
<v Sam Iosevich>What is the right level?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4733-0
00:34:41.737 --> 00:34:43.617
<v Sam Iosevich>A lot of that is commodity we keep adding.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4766-0
00:34:44.327 --> 00:34:49.553
<v Sam Iosevich>Other algorithms in here all the time and
it could be Lstms or it could be</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4766-1
00:34:49.553 --> 00:34:53.455
<v Sam Iosevich>exponential smoothing models and so on.
And by the way,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4766-2
00:34:53.455 --> 00:34:57.287
<v Sam Iosevich>they'll still win a lot in in the
champion challenger.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4774-0
00:34:59.537 --> 00:35:00.497
<v Sam Iosevich>Format and then look.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4808-0
00:35:00.497 --> 00:35:05.764
<v Sam Iosevich>It's really using and then we, you know,
depend with the regardless of the level,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4808-1
00:35:05.764 --> 00:35:09.554
<v Sam Iosevich>we'll still need to get a signal at the
very lowest level,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4808-2
00:35:09.554 --> 00:35:14.371
<v Sam Iosevich>so we'll use a combination of of
attributes and and sales to to get to get</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4808-3
00:35:14.371 --> 00:35:15.977
<v Sam Iosevich>to the very lowest level.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4814-0
00:35:16.207 --> 00:35:20.127
<v Sam Iosevich>Level,
except now we also utilize things like.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4861-0
00:35:21.617 --> 00:35:27.029
<v Sam Iosevich>We will scrape information from the web
to understand trends for for for you know</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4861-1
00:35:27.029 --> 00:35:31.648
<v Sam Iosevich>certain attributes, and and so on.
And then we use that again in, in,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4861-2
00:35:31.648 --> 00:35:35.872
<v Sam Iosevich>in the disaggregation,
there's a company called First Insights,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4861-3
00:35:35.872 --> 00:35:39.897
<v Sam Iosevich>which has a value score which will tell
you which will tell.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4877-0
00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:43.031
<v Sam Iosevich>You how for example,
how customers view different.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4877-1
00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:45.857
<v Sam Iosevich>You know if you if you have a style of
shoes.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4900-0
00:35:46.327 --> 00:35:49.755
<v Sam Iosevich>For example,
how they view one caller with respect to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4900-1
00:35:49.755 --> 00:35:54.007
<v Sam Iosevich>the other and that could be an input into
the segregation as well.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4915-0
00:35:54.007 --> 00:35:57.134
<v Sam Iosevich>And then you need some diagnostics to
understand what's going on,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4915-1
00:35:57.134 --> 00:35:59.407
<v Sam Iosevich>including things like anomaly detection,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4921-0
00:35:59.447 --> 00:36:02.927
<v Sam Iosevich>To help you detect issues early on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4936-0
00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:08.963
<v Sam Iosevich>So all of this together helps us form
this demand signal that we put into the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4936-1
00:36:08.963 --> 00:36:10.807
<v Sam Iosevich>to the hypercube, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4942-0
00:36:11.537 --> 00:36:13.777
<v Sam Iosevich>This is for better decision making.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4968-0
00:36:15.107 --> 00:36:20.715
<v Sam Iosevich>OK, a lot of information here, by the way,
as I mentioned to you all and to Erik at</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/4968-1
00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:25.387
<v Sam Iosevich>the beginning of all this,
I'm going to share these these slides, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5014-0
00:36:27.577 --> 00:36:33.035
<v Sam Iosevich>In the so, so, so by the way,
in terms of and and now now after we we</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5014-1
00:36:33.035 --> 00:36:38.338
<v Sam Iosevich>get this hypercube right,
let's talk a little bit about some of the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5014-2
00:36:38.338 --> 00:36:44.186
<v Sam Iosevich>other components that we work with for,
for you know this you know for the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5014-3
00:36:44.186 --> 00:36:46.057
<v Sam Iosevich>decision making process.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5061-0
00:36:46.207 --> 00:36:52.412
<v Sam Iosevich>Process so the hypercube right is the
basis from which we're gonna start to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5061-1
00:36:52.412 --> 00:36:56.168
<v Sam Iosevich>work.
To help us make these better decisions.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5061-2
00:36:56.168 --> 00:37:00.822
<v Sam Iosevich>So on top of this,
on top of this unified demand signal,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5061-3
00:37:00.822 --> 00:37:07.436
<v Sam Iosevich>we have what I call an optimization layer
and that optimization layer is a multi</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5061-4
00:37:07.436 --> 00:37:08.007
<v Sam Iosevich>object.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5068-0
00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:12.047
<v Sam Iosevich>Optimization. What do I mean by that?
Right is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5073-0
00:37:12.777 --> 00:37:13.897
<v Sam Iosevich>You know you.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5076-0
00:37:13.897 --> 00:37:15.537
<v Sam Iosevich>You will see instead of just optimizing.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5115-0
00:37:15.687 --> 00:37:20.342
<v Sam Iosevich>Margin or let's say revenue,
you can actually optimize on multiple</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5115-1
00:37:20.342 --> 00:37:25.552
<v Sam Iosevich>objectives like a revenue margin, units,
other other things as well in the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5115-2
00:37:25.552 --> 00:37:28.609
<v Sam Iosevich>proportion of strategic or category
intent.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5115-3
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Sam Iosevich>And since by the way we also produce
probabilistic forecast at the lowest</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5115-4
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.167
<v Sam Iosevich>level.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5142-0
00:37:35.617 --> 00:37:41.222
<v Sam Iosevich>You know then then you can use it for
inventory optimization as as well.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5142-1
00:37:41.222 --> 00:37:45.137
<v Sam Iosevich>OK now so so you can then optimize on top
of that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5169-0
00:37:45.487 --> 00:37:51.089
<v Sam Iosevich>We have our collaboration layer in
collaboration layer is your visualization,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5169-1
00:37:51.089 --> 00:37:56.834
<v Sam Iosevich>your planning layer and that's where the
generative AI or the gentech AI really</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5169-2
00:37:56.834 --> 00:37:57.767
<v Sam Iosevich>comes in, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5184-0
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:06.401
<v Sam Iosevich>So that sits on top of your optimization
and and your hyper and your hyper queue.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5184-1
00:38:06.401 --> 00:38:06.687
<v Sam Iosevich>OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5192-0
00:38:08.167 --> 00:38:10.647
<v Sam Iosevich>So then you can think about well,
wait a second now.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5193-0
00:38:10.647 --> 00:38:11.967
<v Sam Iosevich>I can ask now.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5201-0
00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.817
<v Sam Iosevich>I can start to ask you the hyper.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5204-0
00:38:14.927 --> 00:38:16.247
<v Sam Iosevich>Cube for example.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5219-0
00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:20.017
<v Sam Iosevich>Of you know,
one of my highest trending products,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5219-1
00:38:20.017 --> 00:38:21.777
<v Sam Iosevich>you know from an information standpoint.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5224-0
00:38:21.777 --> 00:38:24.137
<v Sam Iosevich>But you could also start doing is to say
well.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5227-0
00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:26.257
<v Sam Iosevich>Can you?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5245-0
00:38:26.257 --> 00:38:29.017
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
let's say optimize a particular category,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5245-1
00:38:29.017 --> 00:38:31.777
<v Sam Iosevich>the price for a particular category to
drive units.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5249-0
00:38:31.777 --> 00:38:33.537
<v Sam Iosevich>Let's say you're down down units.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5272-0
00:38:33.537 --> 00:38:36.628
<v Sam Iosevich>Well,
it can produce different scenarios for</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5272-1
00:38:36.628 --> 00:38:42.192
<v Sam Iosevich>you and do this without having to go to
an analyst and ask him to run to run the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5272-2
00:38:42.192 --> 00:38:43.497
<v Sam Iosevich>particular process.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5276-0
00:38:44.607 --> 00:38:45.407
<v Sam Iosevich>It will.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5284-0
00:38:45.447 --> 00:38:47.967
<v Sam Iosevich>It will actually take that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5321-0
00:38:48.047 --> 00:38:52.731
<v Sam Iosevich>It'll know to call a particular agent to
run that particular simulation and</v>

00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:56.736
<v Sam Iosevich>produce and and and come back with a set
of of of results right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5321-2
00:38:56.736 --> 00:39:01.851
<v Sam Iosevich>When we talk about the AI sophistication
curve and we will get there and we'll get</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5321-3
00:39:01.851 --> 00:39:03.207
<v Sam Iosevich>there in a little bit.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5325-0
00:39:05.807 --> 00:39:07.047
<v Sam Iosevich>You you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5329-0
00:39:08.977 --> 00:39:09.297
<v Sam Iosevich>The real.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5333-0
00:39:09.297 --> 00:39:10.537
<v Sam Iosevich>The real then challenge is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5339-0
00:39:12.337 --> 00:39:14.177
<v Sam Iosevich>The last step of that is actually.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5350-0
00:39:15.817 --> 00:39:18.297
<v Sam Iosevich>Tell me you know,
give me a business challenge, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5367-0
00:39:18.417 --> 00:39:26.367
<v Sam Iosevich>And then have the have the agent take AI
run multiple scenarios in multiple agents</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5367-1
00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:28.857
<v Sam Iosevich>in different order, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5380-0
00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:32.697
<v Sam Iosevich>Accounting for constraints in the
different functions.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5384-0
00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:35.577
<v Sam Iosevich>Remember we talked about now the
different functions are connected.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5400-0
00:39:36.047 --> 00:39:38.842
<v Sam Iosevich>Right.
Because we have this one demand signal</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5400-1
00:39:38.842 --> 00:39:40.847
<v Sam Iosevich>which is across multiple metrics.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5433-0
00:39:40.847 --> 00:39:44.565
<v Sam Iosevich>So now when you run a scenario,
for example for price,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5433-1
00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:49.838
<v Sam Iosevich>you understand if you're running into
constraints from a labor perspective or</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5433-2
00:39:49.838 --> 00:39:53.015
<v Sam Iosevich>from,
you know in things that you may have not</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5433-3
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:56.327
<v Sam Iosevich>taken into account into that optimization
model.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5459-0
00:39:57.817 --> 00:40:01.791
<v Sam Iosevich>And and run that in in in in different
you know in different in different order</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5459-1
00:40:01.791 --> 00:40:05.417
<v Sam Iosevich>and so on to give you multiple scenarios
for for you to make a business.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5463-0
00:40:06.327 --> 00:40:07.687
<v Sam Iosevich>Business decision, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5508-0
00:40:10.417 --> 00:40:13.155
<v Sam Iosevich>So,
so to kind of bring that home a little</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5508-1
00:40:13.155 --> 00:40:16.721
<v Sam Iosevich>bit, you know,
I want to talk a little bit about price,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5508-2
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:21.750
<v Sam Iosevich>you know, price optimization, you know,
so how and how that you know the these</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5508-3
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.297
<v Sam Iosevich>multi metrics work in a multi objective.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5526-0
00:40:26.017 --> 00:40:30.365
<v Sam Iosevich>Scenario right?
So so typically you know when we thought</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5526-1
00:40:30.365 --> 00:40:35.857
<v Sam Iosevich>when we we did a price optimization in
the old old way of doing things.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5534-0
00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.567
<v Sam Iosevich>Things basically we looked at.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5537-0
00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:41.527
<v Sam Iosevich>There was a margin.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5556-0
00:40:41.527 --> 00:40:46.088
<v Sam Iosevich>There was usually a margin focused and we
would find the, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5556-1
00:40:46.088 --> 00:40:48.167
<v Sam Iosevich>way of optimizing gross margin.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5582-0
00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:53.712
<v Sam Iosevich>Then we would look a little bit to the
right left depending on revenue. And yeah,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5582-1
00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:59.190
<v Sam Iosevich>I mean and that's what we would we would
go with whereas today we take more of a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5582-2
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.407
<v Sam Iosevich>balanced approach.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5590-0
00:41:01.217 --> 00:41:03.697
<v Sam Iosevich>Right.
We we don't only look at revenue margin.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5595-0
00:41:05.617 --> 00:41:06.657
<v Sam Iosevich>And we we really you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5613-0
00:41:06.887 --> 00:41:09.345
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
we really look at what does that do to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5613-1
00:41:09.345 --> 00:41:12.555
<v Sam Iosevich>our share. There was a,
there was a large company that I worked</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5613-2
00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:13.207
<v Sam Iosevich>with in 2005.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5624-0
00:41:14.977 --> 00:41:16.457
<v Sam Iosevich>But look, I'll just say it right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5656-0
00:41:16.457 --> 00:41:20.218
<v Sam Iosevich>It was worked with Sears,
right and where we were optimizing,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5656-1
00:41:20.218 --> 00:41:24.827
<v Sam Iosevich>we were optimizing price for them,
doing price optimization for them in the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5656-2
00:41:24.827 --> 00:41:27.799
<v Sam Iosevich>first year,
we took out a lot in terms of gross,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5656-3
00:41:27.799 --> 00:41:31.377
<v Sam Iosevich>in terms of additional margin and you
know Ndas and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5669-0
00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:33.612
<v Sam Iosevich>Can't tell you exactly what that number
is and so on,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5669-1
00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:34.977
<v Sam Iosevich>but it was it was a large amount.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5678-0
00:41:34.977 --> 00:41:37.177
<v Sam Iosevich>Next year,
you could take less and less and less.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5679-0
00:41:37.177 --> 00:41:39.257
<v Sam Iosevich>Today I would ask you.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5682-0
00:41:40.217 --> 00:41:40.777
<v Sam Iosevich>To find me or.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5696-0
00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:44.527
<v Sam Iosevich>Tell me where your local seer store is.
It's not.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5700-0
00:41:44.647 --> 00:41:45.767
<v Sam Iosevich>It's not there, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5705-0
00:41:45.767 --> 00:41:47.407
<v Sam Iosevich>Is, is is the answer.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5739-0
00:41:47.887 --> 00:41:51.555
<v Sam Iosevich>And then of course you can go the the the
other direction,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5739-1
00:41:51.555 --> 00:41:56.154
<v Sam Iosevich>which is you can be completely unit
focused and that's the example of the</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5739-2
00:41:56.154 --> 00:41:59.138
<v Sam Iosevich>right there where you're solely focused
on, on,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5739-3
00:41:59.138 --> 00:42:03.986
<v Sam Iosevich>on just you know driving shared driving
units and then you know you know that</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5739-4
00:42:03.986 --> 00:42:04.297
<v Sam Iosevich>scen.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5753-0
00:42:04.297 --> 00:42:08.607
<v Sam Iosevich>Where you have A380 basis points drop in
in margin you know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5761-0
00:42:09.297 --> 00:42:11.217
<v Sam Iosevich>If you have acfo,
that'll never see the light of day.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5795-0
00:42:12.207 --> 00:42:16.087
<v Sam Iosevich>So we don't have to worry about that that
scenario,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5795-1
00:42:16.087 --> 00:42:21.907
<v Sam Iosevich>but a more of a balanced approach really
allows you based on on your category</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5795-2
00:42:21.907 --> 00:42:26.607
<v Sam Iosevich>strategic intent is to to keep all of
those things in balance.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5811-0
00:42:26.647 --> 00:42:31.719
<v Sam Iosevich>What I've seen my career over the last 20
some years is you pull the lever in One</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5811-1
00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:33.327
<v Sam Iosevich>Direction too hard, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5827-0
00:42:33.367 --> 00:42:37.241
<v Sam Iosevich>And then, Oh my gosh,
2 two months later you say, whoa,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5827-1
00:42:37.241 --> 00:42:40.007
<v Sam Iosevich>what happened to? To to Eunice and then?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5829-0
00:42:40.007 --> 00:42:40.967
<v Sam Iosevich>Then then you go overboard.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5835-0
00:42:41.087 --> 00:42:43.887
<v Sam Iosevich>The other direction,
and so on versus taking.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5839-0
00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:46.297
<v Sam Iosevich>A more balanced approach.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5861-0
00:42:47.937 --> 00:42:52.360
<v Sam Iosevich>To to begin with. OK.
The other thing is you also need to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5861-1
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.774
<v Sam Iosevich>understand what is happening to to
competition which which by the way,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5861-2
00:42:57.774 --> 00:43:00.977
<v Sam Iosevich>you'd say, well, wait a second, don't you?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5880-0
00:43:02.817 --> 00:43:05.923
<v Sam Iosevich>So, so,
so typically what we what we do is</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5880-1
00:43:05.923 --> 00:43:10.257
<v Sam Iosevich>companies will identify what are called
as key value items.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5901-0
00:43:10.687 --> 00:43:14.040
<v Sam Iosevich>Right.
And so those key value items which you</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5901-1
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:19.142
<v Sam Iosevich>will do based on brand image,
you will you will match against against</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5901-2
00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:20.527
<v Sam Iosevich>competition, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5939-0
00:43:20.527 --> 00:43:23.857
<v Sam Iosevich>You're going to be either 5% lower than,
let's say,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5939-1
00:43:23.857 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Sam Iosevich>or 5% higher or right at you'll match
Walmart or ALDI,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5939-2
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.286
<v Sam Iosevich>let's say in this or you know,
and then for everything else,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5939-3
00:43:31.286 --> 00:43:36.217
<v Sam Iosevich>you will optimize the rest of that
particular choice set in such a way that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5947-0
00:43:36.217 --> 00:43:39.567
<v Sam Iosevich>You're optimizing the metrics that we
talked about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5951-0
00:43:41.007 --> 00:43:43.167
<v Sam Iosevich>Before, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5969-0
00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:46.573
<v Sam Iosevich>But now that you are looking at all of
those metrics,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/5969-1
00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:49.087
<v Sam Iosevich>you can and you can run simulations,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6005-0
00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:54.785
<v Sam Iosevich>You can see where and you know and you do
have this generative AI capability and of</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6005-1
00:43:54.785 --> 00:44:00.007
<v Sam Iosevich>asking, let's say the the hypercube.
You can now have the analysts start to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6011-0
00:44:00.127 --> 00:44:01.727
<v Sam Iosevich>I mean, you don't need a business analyst.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6017-0
00:44:01.727 --> 00:44:04.887
<v Sam Iosevich>You can have the business user start to
ask.</v>

00:44:06.897 --> 00:44:07.137
<v Sam Iosevich>The.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6025-0
00:44:07.297 --> 00:44:08.377
<v Sam Iosevich>The the hypercube, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6029-0
00:44:08.377 --> 00:44:09.777
<v Sam Iosevich>What we call ask the hypercube.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6064-0
00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Sam Iosevich>To give you scenarios what would happen
if I was to do to do certain certain</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6064-1
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.819
<v Sam Iosevich>things,
which and I I know I know where we're</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6064-2
00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:22.927
<v Sam Iosevich>going to be against time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6068-0
00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:25.207
<v Sam Iosevich>So. So I'm going to switch to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6072-0
00:44:25.207 --> 00:44:26.167
<v Sam Iosevich>I'm going to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6080-0
00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:28.927
<v Sam Iosevich>That's why I want to get to the AI
sophistication curve.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6091-0
00:44:30.457 --> 00:44:33.817
<v Sam Iosevich>Here and and just just bring this all all
together, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6100-0
00:44:33.817 --> 00:44:37.441
<v Sam Iosevich>So we talk when I talk about AI
sophistication curve in the supportive</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6100-1
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.257
<v Sam Iosevich>decision making.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6104-0
00:44:38.257 --> 00:44:39.337
<v Sam Iosevich>What does that?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6105-0
00:44:39.457 --> 00:44:40.297
<v Sam Iosevich>What does that?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6152-0
00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:47.740
<v Sam Iosevich>That really mean and and by the way,
this was our way of of also focusing on</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6152-1
00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.957
<v Sam Iosevich>on augmentation,
right and getting to something useful,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6152-2
00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:57.149
<v Sam Iosevich>right.
And continuing up that sophistication</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6152-3
00:44:57.149 --> 00:45:01.807
<v Sam Iosevich>curve as as our models became more more
accurate.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6169-0
00:45:01.807 --> 00:45:05.667
<v Sam Iosevich>So the first thing is, you know,
that's very easy and you know within you</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6169-1
00:45:05.667 --> 00:45:08.327
<v Sam Iosevich>know the planning application which you
have here.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6176-0
00:45:09.097 --> 00:45:10.617
<v Sam Iosevich>You, you know, you go around planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6195-0
00:45:11.407 --> 00:45:16.174
<v Sam Iosevich>But but as you're planning,
you may have questions like what are my</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6195-1
00:45:16.174 --> 00:45:18.487
<v Sam Iosevich>highest price elasticity classes.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6202-0
00:45:18.957 --> 00:45:22.397
<v Sam Iosevich>What is my sell through rate by subclass
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6206-0
00:45:22.397 --> 00:45:24.157
<v Sam Iosevich>These are easy queries, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6224-0
00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:27.277
<v Sam Iosevich>You look at that,
you look at those historically,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6224-1
00:45:27.277 --> 00:45:30.397
<v Sam Iosevich>but you should be able to write them in
this way.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6232-0
00:45:30.397 --> 00:45:32.597
<v Sam Iosevich>There's no reason for a planner.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6250-0
00:45:32.757 --> 00:45:37.824
<v Sam Iosevich>You know what would happen to have to
happen in the in in the past is you would</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6250-1
00:45:37.824 --> 00:45:40.357
<v Sam Iosevich>write an e-mail to to an analyst, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6258-0
00:45:40.357 --> 00:45:42.757
<v Sam Iosevich>They would go and run a query.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6261-0
00:45:42.797 --> 00:45:44.717
<v Sam Iosevich>They'd come back to you and.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6271-0
00:45:45.247 --> 00:45:48.047
<v Sam Iosevich>The query was not quite right,
so sometimes this could be.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6277-0
00:45:48.437 --> 00:45:49.717
<v Sam Iosevich>A 2-3 day process.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6280-0
00:45:49.717 --> 00:45:50.077
<v Sam Iosevich>I'm not.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6284-0
00:45:50.157 --> 00:45:52.557
<v Sam Iosevich>I'm. I'm not joking right today.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6290-0
00:45:52.557 --> 00:45:56.557
<v Sam Iosevich>Today it's and this is, you know,
very accurate.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6325-0
00:45:58.207 --> 00:46:02.702
<v Sam Iosevich>You can come in basically within the
application while you're planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6325-1
00:46:02.702 --> 00:46:06.822
<v Sam Iosevich>You pull up the ask the hypercube.
You know, hit a bit that icon,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6325-2
00:46:06.822 --> 00:46:10.755
<v Sam Iosevich>but type in the question.
In English it comes back to you very</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6325-3
00:46:10.755 --> 00:46:14.313
<v Sam Iosevich>quickly with with,
with your answers and and you keep on</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6325-4
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:14.687
<v Sam Iosevich>going.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6330-0
00:46:14.807 --> 00:46:16.927
<v Sam Iosevich>Within, you know within the application.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6337-0
00:46:17.597 --> 00:46:18.677
<v Sam Iosevich>Yes, we do this.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6338-0
00:46:18.677 --> 00:46:19.277
<v Sam Iosevich>But there's a.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6351-0
00:46:19.437 --> 00:46:22.717
<v Sam Iosevich>There's a slew of folks that do this as
well. You can do this with lagility.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6359-0
00:46:22.717 --> 00:46:27.437
<v Sam Iosevich>You can do this within a number of
different different applications.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6371-0
00:46:27.437 --> 00:46:30.677
<v Sam Iosevich>This is becoming this is table stakes now,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6381-0
00:46:30.717 --> 00:46:36.077
<v Sam Iosevich>You will never live in a world that we
lived in 10-15 years ago.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6390-0
00:46:36.077 --> 00:46:39.167
<v Sam Iosevich>Where where?
You know where you have that interaction</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6390-1
00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:40.597
<v Sam Iosevich>that that I talked about.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6396-0
00:46:42.127 --> 00:46:43.807
<v Sam Iosevich>Then we went further. OK, great.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6404-0
00:46:43.807 --> 00:46:46.847
<v Sam Iosevich>Give me the basic information,
but then the next step is.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6407-0
00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:48.397
<v Sam Iosevich>Process now.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6422-0
00:46:48.397 --> 00:46:53.276
<v Sam Iosevich>Process that information. OK,
so so basically run some simple analysis</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6422-1
00:46:53.276 --> 00:46:53.757
<v Sam Iosevich>for me.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6431-0
00:46:53.797 --> 00:46:59.197
<v Sam Iosevich>Run a Pareto analysis on SKU sales with a
higher within a higher level, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6437-0
00:46:59.237 --> 00:47:01.117
<v Sam Iosevich>So, you know, do I have a long?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6442-0
00:47:01.237 --> 00:47:02.557
<v Sam Iosevich>Do I have a long tail?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6453-0
00:47:03.437 --> 00:47:05.248
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
this is the question that we ask</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6453-1
00:47:05.248 --> 00:47:06.637
<v Sam Iosevich>ourselves in assortment planning.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6455-0
00:47:07.237 --> 00:47:08.797
<v Sam Iosevich>All all, all the time.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6477-0
00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:14.386
<v Sam Iosevich>Then you can like you know if you also
have the inventory you know for example</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6477-1
00:47:14.386 --> 00:47:16.647
<v Sam Iosevich>you may say you know I gave you an
example.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6487-0
00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:20.077
<v Sam Iosevich>Of running the BOGO the customer comes in,
you've got empty shelves, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6500-0
00:47:21.887 --> 00:47:26.447
<v Sam Iosevich>So let's analyze lost sales right for a
merchandise class.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6508-0
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:31.007
<v Sam Iosevich>Linked to a specific event, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6511-0
00:47:31.007 --> 00:47:32.287
<v Sam Iosevich>So what went?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6512-0
00:47:32.487 --> 00:47:33.247
<v Sam Iosevich>What went wrong?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6529-0
00:47:34.927 --> 00:47:38.438
<v Sam Iosevich>And and that's that's, you know.
And so now you're getting more and more</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6529-1
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:38.967
<v Sam Iosevich>ROI, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6534-0
00:47:38.967 --> 00:47:42.847
<v Sam Iosevich>You know, off from this,
this this as you move along.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6543-0
00:47:44.527 --> 00:47:48.287
<v Sam Iosevich>And then and then we, we, we,
we we took it a step further.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6553-0
00:47:48.597 --> 00:47:51.677
<v Sam Iosevich>Right, so help me evaluate options, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6568-0
00:47:51.677 --> 00:47:55.054
<v Sam Iosevich>So we talked about all of these levers
that you have within the hypercube where</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/6568-1
00:47:55.054 --> 00:47:57.797
<v Sam Iosevich>you know you could, you know,

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7229-1
00:53:02.989 --> 00:53:05.789
<v Hou, Eric>and then.
But we also know that currently there are</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7229-2
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:07.027
<v Hou, Eric>some turbulence, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7239-0
00:53:07.027 --> 00:53:10.627
<v Hou, Eric>So then created by whoever we we we both
know.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7243-0
00:53:10.667 --> 00:53:12.987
<v Hou, Eric>So then do you still think that?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7252-0
00:53:13.687 --> 00:53:16.799
<v Hou, Eric>Going forward,
we should trust the model suggested</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7252-1
00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:17.287
<v Hou, Eric>numbers.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7270-0
00:53:17.877 --> 00:53:22.363
<v Hou, Eric>Those suggested strategy towards pricing
towards allocation,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7270-1
00:53:22.363 --> 00:53:25.157
<v Hou, Eric>replenishment towards a lot of things.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7277-0
00:53:25.807 --> 00:53:27.887
<v Sam Iosevich>Yeah. So, OK.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7278-0
00:53:28.367 --> 00:53:29.087
<v Sam Iosevich>Very good, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7288-0
00:53:29.087 --> 00:53:32.567
<v Sam Iosevich>So the question was,
what do you do with it?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7282-0
00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:30.037
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7302-0
00:53:32.567 --> 00:53:37.126
<v Sam Iosevich>It's a very similar question like would
these models work the day before,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7302-1
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:37.927
<v Sam Iosevich>before COVID?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7312-0
00:53:38.007 --> 00:53:40.967
<v Sam Iosevich>First of all, I don't believe it's it's.
It's as bad as that.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7330-0
00:53:40.967 --> 00:53:44.193
<v Sam Iosevich>So in in that in.
So let me go back to the to,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7330-1
00:53:44.193 --> 00:53:47.487
<v Sam Iosevich>to the to the COVID case.
In the case of COVID.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7345-0
00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:53.908
<v Sam Iosevich>Here's a situation where any model that
you would have had would have been in a</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7345-1
00:53:53.908 --> 00:53:54.607
<v Sam Iosevich>in a pretty.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7390-0
00:53:55.317 --> 00:53:59.930
<v Sam Iosevich>A pretty bad, pretty bad shape, right?
As you were going through.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7354-0
00:53:58.327 --> 00:53:58.527
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7390-1
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:05.031
<v Sam Iosevich>And then by the way, when it started,
this is when we started to collect</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7390-2
00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:10.692
<v Sam Iosevich>information on things like COVID deaths
by state. And actually, if you remember,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7390-3
00:54:10.692 --> 00:54:13.557
<v Sam Iosevich>that's what actually drove policy, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7410-0
00:54:13.597 --> 00:54:16.916
<v Sam Iosevich>And that's what actually led to, you know,
differences in sales,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7410-1
00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:19.877
<v Sam Iosevich>I'll tell you that around that time we
were working with.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7425-0
00:54:20.687 --> 00:54:23.785
<v Sam Iosevich>With, you know,
alcohol distribution company right in</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7425-1
00:54:23.785 --> 00:54:25.047
<v Sam Iosevich>multi tier system and.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7434-0
00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:27.397
<v Sam Iosevich>And you could have on premise and off
premise.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7471-0
00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:32.424
<v Sam Iosevich>So on premise, which you know,
the bars and so on that went to near zero</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7471-1
00:54:32.424 --> 00:54:38.003
<v Sam Iosevich>off premise shot shot through the roof.
And So what we found was data that would</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7471-2
00:54:38.003 --> 00:54:40.757
<v Sam Iosevich>actually start to to explain that right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7496-0
00:54:40.797 --> 00:54:44.136
<v Sam Iosevich>So when we get to times of high
volatility,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7496-1
00:54:44.136 --> 00:54:49.978
<v Sam Iosevich>you're going to you're going to see
issues with with the accuracy of of your</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7496-2
00:54:49.978 --> 00:54:52.557
<v Sam Iosevich>of your, of your of your forecast.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7507-0
00:54:52.757 --> 00:54:58.557
<v Sam Iosevich>Right. And so you know,
so for some time here, you know?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7517-0
00:55:00.367 --> 00:55:03.047
<v Sam Iosevich>They're not going to be they're not going
to be useful.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7523-0
00:55:03.087 --> 00:55:05.207
<v Sam Iosevich>You mean you could get a situation where
they're not useful?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7536-0
00:55:05.207 --> 00:55:08.767
<v Sam Iosevich>I don't believe that this is going to be
as bad as COVID, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7545-0
00:55:08.767 --> 00:55:11.087
<v Sam Iosevich>But it's going to take some time for you
to understand, right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7558-0
00:55:11.087 --> 00:55:15.412
<v Sam Iosevich>To be able to understand what is actually
are the drivers that you can actually get</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7558-1
00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:16.287
<v Sam Iosevich>into your models.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7565-0
00:55:18.127 --> 00:55:20.607
<v Sam Iosevich>That, that, that,
that help explain what is happening.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7595-0
00:55:21.157 --> 00:55:25.915
<v Sam Iosevich>I believe today things like consumer
sentiment, inflation,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7595-1
00:55:25.915 --> 00:55:32.446
<v Sam Iosevich>there are macroeconomic variables today
that that are there that could that very</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7595-2
00:55:32.446 --> 00:55:36.397
<v Sam Iosevich>much could explain the variability in the
model.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7598-0
00:55:36.467 --> 00:55:37.747
<v Sam Iosevich>Is it going to be perfect?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7600-0
00:55:37.787 --> 00:55:39.347
<v Sam Iosevich>No. Can you?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7612-0
00:55:39.347 --> 00:55:45.347
<v Sam Iosevich>Will you get better as as as we get,
you know, as we go along.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7632-0
00:55:46.837 --> 00:55:50.844
<v Sam Iosevich>Absolutely, it's.
But I don't want to have it give you any</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7632-1
00:55:50.844 --> 00:55:52.677
<v Sam Iosevich>type of rose colored glass.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7655-0
00:55:52.877 --> 00:55:57.506
<v Sam Iosevich>Answer where where I could say there's
something that you could do right now to</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7655-1
00:55:57.506 --> 00:56:02.077
<v Sam Iosevich>account for all of the volatility that
that we're seeing in the in the market.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7686-0
00:56:05.107 --> 00:56:11.134
<v Hou, Eric>And also you said Parker Avery is is
swerving some information and then we do</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7686-1
00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:16.387
<v Hou, Eric>know in this class that we have,
there is a thing called SCC Edgar.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7720-0
00:56:16.387 --> 00:56:19.158
<v Hou, Eric>So that's a sort of like the data,
you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7720-1
00:56:19.158 --> 00:56:23.161
<v Hou, Eric>the public companies reporting their
10K10Q reports for for SEC.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7720-2
00:56:23.161 --> 00:56:28.026
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know if that's a part of data you
guys are using in your tool and then</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7720-3
00:56:28.026 --> 00:56:30.797
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not you just provided any way
to.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7723-0
00:56:30.797 --> 00:56:31.627
<v Hou, Eric>The to your customers.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7765-0
00:56:32.827 --> 00:56:38.130
<v Sam Iosevich>So if from a from a competitor standpoint
it it can be,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7765-1
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:43.149
<v Sam Iosevich>if you're working with a particular
company, the 10,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7738-0
00:56:39.527 --> 00:56:39.687
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7765-2
00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:49.304
<v Sam Iosevich>the 10Q or the 10K can help explain you
why you're there in, in,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7765-3
00:56:49.304 --> 00:56:51.387
<v Sam Iosevich>in in the first place.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7766-0
00:56:51.687 --> 00:56:52.527
<v Hou, Eric>Correct, correct.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7793-0
00:56:52.877 --> 00:56:57.632
<v Sam Iosevich>But in terms of the type of of data that
we're working with, it's, you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7793-1
00:56:57.632 --> 00:57:02.077
<v Sam Iosevich>a lot of it is is, you know,
the macroeconomic, we tend to source from.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7811-0
00:57:02.507 --> 00:57:05.307
<v Sam Iosevich>From Fred,
you know there's there's there's other</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7811-1
00:57:05.307 --> 00:57:08.947
<v Sam Iosevich>companies like Privateer and Moody's,
which actually have which.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7836-0
00:57:08.947 --> 00:57:13.482
<v Sam Iosevich>Take that information and then harmonize
that with with other countries</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7836-1
00:57:13.482 --> 00:57:18.331
<v Sam Iosevich>information you know to make it easier
for you to, for example, to have a A,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7836-2
00:57:18.331 --> 00:57:20.787
<v Sam Iosevich>you know, global projections and so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7845-0
00:57:22.317 --> 00:57:24.077
<v Sam Iosevich>We, we, we, we we scrape.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7862-0
00:57:24.317 --> 00:57:29.554
<v Sam Iosevich>We scrape information to understand
things like trends and trends and fashion</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7862-1
00:57:29.554 --> 00:57:31.837
<v Sam Iosevich>what's happen, competitor pricing.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7902-0
00:57:33.107 --> 00:57:37.581
<v Sam Iosevich>That that we actually do do ourselves and
sometimes sometimes partner with,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7902-1
00:57:37.581 --> 00:57:42.055
<v Sam Iosevich>and sometimes we actually partner with
with companies like for instanceite,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7902-2
00:57:42.055 --> 00:57:45.587

<v Sam Iosevich>Forecasts, you know, so on.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7934-0
00:58:05.367 --> 00:58:06.247
<v Hou, Eric>Got it, got it.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7948-0
00:58:06.647 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, yeah,
the 10K10Q data has a lot of limitations</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7948-1
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.567
<v Hou, Eric>because they only provide you some.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7949-0
00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:12.647
<v Hou, Eric>Something already happened.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7986-0
00:58:12.647 --> 00:58:16.627
<v Hou, Eric>And then you know the manager is gonna
give you some opinion like. Well,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7986-1
00:58:16.627 --> 00:58:20.934
<v Hou, Eric>they think that what gonna happen in the
in the coming time and no one really.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7986-2
00:58:20.934 --> 00:58:25.186
<v Hou, Eric>Well except for the Wall Street. Right.
So they're gonna impact reflect those</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7986-3
00:58:25.186 --> 00:58:27.367
<v Hou, Eric>information in their stock price but no.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/7998-0
00:58:27.367 --> 00:58:31.687
<v Hou, Eric>One really check their their opinions
whether it holds to be right.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8006-0
00:58:32.397 --> 00:58:33.477
<v Hou, Eric>From from a year later.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8015-0
00:58:33.477 --> 00:58:35.967
<v Hou, Eric>So that's,
that's the definitely the limitation of</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8015-1
00:58:35.967 --> 00:58:36.797
<v Hou, Eric>using those data.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8036-0
00:58:38.307 --> 00:58:40.801
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions from the students?
I you know,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8036-1
00:58:40.801 --> 00:58:44.347
<v Hou, Eric>Sam value your time is already 636,
so maybe one last question.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8042-0
00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:46.557
<v Hou, Eric>One last question.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8049-0
00:58:46.557 --> 00:58:50.277
<v Hou, Eric>Could be easier any any summer interns
for Marquette students?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8062-0
00:58:51.927 --> 00:58:57.887
<v Sam Iosevich>So. So by the way it's, I mean, are,
are we talking about second years or?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8065-0
00:58:59.717 --> 00:59:00.237
<v Sam Iosevich>So I would say.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8071-0
00:59:02.157 --> 00:59:02.797
<v Sam Iosevich>So for.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8074-0
00:59:02.317 --> 00:59:03.557
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, we have this.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8081-0
00:59:03.557 --> 00:59:05.397
<v Hou, Eric>This is a combination of two classes,
right?</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8104-0
00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:10.746
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have 1/2 of class from
undergrad program and half of the class</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8104-1
00:59:10.746 --> 00:59:15.517
<v Hou, Eric>from grass programs and then Master's
MBAs are are actually here.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8106-0
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:17.487
<v Sam Iosevich>Yeah.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8137-0
00:59:19.277 --> 00:59:24.572
<v Sam Iosevich>So you would have here I mean a lot of
the stuff you would have heard heard</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8137-1
00:59:24.572 --> 00:59:27.846
<v Sam Iosevich>already,
hopefully around the importance of of</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8137-2
00:59:27.846 --> 00:59:31.677
<v Sam Iosevich>internships and experience with, with,
with companies.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8149-0
00:59:31.677 --> 00:59:37.563
<v Sam Iosevich>Some of this doesn't even have to be,
you know, official official experience,</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8149-1
00:59:37.563 --> 00:59:38.317
<v Sam Iosevich>right? So.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8165-0
00:59:40.157 --> 00:59:43.929
<v Sam Iosevich>You know,
we we sometimes get involved with doing</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8165-1
00:59:43.929 --> 00:59:46.117
<v Sam Iosevich>projects with people who are.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8170-0

<v Sam Iosevich>That could be kind of.</v>

15c488b7-e6c9-4620-9497-f471ba57d88d/8210-0
00:59:50.197 --> 00:59:53.625
