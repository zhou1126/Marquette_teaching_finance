<v Brozynski, Jaden>Awesome. Well, hey everyone.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/554-0
00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:23.308
<v Brozynski, Jaden>We are.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/573-0
00:06:24.908 --> 00:06:29.681
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Andrew Jaden, Christian and Chris,
and we're excited to share our AI in</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/573-1
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.868
<v Brozynski, Jaden>finance final project from April.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/616-0
00:06:33.468 --> 00:06:37.218
<v Brozynski, Jaden>And Mark university.
So welcome to predicting stock closing</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/616-1
00:06:37.218 --> 00:06:40.905
<v Brozynski, Jaden>prices. With LSTM,
we set out to predict the daily closing</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/616-2
00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:45.905
<v Brozynski, Jaden>price of JP Morgan Chase stock or JPM,
which is tough because prices shift with</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/616-3
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:49.468
<v Brozynski, Jaden>market changes using machine learning
model called LSTM.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/631-0
00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:53.498
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Aim to make accurate predictions to help
investors.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/636-0
00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:57.058
<v Brozynski, Jaden>So let's dive into how we did it and what
we found.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/638-0
00:06:59.578 --> 00:06:59.858
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/680-0
00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:06.348
<v Brozynski, Jaden>So our problem was to predict JP Morgan
Chase's daily closing prices,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/680-1
00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:11.050
<v Brozynski, Jaden>which is tricky because stock prices
fluctuate a lot due to market changes.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/680-2
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.999
<v Brozynski, Jaden>We used machine learning to see if we
could make accurate predictions comparing</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/680-3
00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:20.268
<v Brozynski, Jaden>economic data like interest rates with
technical data like moving a.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/697-0
00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:25.899
<v Brozynski, Jaden>This matters because predictions can help
investors decide when to buy or sell JPM</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/697-1
00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:26.258
<v Brozynski, Jaden>stock.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/706-0
00:07:26.298 --> 00:07:29.618
<v Brozynski, Jaden>We measured success with metrics like
RMSE, Mae.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/714-0
00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:32.028
<v Brozynski, Jaden>5% tolerance accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/722-0
00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:35.538
<v Brozynski, Jaden>And direction accuracy to see how close
we got.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/743-0
00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:44.422
<v Brozynski, Jaden>We chose JPM Chase because it's a $500
billion market cap bank with a huge</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/743-1
00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:48.238
<v Brozynski, Jaden>impact and millions of its shares are
traded daily.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/755-0
00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:52.118
<v Brozynski, Jaden>So even a 1% prediction edge can mean big
profits.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/785-0
00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:57.168
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Our project scope was to build machine
learning models using Lstms which are</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/785-1
00:07:57.168 --> 00:08:01.604
<v Brozynski, Jaden>perfect for time series like stock data
to predict jpm's daily prices.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/785-2
00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:04.478
<v Brozynski, Jaden>We compare 2 models,
one using economic data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/787-0
00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:06.388

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:15.701
<v Brozynski, Jaden>And another mixing economic and technical
data using 10 years of daily data from</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/833-1
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.457
<v Brozynski, Jaden>2015 to 2025,
we had to preprocess this data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/833-2
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:25.988
<v Brozynski, Jaden>create features and evaluate accuracy
with metrics like RMSE to see what worked</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/833-3
00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:26.968
<v Brozynski, Jaden>best for us.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/835-0
00:08:30.308 --> 00:08:30.908
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/837-0
00:08:31.338 --> 00:08:31.538
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/877-0
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:37.711
<v Vargas, Cristian>Yes.
So talking more about how we prepared our</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/877-1
00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:42.189
<v Vargas, Cristian>data,
we pull about 2593 trading days of JP</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/877-2
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:49.008
<v Vargas, Cristian>Morgan stock data from 2015 to 2025 using
Yahoo's finance library.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/893-0
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:55.499
<v Vargas, Cristian>We also grab seven daily economical
indicators like treasury rates and the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/893-1
00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:57.968
<v Vargas, Cristian>fix index from the thread API.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/897-0
00:08:58.948 --> 00:08:59.268
<v Vargas, Cristian>To capture.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/904-0
00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:03.068
<v Vargas, Cristian>Kind of the broader market picture and
then we calculated.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/911-0
00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:07.538
<v Vargas, Cristian>Can you go indicators like moving average
and stochastic?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/954-0
00:09:09.628 --> 00:09:13.492
<v Vargas, Cristian>K also to spot more of like the trends in
the momentum.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/954-1
00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:19.013
<v Vargas, Cristian>So if the stock merging all all this by
date was tricky because we had a couple</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/954-2
00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Vargas, Cristian>of missing days,
but we ended up with 555 engineering</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/954-3
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.948
<v Vargas, Cristian>features to feed into our model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/956-0
00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:27.228
<v Vargas, Cristian>We go to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/978-0
00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:33.695
<v Vargas, Cristian>Yeah. So on this slide,
we're basically highlighting our key</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/978-1
00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:37.187
<v Vargas, Cristian>features,
which is technical indicators on the top</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/978-2
00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:37.598
<v Vargas, Cristian>right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/996-0
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:41.383
<v Vargas, Cristian>Well,
we also have economic variables like</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/996-1
00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:45.518
<v Vargas, Cristian>treasury rates and VIX are in the bottom
right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1010-0
00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:52.805
<v Vargas, Cristian>We found that like features like
yesterday's price are super important for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1010-1
00:09:52.805 --> 00:09:54.118
<v Vargas, Cristian>lstm's because.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1019-0
00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.948
<v Vargas, Cristian>They help models like spot trends in time
series data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1023-0
00:09:58.308 --> 00:09:59.788
<v Vargas, Cristian>You can see in this graph.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1061-0
00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:04.001
<v Vargas, Cristian>Of JP Morgan's closing price from 2016 to
2024,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1061-1
00:10:04.001 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Vargas, Cristian>which also shows Roland statistics like
moving average, and it's 'cause.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1061-2
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:15.347
<v Vargas, Cristian>These features are key to our improved
model success with technical indicators</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1061-3
00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:17.138
<v Vargas, Cristian>showing hiker relations.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1066-0
00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:20.968
<v Vargas, Cristian>With like the EMA and the closing price.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1069-0
00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:23.578
<v Vargas, Cristian>You can go to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1071-0
00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:24.358
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1085-0
00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>All right. So yeah,
I'll talk a little bit about our model</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1085-1
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.738
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>architecture on the right side.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1114-0
00:10:33.738 --> 00:10:36.845
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>You're gonna see the LSTM code that we
actually made,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1114-1
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:40.872
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>but just to kind of breakdown what a long
short term memory model is,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1114-2
00:10:40.872 --> 00:10:42.138
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>that's what an LCM is.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1130-0
00:10:42.138 --> 00:10:47.298
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It's kind of a tool that just analyzes
past trends to help predict future stocks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1156-0
00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:51.566
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Now this is also by using things called
memory cells to track the patterns and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1156-1
00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:55.726
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>then epochs as which are referred to as
these training rounds where it actually</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1156-2
00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:57.338
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>learns from the data over time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1198-0
00:10:58.048 --> 00:11:03.374
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So another area that you'll see in our
model is we used A2 layer LSTM with 50</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1198-1
00:11:03.374 --> 00:11:09.042
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>and 25 units and the reason being we did
this was kind of just to capture both the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1198-2
00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:13.208
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>short and the long term trends in the
price or in the stock.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1218-0
00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:20.248
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Data in general and then we added a
dropout rate of .3 and AL two regular.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1229-0
00:11:20.248 --> 00:11:25.208
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I always have trouble saying this
regularization with the Lambada of 0.03.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1237-0
00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.818
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>What these are is it pretty much just
allows to prevent for over fitting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1258-0
00:11:29.528 --> 00:11:33.349
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>But it's also important for keeping the
model from any like learning noise or any</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1258-1
00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:34.328
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>disruptive variables.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1302-0
00:11:34.888 --> 00:11:37.876
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And lastly,
we use something called an atom optimizer</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1302-1
00:11:37.876 --> 00:11:42.302
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>with early stopping within the for 50
epochs and with that is just more for the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1302-2
00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:45.954
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>training for training efficiently and if
we want to scale things.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1302-3
00:11:45.954 --> 00:11:49.938
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>If it's learning at a quicker rate,
we can always decrease that and it.</v>

00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:54.557
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Was able we scaled all of our features
using between zero and one using</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1318-1
00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:55.648
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>something called.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1326-0
00:11:56.418 --> 00:11:57.178
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Min Max scaler.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1332-0
00:11:57.178 --> 00:11:59.538
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And that's just to kind of help better
enhance the performance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1337-0
00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:02.688
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So you can move on to the next one.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1380-0
00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:10.224
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So kind of looking at our training
history, difference on the top,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1380-1
00:12:10.224 --> 00:12:14.636
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>what you're gonna see is the economic
variable, the economic variables,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1380-2
00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:19.538
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>plus the stochastic K and on the bottom,
the improved LSTM is actually just the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1380-3
00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.438
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>ones using economic indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1408-0
00:12:22.898 --> 00:12:27.566
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>But what we can see is the one
specifically with just technical</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1408-1
00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:32.599
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>indicators did much better with
validation lapse dropping between 0.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1408-2
00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:35.298
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>1 and stabilizing by about 17 epochs.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1437-0
00:12:35.648 --> 00:12:39.959
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And then the economic only model,
you can see it actually struggling a lot</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1437-1
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:44.501
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>more even with the stochastic a helping
with you know its momentum variability</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1437-2
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.168
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>because like we see on daily.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1451-0
00:12:47.778 --> 00:12:51.008
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>On daily moving data specifically for
economic variables,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1451-1
00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:53.458
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>they need some type of momentum
indication.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1458-0
00:12:55.498 --> 00:12:57.058
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And you can see kind of it lost.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1465-0
00:12:57.058 --> 00:12:59.418
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It didn't really do the best tree Crest a
lot.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1481-0
00:12:59.418 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Slowly, only hitting a .
1 after a 30 epochs and its validation</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1481-1
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.378
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>lost kind of fluctuated around .2.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1513-0
00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:10.890
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And that kind of showed us that, you know,
these technical indicators are really</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1513-1
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.388
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>things that are showing strong
significance and improvement and accuracy</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1513-2
00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:16.928
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>around the long short term memory
learning patterns.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1520-0
00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:19.728
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And it makes it just more faster and more
reliable.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1525-0
00:13:19.768 --> 00:13:21.968
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So you can move on to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1545-0
00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:29.738
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So what we're gonna look at here is this
is our technical indicator only benchmark.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1569-0
00:13:29.738 --> 00:13:37.227
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So we had trained from 2015 all the way
until about 2023 where we trained from.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1569-1
00:13:37.227 --> 00:13:43.218
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I think this was April of 2023 all the
way until April of 2025.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1586-0
00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:50.185
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>What we can see is root mean squared
error of .038, a mean absolute error of .</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1586-1
00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:50.538
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>029.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1596-0
00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:54.418
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And we did something called a tolerance
accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1606-0
00:13:54.808 --> 00:13:57.208
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I see and pretty much what that is.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1598-0
00:13:55.158 --> 00:13:55.358
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1617-0
00:13:57.208 --> 00:14:00.808
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Is it measures the percent of prediction
that fall within a certain range?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1631-0
00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:05.168
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So the reason we did this was to kind of
in our case it was a 5% range.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1665-0
00:14:05.248 --> 00:14:09.117
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So what we wanted to do is we want to see
how it was in that range at first and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1665-1
00:14:09.117 --> 00:14:12.405
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>then kind of improve on it moving forward
compared to actual price.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1665-2
00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:15.984
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And then that way we could just see how
the model actually interacts with</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1665-3
00:14:15.984 --> 00:14:17.338
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>interacts within that range.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1676-0
00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:20.968
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And then as we continue to move forward,
we see how the accuracy gets better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1685-0
00:14:21.738 --> 00:14:23.898
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And then our directional accuracy, so.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1691-0
00:14:24.568 --> 00:14:25.968
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It was kind of underperforming.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1727-0
00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:29.884
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It was only 51% accurate and what we're
going to probably try to do is add more</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1727-1
00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>momentum base or even sentiment based
data to try to kind of fix those</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1727-2
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.178
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>directions and get it a little bit closer
to where we need to be. So you can.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1730-0
00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:38.288
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Go to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1742-0
00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:41.788
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So now this is our economic only
benchmark.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1749-0
00:14:41.788 --> 00:14:43.708
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>You can see there's a significant
difference.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1756-0
00:14:44.188 --> 00:14:47.588
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Our rude mean squared error was the .36.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1770-0
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:51.668
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Our mean absolute error was 29,
which is pretty bad.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1798-0
00:14:51.668 --> 00:14:54.720
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I mean,
you can see by the chart and even the 5%</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1798-1
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.579
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>tolerance accuracy fell within a 6%
accuracy and our directional accuracy was</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1798-2
00:14:59.579 --> 00:14:59.828
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>47%.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1820-0
00:15:00.388 --> 00:15:04.713
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>This is just again, just more of a visual.
When we look side by side in comparison</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1820-1
00:15:04.713 --> 00:15:08.778
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>to how these actual technical indicators
work versus our economic indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1860-0
00:15:09.088 --> 00:15:14.045
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>You can see that it really doesn't
perform the best and that you know there</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1860-1
00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:18.220
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>are economic variables that can help a
lot. Even though we had,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1860-2
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.590
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I think the highest percent correlation
we saw to close price was,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1860-3
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.178
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I think one of the the Treasury bills,
which was only.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1889-0
00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:28.691
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Like 50%,
but then you could see on the other ones</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1889-1
00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:31.204
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>with higher correlations like closer to
99 to 98%.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1889-2
00:15:31.204 --> 00:15:34.900
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>These are ones that actually make the
true difference when we're trying to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1889-3
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.688

<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Yeah.
So some challenges that we faced was the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1941-1
00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:34.978

00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:40.585
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So when I was pulling both from Fred and

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1980-1
00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:45.343
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>and from the Wi-Fi ***** import,
we noticed that our economic variables</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/1980-2
00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:50.498

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:01.939
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>we wanna make sure we didn't introduce
any bias or put any, you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2022-2
00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:05.864
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>misinform or like misdata inputs 'cause
that can actually mess a lot with our</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2022-3
00:17:05.864 --> 00:17:08.178
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>accuracy of our model and more so on the
REL.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2024-0
00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:08.928
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Side.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2039-0
00:17:10.418 --> 00:17:13.859
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Another thing is is another challenge was
our long short term memory models are</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2039-1
00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:14.978
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>really sensitive to scale.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2053-0
00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:18.694
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So you know the fitting and the training
of the models with all the variables were</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2053-1
00:17:18.694 --> 00:17:19.098
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>difficult.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2070-0
00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:23.409
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So what we had to do was rather than
using like these fifty to 60 or these 40</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2070-1
00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:26.338
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>to 50 different variables,
we try to narrow it down.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2097-0
00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:31.383
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>On to only using 10 to 15 of them,
the highest amount of correlation and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2097-1
00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:36.248
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>then another thing was is the economic
variable didn't use any trend base.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2138-0
00:17:36.248 --> 00:17:39.993
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So that's why we try to use our
stochastic to kind of help with that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2138-1
00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:42.435
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>momentum shift.
But even with that variable,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2138-2
00:17:42.435 --> 00:17:45.312
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>it still really didn't do much for the
model itself.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2138-3
00:17:45.312 --> 00:17:49.328
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>As you can see with the big you know
price gaps that you saw in accuracy,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2138-4
00:17:49.328 --> 00:17:50.088
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>another thing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2164-0
00:17:50.088 --> 00:17:53.631
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Too is overfitting the models and that's
why that training loss is really</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2164-1
00:17:53.631 --> 00:17:56.648
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>important because that's kind of how we
see whether or not or.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2186-0
00:17:56.808 --> 00:18:01.574
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>How the model is training over time
through those epoch tests and then</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2186-1
00:18:01.574 --> 00:18:04.528
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>finding the right daily economic
variables?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2214-0
00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:07.400
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>A lot of like the main variables that you
want to look at,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2214-1
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.377
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>it's difficult on a daily basis because
there's only so many.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2214-2
00:18:10.377 --> 00:18:14.170
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>But if you want to look at it like the
ones that are more important or more on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2214-3
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.378
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>those quarterly to yearly basis that we
want.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2229-0
00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:19.782
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>To look at so those would be kind of
better if you're trying to predict</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2229-1
00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:22.288
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>something like maybe line items in an
earnings call.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2238-0
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.538
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Just because you get that variability on
that quarter to quarter basis.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2244-0
00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:27.698
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>You can go to the next slide.</v>

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:32.809
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>What we learned,
and this was really cool project I've</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2258-1
00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:33.618
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>worked with these.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2262-0
00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:34.858
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>We've all worked with these.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2295-0
00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:38.484
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I do this a little bit with work,
but we also got to see the testing</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2295-1
00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:42.636
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>various data types can significantly
impact your accuracy like we were able to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2295-2
00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:46.578
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>see between the economic indicators and
the technical analysis indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2316-0
00:18:46.738 --> 00:18:50.336
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Another thing too is long short term
models can be really helpful tools for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2316-1
00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:51.378
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>traders in this sense.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2333-0
00:18:51.378 --> 00:18:54.580
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>For stock price prediction,
it's not necessarily something that you</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2333-1
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.546
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>should fully rely on,
but it is used as a tool so you can sign</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2333-2
00:18:57.546 --> 00:18:59.618
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>it kind of see the directionality of
where.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2349-0
00:18:59.728 --> 00:19:04.128
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>You know, to buy or sell assets at time.
Other thing too is going into it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2373-0
00:19:04.128 --> 00:19:07.505
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>AI models are not foolproof.
Models can make big mistakes and swing</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2373-1
00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:10.335
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>some volatility,
especially if you can't totally account</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2373-2
00:19:10.335 --> 00:19:12.768
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>or have the right variables to measure
for them.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2388-0
00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:17.658
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Coding these models are a lot harder than
like people think.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2424-0
00:19:17.778 --> 00:19:21.430
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I remember when we first started this
project like I we had scraped through a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2424-1
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.568
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>bunch of different GitHub accounts to try
to figure out, you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2424-2
00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>where was a good basis to start.
But some models are depreciated over time</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2424-3
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.578
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>and don't have updated packages.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2454-0
00:19:29.808 --> 00:19:33.318
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And things, but also too.
It was like a lot of trial and error with</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2454-1
00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:36.621
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>trying to figure out, you know,
what was the best fit for what?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2454-2
00:19:36.621 --> 00:19:39.253
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>The variables that we were using.
And then lastly,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2454-3
00:19:39.253 --> 00:19:42.298
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>this can also be applied to a lot of
other topics, so you.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2487-0
00:19:42.298 --> 00:19:46.642
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Can use this of even you can use not only
just numerical variables,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2487-1
00:19:46.642 --> 00:19:51.241
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>but you can also try to use categorical
variables and do something like</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2487-2
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:55.968
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>predicting you know predicting loan
defaults, credit risk, various other.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2492-0
00:19:56.698 --> 00:19:58.538
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Different type of areas of prediction.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2495-0
00:19:59.258 --> 00:20:00.858
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And in the last slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2524-0
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:07.188
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So the next steps is implement a like a
layer stack for reoccurring neural</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2524-1
00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:10.115
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>network.
For more of that pattern recognition to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2524-2
00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:11.788
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>try to improve the accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2529-0
00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:14.868
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Another thing too is feature selection.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2544-0
00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:17.494
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So maybe just add like a sentiment
analysis,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2544-1
00:20:17.494 --> 00:20:21.988
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>a rolling sentiment analysis to try to
help more with those momentum swings?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2574-0
00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:26.656
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I would like to back test it just to see
how it would or how it went act,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2574-1
00:20:26.656 --> 00:20:31.132
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>maybe in a shorter time frame because it
seemed like for those first years it had</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2574-2
00:20:31.132 --> 00:20:34.461
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>a lot closer accuracy.
And then lastly we're going to try to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2574-3
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:36.098
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>implement like forecasting so.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2591-0
00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:40.756
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Forward-looking without any so like
forward-looking from today's dates April</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2591-1
00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:41.058

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2598-0
00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:44.058
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So maybe trying to go 10 days in advance
to see how the forecast looks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2602-0
00:20:45.508 --> 00:20:46.468

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2618-0
00:20:50.908 --> 00:20:55.350
<v Hou, Eric>For a matter of fact,
you guys still have like 42nd anything to</v>

00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:19.598
<v Hou, Eric>So then I understand you're just
predicting daily close price,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2663-1
00:21:19.598 --> 00:21:23.898
<v Hou, Eric>so that if I ask you guys to make it a
real time trading tool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2670-0
00:21:23.978 --> 00:21:26.778
<v Hou, Eric>What is the top three?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2666-0
00:21:24.498 --> 00:21:24.698
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2684-0
00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:31.925
<v Hou, Eric>Difficulties that you feel you're gonna
this this call is gonna feel gonna gonna</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2684-1
00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:32.148
<v Hou, Eric>face.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2728-0
00:21:35.008 --> 00:21:39.874
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Probably the most difficult area I would
say is going to be kind of going back</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2728-1
00:21:39.874 --> 00:21:44.863
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>through and engineering the sides of like
what indicates is buy and sell because</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2711-0
00:21:44.778 --> 00:21:45.218
<v Hou, Eric>The.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2728-2
00:21:44.863 --> 00:21:47.943
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>that like as we narrowed it down to 15
variables,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2728-3
00:21:47.943 --> 00:21:50.468
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>one thing that we could do is kind of do.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2762-0
00:21:50.468 --> 00:21:54.253
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Like a PCA component where we actually
look out of those 15 variables that apply</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2737-0
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:52.848
<v Hou, Eric>Other.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2762-1
00:21:54.253 --> 00:21:56.449
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>to it,
we can pick like four or five that will</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2748-0
00:21:55.528 --> 00:21:55.728
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2762-2
00:21:56.449 --> 00:22:00.234
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>move the most and those are the ones that
indicate whether we're going to buy or</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2762-3
00:22:00.234 --> 00:22:00.888
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>sell an asset.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2772-0
00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:05.068
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Another thing too though,
if we're going to do it on a trade.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2802-0
00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:10.344
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Rating basis. I feel like it depends.
If you wanna do daily or if you wanna do</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2802-1
00:22:10.344 --> 00:22:13.684
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>like minute based almost like a high
frequency style.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2802-2
00:22:13.684 --> 00:22:17.456
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>With this model you'll it'll still
struggle on a lower time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2802-3
00:22:17.456 --> 00:22:20.858
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It could do well on a lower time basis
but the only I.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2820-0
00:22:20.858 --> 00:22:22.546
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Mean the only issue we're gonna see is
like,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2820-1
00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:25.098
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>how are we gonna scale and rework in
feature engineer all the data?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2826-0
00:22:25.098 --> 00:22:27.138
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I feel like that would be a really big
difficult area.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2849-0
00:22:29.628 --> 00:22:32.733
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Especially on the economic side,
because there's no really like time like</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2849-1
00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:35.628
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>5 minute or one minute based economic
indicators that we can really.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2851-0
00:22:35.898 --> 00:22:36.738
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Use.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2855-0
00:22:37.658 --> 00:22:38.018
<v Hou, Eric>Great.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2864-0
00:22:39.068 --> 00:22:40.548
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And then reliability of the backtest too.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2897-0
00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:43.452
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So it's like, you know,
as much as the backtest we can pass we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2897-1
00:22:43.452 --> 00:22:47.185
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>there's also been a lot of issues that
I've seen online where people have in the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2897-2
00:22:47.185 --> 00:22:50.781
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>industry have made notes that there are
certain styles and certain back tests</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2897-3
00:22:50.781 --> 00:22:52.348
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>that you should kind of stay away.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2904-0
00:22:52.348 --> 00:22:54.628
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>From and some some that you should
implement.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2913-0
00:22:54.628 --> 00:22:56.384
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So it's kind of finding the right one for
our model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2913-1
00:22:56.384 --> 00:22:57.908
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>What I would I could see be pretty
difficult.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2916-0
00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:00.658
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds good.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2932-0
00:23:01.218 --> 00:23:06.229
<v Hou, Eric>So then in the next steps you said
implement RN along with long short term</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2932-1
00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:07.298
<v Hou, Eric>memories, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2943-0
00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:11.618
<v Hou, Eric>So then why do you think implementing RNN
will be helpful?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2934-0
00:23:08.148 --> 00:23:08.348
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2957-0
00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:17.508
<v Hou, Eric>Because RNN is usually gonna slow down
your your running time, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2970-0
00:23:17.508 --> 00:23:21.388
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know you eventually wanna
push it to the real time trading.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2960-0
00:23:17.988 --> 00:23:18.188
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2984-0
00:23:21.388 --> 00:23:25.108
<v Hou, Eric>Kind of tool and then adding RNN is not
going to help you, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2980-0
00:23:22.698 --> 00:23:23.258
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2998-0
00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:27.900
<v Hou, Eric>Just going into slow you down South then
I I just wondering like,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/2998-1
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.788
<v Hou, Eric>why do you think RNN?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3006-0
00:23:29.338 --> 00:23:32.178
<v Hou, Eric>Will be a good addition to our our LSTM.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3021-0
00:23:33.168 --> 00:23:37.328
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>I feel like pattern recognition side.
It's kind of just another.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3019-0
00:23:36.628 --> 00:23:36.988
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3025-0
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:38.768
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It's another stack of learning.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3063-0
00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:42.436
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>So even though it is going to take kind
of longer for us to run and that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3063-1
00:23:42.436 --> 00:23:45.617
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>essentially it could get us to the area
where at least we have,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3039-0
00:23:42.638 --> 00:23:42.838
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3063-2
00:23:45.617 --> 00:23:49.195
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>we can stray away from using that
tolerance accuracy and we can go more</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3063-3
00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:50.438
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>direct and get us to the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3067-0
00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:51.328
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Level of higher precision.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3093-0
00:23:52.788 --> 00:23:55.457
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>If I mean grant,
we aren't looking at it necessarily at</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3093-1
00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:59.080
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>the sense of like a trading style,
but it's like we chose a long short term</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3093-2
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.988
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>memory as more of a long term.
But by stacking on top again.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3102-0
00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:05.175
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>And we can kind of get that,
even though it will take longer for us to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3102-1
00:24:05.175 --> 00:24:05.418
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>train.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3110-0
00:24:06.908 --> 00:24:08.148
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>We can get a little bit of more.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3117-0
00:24:08.148 --> 00:24:10.668
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>It's on the push for closer accuracy I
guess.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3124-0
00:24:11.858 --> 00:24:12.938
<v Hou, Eric>OK, sounds good.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3136-0
00:24:12.938 --> 00:24:16.131
<v Hou, Eric>I I just wanna hear your.
Your thought process doesn't have to be</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3136-1
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:17.098
<v Hou, Eric>like right or wrong.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3147-0
00:24:17.098 --> 00:24:20.898
<v Hou, Eric>Just wanna know like how you know how do
you answer your question right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3140-0
00:24:17.798 --> 00:24:18.278
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3151-0
00:24:20.898 --> 00:24:22.098
<v Hou, Eric>So then perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3150-0
00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:21.798
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Mm H.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3156-0
00:24:23.828 --> 00:24:25.388
<v Hou, Eric>One last comment, right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3169-0
00:24:25.388 --> 00:24:31.961
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can there is actually a
transformer based time series prediction</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3169-1
00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:32.388
<v Hou, Eric>tool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3171-0
00:24:33.198 --> 00:24:33.678
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3180-0
00:24:34.028 --> 00:24:35.868
<v Hou, Eric>That you I need to find the name of it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3184-0
00:24:35.868 --> 00:24:37.028
<v Hou, Eric>I totally forgot.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3192-0
00:24:37.188 --> 00:24:41.628
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite new and I think for the
pattern recognition purposes.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3203-0
00:24:42.378 --> 00:24:45.818
<v Hou, Eric>Purposes, I think you gonna help you guys.
This is up to that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3205-0
00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:45.208
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3208-0
00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.098
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely leverage it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3238-0
00:24:48.098 --> 00:24:53.515
<v Hou, Eric>Will it will be using like similar model
that the large language model is based</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3238-1
00:24:53.515 --> 00:24:58.660
<v Hou, Eric>upon and you know the transformer kind of

00:25:09.068 --> 00:25:11.548
<v Hou, Eric>Stock.
But there's something that worth trying.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3288-0
00:25:11.858 --> 00:25:17.212
<v Hou, Eric>This is really something that really new

00:25:18.438 --> 00:25:21.038
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Is it like a bird style transformer that
they use?</v>

00:25:25.778 --> 00:25:26.738
<v Hou, Eric>We tried it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3345-0
00:25:26.738 --> 00:25:31.513
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely help us in predating some
areas, but the issue of that model is,</v>

00:25:34.592 --> 00:25:38.676

<v Hou, Eric>Let's go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3550-0
00:27:40.318 --> 00:27:40.678
<v Schembari, John>All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3555-0
00:27:40.678 --> 00:27:41.518
<v Schembari, John>So hi everyone.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3573-0
00:27:41.518 --> 00:27:44.795
<v Schembari, John>So today we're discussing our final
project,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3573-1
00:27:44.795 --> 00:27:50.038
<v Schembari, John>which ours was a credit risk analysis
using the AI model that we built.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3596-0
00:27:50.278 --> 00:27:54.599
<v Schembari, John>So we designed this project to tackle a
major issue in financial services,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3596-1
00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:57.998
<v Schembari, John>which is how to better predict who will
default on a loan.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3624-0
00:27:58.278 --> 00:28:01.966
<v Schembari, John>So then using machine learning,
we developed a tool that helps lenders</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3624-1
00:28:01.966 --> 00:28:04.614
<v Schembari, John>make smarter,
faster and fairer lending decisions.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3624-2
00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:07.315
<v Schembari, John>And so today,
we're just gonna walk you through our</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3624-3
00:28:07.315 --> 00:28:10.068
<v Schembari, John>journey from the initial problem to the
building of.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3631-0
00:28:10.178 --> 00:28:13.058
<v Schembari, John>The models and then to the insights that
we uncovered from it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3659-0
00:28:15.498 --> 00:28:21.517
<v Haque, Aleema>Yeah. So starting off with our overview,
traditional lending models often focus on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3659-1
00:28:21.517 --> 00:28:26.665
<v Haque, Aleema>static indicators such as credit scores,
financial statements, income,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3659-2
00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:27.898
<v Haque, Aleema>things like that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3681-0
00:28:28.738 --> 00:28:35.263
<v Haque, Aleema>But these models are severely outdated
and run the risk of misclassifying risky</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3681-1
00:28:35.263 --> 00:28:39.178
<v Haque, Aleema>borrowers and unnecessarily denying
applicants.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3695-0
00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:45.426
<v Haque, Aleema>Two people with similar credit scores can
have very different risk profiles based</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3695-1

<v Haque, Aleema>Spending habits,
financial resilience and family</v>

00:28:53.188 --> 00:28:58.468
<v Haque, Aleema>So our goal was to create a or develop.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3728-0
00:29:00.828 --> 00:29:06.388
<v Haque, Aleema>A credit risk analysis model that
improves the accuracy and fairness.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3739-0
00:29:07.908 --> 00:29:13.268

00:29:19.778 --> 00:29:26.538
<v Haque, Aleema>So why this matters in the US alone,

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3766-1

<v Haque, Aleema>Even a minor improvement within the

00:29:40.508 --> 00:29:43.881
<v Haque, Aleema>Additionally,

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3805-1
00:29:43.881 --> 00:29:47.388
<v Haque, Aleema>opportunities to populations that are

<v Haque, Aleema>which would ultimately help businesses

00:29:59.148 --> 00:30:00.188
<v Haque, Aleema>And then finally.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3849-0
00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:06.622
<v Haque, Aleema>It would increase the value because

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:14.784
<v Haque, Aleema>And then also automating risk evaluation

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3868-1
00:30:14.784 --> 00:30:16.988
<v Haque, Aleema>operating costs, which also help.</v>

00:30:20.468 --> 00:30:21.108
<v Haque, Aleema>Finally.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3904-0
00:30:23.148 --> 00:30:29.202
<v Haque, Aleema>The business and financial relevant

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3904-1
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:35.334
<v Haque, Aleema>rates as well as enhances fairness and

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3904-2
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.188
<v Haque, Aleema>compliance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3921-0
00:30:37.298 --> 00:30:42.138
<v Haque, Aleema>Through data-driven models,
there could be competitive advantages</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3921-1
00:30:42.138 --> 00:30:46.098
<v Haque, Aleema>through decision making and reduce manual
processing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3975-0
00:30:49.378 --> 00:30:53.003
<v Schembari, John>Yeah. So for our project,
we chose two sophisticated models,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3975-1
00:30:53.003 --> 00:30:56.093
<v Schembari, John>which was gradient boosting and then
random forest.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3975-2
00:30:56.093 --> 00:31:00.787
<v Schembari, John>And so for this project gradient boosting
it improved each subsequent model to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3975-3
00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:05.065
<v Schembari, John>correct mistakes from the previous ones,
which made it highly accurate,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3975-4
00:31:05.065 --> 00:31:07.858
<v Schembari, John>especially with the like real world data
that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3990-0
00:31:07.858 --> 00:31:11.096
<v Schembari, John>We were using,
which was initially very messy and had a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/3990-1
00:31:11.096 --> 00:31:13.698
<v Schembari, John>lot of gaps in it.
The random forest though.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4000-0
00:31:14.468 --> 00:31:16.828
<v Schembari, John>That builds multiple decision trees and
averages them out.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4002-0
00:31:16.828 --> 00:31:18.228
<v Schembari, John>So it offered a robust.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4055-0
00:31:19.018 --> 00:31:22.272
<v Schembari, John>View of it and then resistance to
overfitting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4055-1
00:31:22.272 --> 00:31:27.950
<v Schembari, John>And then we used a logistic regression
served just serving as our baseline model,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4055-2
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:33.213
<v Schembari, John>and we did this because it's simple and
widely used in traditional finance,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4055-3
00:31:33.213 --> 00:31:37.298
<v Schembari, John>but this lacks the power to capture
complex relationships.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4066-0
00:31:37.298 --> 00:31:42.858
<v Schembari, John>So we thought it'd be a good baseline to
kind of compare with the other models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4077-0
00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:49.598
<v Schembari, John>And so for our data set we used kaggles.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4115-0
00:31:49.598 --> 00:31:54.369
<v Schembari, John>Give me some credit competition,
which was specifically designed to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4115-1
00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:58.789
<v Schembari, John>challenge credit risk modeling and so
this contained over 150,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4115-2
00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:03.209
<v Schembari, John>000 anonymized participants,
which captured a realistic mix of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4115-3
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:06.998
<v Schembari, John>demographic and behavioral and financial
data points.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4122-0
00:32:07.278 --> 00:32:10.838
<v Schembari, John>So some of these things include like the
number of dependents.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4131-0
00:32:11.548 --> 00:32:14.668
<v Schembari, John>Outstanding debt, late payments,
income levels and more.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4156-0
00:32:15.018 --> 00:32:19.400
<v Schembari, John>And so this just allowed us to construct
a more nuanced view of creditworthiness</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4156-1
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.512
<v Schembari, John>and this data set was crucial because it
offered a blend of traditional and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4156-2
00:32:23.512 --> 00:32:25.298
<v Schembari, John>alternative financial indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4177-0
00:32:28.648 --> 00:32:32.145
<v Schembari, John>So preparing our data,
the real world data always presented</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4177-1
00:32:32.145 --> 00:32:35.408
<v Schembari, John>challenges for us. Like I said,
we were missing values.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4184-0
00:32:35.408 --> 00:32:38.368
<v Schembari, John>And so, if ignored,
those could distort the results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4206-0
00:32:38.448 --> 00:32:43.500
<v Schembari, John>So we carefully filled gaps using
statistical imputation like means for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4206-1
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.008
<v Schembari, John>numeric data and then modes for
categorical data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4229-0
00:32:47.288 --> 00:32:52.739
<v Schembari, John>We also conducted correlation analysis
and features that were almost perfectly</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4229-1
00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:57.708
<v Schembari, John>correlated, such as being late,
being 30 days late versus 60 days late.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4250-0
00:32:57.858 --> 00:33:02.706
<v Schembari, John>Were selectively removed and that was
just to prevent redundancy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4250-1
00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:05.938
<v Schembari, John>And then lastly we address class
imbalance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4260-0
00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:08.858
<v Schembari, John>Defaults are rare,
but critical to predict.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4279-0
00:33:08.858 --> 00:33:13.631
<v Schembari, John>And so if we didn't adjust for imbalance,
our models would just always predict no</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4279-1
00:33:13.631 --> 00:33:17.298
<v Schembari, John>default appearing accurate,
but being useless in practice, so.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4301-0
00:33:20.448 --> 00:33:23.379
<v Schembari, John>So then,
while we were building the data after</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4301-1
00:33:23.379 --> 00:33:28.368
<v Schembari, John>cleaning the data and preprocessing it,
we scaled our features for consistency.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4303-0
00:33:28.568 --> 00:33:30.328
<v Schembari, John>So this looks like.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4314-0
00:33:31.828 --> 00:33:33.508
<v Schembari, John>Essential especially for logistic
regression.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4353-0
00:33:33.868 --> 00:33:37.488
<v Schembari, John>We trained 3 models, the random forest,
the gradient boosting,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4353-1
00:33:37.488 --> 00:33:41.797
<v Schembari, John>the logistic regression and to judge them
we didn't just look at accuracy,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4353-2
00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:45.876
<v Schembari, John>we also focused on precision,
recall and F1 scores to measure how well</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4353-3
00:33:45.876 --> 00:33:49.668
<v Schembari, John>the models balance catching defaulters
versus like a false alarm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4371-0
00:33:50.538 --> 00:33:54.485
<v Schembari, John>And then using multiple evaluation
metrics gave us a much more honest and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4371-1
00:33:54.485 --> 00:33:57.258
<v Schembari, John>well-rounded view of the model
performance overall.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4399-0
00:34:00.178 --> 00:34:02.997
<v Schembari, John>So here are a few of our like metrics and
results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4399-1
00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:07.253
<v Schembari, John>So as you can see from the numbers,
both gradient boosting and random forest</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4399-2
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:09.298
<v Schembari, John>models achieved outstanding accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4409-0
00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:14.858
<v Schembari, John>Both were very close to 94%,
while the logistic regression.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4420-0
00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:19.828
<v Schembari, John>Being much simpler,
it only achieved a 77 1/2% accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4439-0
00:34:19.828 --> 00:34:24.059
<v Schembari, John>So this just reinforced that the
traditional methods are becoming less</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4439-1
00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:25.668
<v Schembari, John>reliable in modern lending.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4441-0
00:34:26.108 --> 00:34:28.428
<v Schembari, John>However, accuracy isn't everything.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4458-0
00:34:28.738 --> 00:34:32.276
<v Schembari, John>We understand that,
especially with rare events like default</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4458-1
00:34:32.276 --> 00:34:35.698
<v Schembari, John>metrics like precision and recall must
also be considered.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4493-0
00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:41.103
<v Schembari, John>So this bar chart just visually captures
the huge gap between machine learning</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4493-1
00:34:41.103 --> 00:34:45.336
<v Schembari, John>models and traditional models.
And then even though logistic regression</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4493-2
00:34:45.336 --> 00:34:48.922
<v Schembari, John>is faster and easier,
its predictive power was significantly</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4493-3
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:50.098
<v Schembari, John>weaker in this case.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4510-0
00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:53.011
<v Schembari, John>So when lenders need to minimize
financial risk,</v>

00:34:53.011 --> 00:34:56.178
<v Schembari, John>the small boost in accuracy gradient
boosting offers.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4515-0
00:34:56.868 --> 00:34:58.148
<v Schembari, John>Can have a big financial impact.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4523-0
00:34:58.778 --> 00:35:02.058
<v Schembari, John>Over thousands or even millions of loans
being issued.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4541-0
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:10.372
<v Schembari, John>So one powerful advantage of random
forest is that it ranks features by</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4541-1
00:35:10.372 --> 00:35:10.998
<v Schembari, John>importance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4563-0
00:35:11.438 --> 00:35:16.398
<v Schembari, John>So this was interesting because with
credit utilization or how much credit a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4563-1
00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:21.552
<v Schembari, John>person uses compared to what's available
was the strongest predictor of default</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4563-2
00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:22.518
<v Schembari, John>risk. And then?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4591-0
00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:28.954
<v Schembari, John>Features like late payments and high debt
to income ratios were following closely</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4591-1
00:35:28.954 --> 00:35:33.754
<v Schembari, John>and then age also emerged as a moderately
important with younger borrowers carrying</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4591-2
00:35:33.754 --> 00:35:35.068
<v Schembari, John>a slightly higher risk.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4609-0
00:35:35.978 --> 00:35:40.396
<v Schembari, John>So these insights can just guide lenders
toward focusing on the right factors in</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4609-1
00:35:40.396 --> 00:35:41.978
<v Schembari, John>their underwriting processes.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4620-0
00:35:45.308 --> 00:35:48.308
<v Schembari, John>And so some of the prototype outputs.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4637-0
00:35:48.388 --> 00:35:52.446
<v Schembari, John>So after training our models,
we generated risk scores which were</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4637-1
00:35:52.446 --> 00:35:55.828
<v Schembari, John>predicted probabilities of default for
new applicants.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4658-0
00:35:56.018 --> 00:36:00.717
<v Schembari, John>So as you can see,
most risk scores were very low between 0%</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4658-1
00:36:00.717 --> 00:36:04.338
<v Schembari, John>and 5% and most people indeed did not
default.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4698-0
00:36:04.858 --> 00:36:08.743
<v Schembari, John>So this gives lenders actual insights
instead of a yes or no,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4698-1
00:36:08.743 --> 00:36:12.064
<v Schembari, John>like binary choice,
they can see a spectrum of risk,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4670-0
00:36:09.058 --> 00:36:09.498
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4698-2
00:36:12.064 --> 00:36:17.328
<v Schembari, John>allowing for finer grain loan offers and
or credit limits based on individual risk.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4698-3
00:36:17.328 --> 00:36:22.028
<v Schembari, John>And a dashboard like this can just help
speed up loan decision making, Dr.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4718-0
00:36:25.458 --> 00:36:29.787
<v Schembari, John>So some of the challenges while we were
building this model challenges were</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4718-1
00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:30.698
<v Schembari, John>pretty frequent.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4747-0
00:36:30.738 --> 00:36:33.934
<v Schembari, John>Like I've said,
the missing data was one of the most</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4747-1
00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:38.879
<v Schembari, John>major hurdles we had to go over ignoring
it or handling it poorly would have just</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4747-2
00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:42.738
<v Schembari, John>weakened the models and would have led to
a decreased accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4761-0
00:36:43.018 --> 00:36:47.288
<v Schembari, John>So the imbalance between defaulters and
non defaulters also forced us to be</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4761-1
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:47.738
<v Schembari, John>careful.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4767-0
00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:51.338
<v Schembari, John>Otherwise the model would have just
predicted no default like I said.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4777-0
00:36:52.068 --> 00:36:54.868
<v Schembari, John>And then additionally,
logistic regression initially failed.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4782-0
00:36:55.298 --> 00:36:56.458
<v Schembari, John>To converge.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4796-0
00:36:56.498 --> 00:37:01.186
<v Schembari, John>So we had to scale the data properly and
then tweak solver settings to fix this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4796-1
00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:01.538
<v Schembari, John>issue.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4832-0
00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:08.617
<v Myers, Nathan>So now moving into the next steps and
future improvements for our model and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4832-1
00:37:08.617 --> 00:37:11.322
<v Myers, Nathan>risk analysis,
we understand that further iterations</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4832-2
00:37:11.322 --> 00:37:14.538
<v Myers, Nathan>could integrate more data factors.
We can include more models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4844-0
00:37:14.538 --> 00:37:19.658
<v Myers, Nathan>We can fine tune our random forests and
move our hyperparameters around.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4877-0
00:37:19.658 --> 00:37:23.101
<v Myers, Nathan>We figured that hyper moving our
hyperameters around was very,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4877-1
00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:27.363
<v Myers, Nathan>very important on our output and that
sometimes changing the maximum depth of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4877-2
00:37:27.363 --> 00:37:31.298
<v Myers, Nathan>your tree or the number of estimators or
the minimum number of samples.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4881-0
00:37:32.028 --> 00:37:33.548
<v Myers, Nathan>Had greatly changed the output.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4914-0
00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:38.342
<v Myers, Nathan>That we were looking for and completely
changed what loans were worthy and what</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4914-1
00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:40.960
<v Myers, Nathan>weren't,
so keeping a fine eye on that was very</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4914-2
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.378
<v Myers, Nathan>important to what we were doing and we
understand the future that we need to add</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4914-3
00:37:45.378 --> 00:37:48.378
<v Myers, Nathan>biased detection tools,
which I'll get to in a little.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4943-0
00:37:48.378 --> 00:37:54.063
<v Myers, Nathan>Bit and we could explore different models
altogether instead of just tweaking the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4943-1
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:58.154
<v Myers, Nathan>models we have now,
we can look into AK nearest neighbors.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4943-2
00:37:58.154 --> 00:37:59.818
<v Myers, Nathan>AK means we can do some.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4952-0
00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:03.948
<v Myers, Nathan>Rather interesting things such as a
support vector.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4972-0
00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:09.300
<v Myers, Nathan>Regressor and really just look around and
see what models get us the output or</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/4972-1
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.658
<v Myers, Nathan>looking for with the most efficiency and
accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5004-0
00:38:14.148 --> 00:38:18.100
<v Myers, Nathan>So for risk assessment and mitigation,
we figure that we need to gather a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5004-1
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.105
<v Myers, Nathan>greater volume of structured data sets.
If we just work with one data set,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5004-2
00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:24.348
<v Myers, Nathan>our information could be biased or skewed.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5023-0
00:38:24.348 --> 00:38:28.108
<v Myers, Nathan>So when looking for those you really want
to get them from credit bureaus,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5023-1
00:38:28.108 --> 00:38:31.868
<v Myers, Nathan>maybe from the international transaction
records or customer applications?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5030-0
00:38:32.028 --> 00:38:34.868
<v Myers, Nathan>So a couple examples from that would be
maybe.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5053-0
00:38:35.178 --> 00:38:39.244
<v Myers, Nathan>Going through Don and Brad Street,
if you wanna do a commercial loan or</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5053-1
00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:43.818
<v Myers, Nathan>someone of the biggest consumer credit
boroughs in the United States is Equifax.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5057-0
00:38:43.818 --> 00:38:45.658
<v Myers, Nathan>We can look to those datasets as well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5099-0
00:38:45.738 --> 00:38:49.895
<v Myers, Nathan>To get a more nuanced idea of what's
going on with trends in the market,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5099-1
00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:53.711
<v Myers, Nathan>and we should also increase the
extensiveness of data prepossi pre</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5099-2
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:58.153
<v Myers, Nathan>processing as we were stating before,
that was like one of the biggest issues</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5099-3
00:38:58.153 --> 00:39:01.228
<v Myers, Nathan>when running our model was just making
sure the data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5110-0
00:39:01.228 --> 00:39:03.258
<v Myers, Nathan>Was fit to to for the model to run.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5135-0
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Myers, Nathan>So we we should maybe create more outlier
detectors,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5135-1
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.189
<v Myers, Nathan>because sometimes a finger slips and
credit scores are entered in above 800,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5135-2
00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:12.378
<v Myers, Nathan>which is impossible.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5146-0
00:39:12.378 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Myers, Nathan>So we want to be looking out for stuff
like that or credit scores that are below</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5146-1
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:15.738
<v Myers, Nathan>300.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5152-0
00:39:15.858 --> 00:39:17.738
<v Myers, Nathan>So two different thresholds there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5168-0
00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:22.458
<v Myers, Nathan>So we want to be able to get those out of
our data to ensure a greater accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5199-0
00:39:22.858 --> 00:39:27.443
<v Myers, Nathan>We could also create new hyperparameters
with the variables that we already have,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5199-1
00:39:27.443 --> 00:39:31.804
<v Myers, Nathan>like a debt to income ratio that might
yield a better idea of what's going on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5199-2
00:39:31.804 --> 00:39:32.978
<v Myers, Nathan>with debt and income.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5216-0
00:39:32.978 --> 00:39:35.827
<v Myers, Nathan>They are correlated,
but there are a lot of different</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5216-1
00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:40.260
<v Myers, Nathan>scenarios when people enter debt and it's
better to get a understanding of why that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5216-2
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:40.418
<v Myers, Nathan>is.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5251-0
00:39:42.258 --> 00:39:47.125
<v Myers, Nathan>And then moving on to the next slide,
we could also do some risk mitigation by</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5251-1
00:39:47.125 --> 00:39:50.083
<v Myers, Nathan>including the train test split with our
models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5251-2
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:54.888
<v Myers, Nathan>Machine learning tends to memorize,

00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:59.927
<v Myers, Nathan>So putting something there as a benchmark
to make sure that the data isn't just</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5280-1
00:39:59.927 --> 00:40:04.209
<v Myers, Nathan>regurgitating old information and
actually predicting something using the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5280-2
00:40:04.209 --> 00:40:07.218
<v Myers, Nathan>trends that we're getting from the
hyperparameters.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5290-0
00:40:07.948 --> 00:40:11.068
<v Myers, Nathan>The models useless if it's not able to
have any predictive accuracy.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5323-0
00:40:12.418 --> 00:40:16.970
<v Myers, Nathan>Multiple models with different targets
may also yield increased understandings</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5323-1
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:21.407
<v Myers, Nathan>to us by moving those targets around,
we can test each variable and see what</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5323-2
00:40:21.407 --> 00:40:25.498
<v Myers, Nathan>has the greatest influence individually,
and that will yield a better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5338-0
00:40:26.988 --> 00:40:30.428
<v Myers, Nathan>Variable pool for us to use when we run
the actual model in the end.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5349-0
00:40:32.148 --> 00:40:35.268
<v Myers, Nathan>It highlights that a single unchecked
model can get stuck.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5365-0
00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:39.979
<v Myers, Nathan>Only learning and memorizing in that
really covering the bases and being</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5365-1
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:42.948
<v Myers, Nathan>extensive in your report is almost
necessary.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5367-0
00:40:43.098 --> 00:40:43.378
<v Myers, Nathan>Jerry.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5385-0
00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:50.530
<v Myers, Nathan>So for key learnings kind of as a
conclusive, some conclusive points,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5385-1
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.588
<v Myers, Nathan>data cleaning was very critical.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5392-0
00:40:52.588 --> 00:40:53.868
<v Myers, Nathan>There was a lot of missing values.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5401-0
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:58.948
<v Myers, Nathan>There's outliers. If that isn't done,
then your your model is basically useless.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5407-0
00:40:58.948 --> 00:41:00.228
<v Myers, Nathan>It's not going to be accurate.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5420-0
00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:03.569
<v Myers, Nathan>You're going to be giving loans to the
wrong people or denying people who are</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5420-1
00:41:03.569 --> 00:41:05.068
<v Myers, Nathan>worthy loans, which is just as bad.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5422-0
00:41:05.068 --> 00:41:05.868
<v Myers, Nathan>You're losing business.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5445-0
00:41:07.388 --> 00:41:10.563
<v Myers, Nathan>Hyperparameter tuning,
like greatly improved performance and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5445-1
00:41:10.563 --> 00:41:13.947
<v Myers, Nathan>just moving things around and not being
satisfied with just one,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5445-2
00:41:13.947 --> 00:41:14.988
<v Myers, Nathan>one target and 1:00.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5447-0
00:41:15.258 --> 00:41:15.818
<v Myers, Nathan>Output.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5478-0
00:41:17.828 --> 00:41:22.862
<v Myers, Nathan>Will ensure that you make the most money
and avoid the most risk in collaborating</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5478-1
00:41:22.862 --> 00:41:25.625
<v Myers, Nathan>with the code made problem solving way
more,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5478-2
00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:28.388
<v Myers, Nathan>way more fast and it was much more
creative.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5509-0
00:41:28.428 --> 00:41:32.184
<v Myers, Nathan>I I feel our model is a lot more nuanced
and it could have benefit was just one</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5509-1
00:41:32.184 --> 00:41:34.531
<v Myers, Nathan>person,
especially when running into tiny errors.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5509-2
00:41:34.531 --> 00:41:36.785
<v Myers, Nathan>It's nice to have multiple people look it
over.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5509-3
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:40.588
<v Myers, Nathan>You want to cover or each person might
have the one missing piece that you need.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5514-0
00:41:40.588 --> 00:41:41.868
<v Myers, Nathan>For your code to finally run.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5518-0
00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:43.748
<v Myers, Nathan>And that made all the difference.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5520-0
00:41:44.098 --> 00:41:44.978
<v Myers, Nathan>Within this project.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5522-0
00:41:49.398 --> 00:41:49.998
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5526-0
00:41:51.388 --> 00:41:52.028
<v Hou, Eric>I love your project.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5537-0
00:41:54.148 --> 00:41:58.228
<v Hou, Eric>OK, let me set up like 5 minutes Q&amp;A.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5539-0
00:42:00.208 --> 00:42:01.488
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions folks?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5553-0
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:09.328
<v Hou, Eric>As usual, like people do have,
do not have a question, I have questions.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5555-0
00:42:08.548 --> 00:42:09.868
<v Teske, Benjamin>That's a quick, quick question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5577-0
00:42:10.748 --> 00:42:15.148
<v Hou, Eric>OK, #1 questions based upon your data.
Do you consider there there is a year</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5577-1
00:42:15.148 --> 00:42:16.348
<v Hou, Eric>over year difference?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5608-0
00:42:16.348 --> 00:42:20.094
<v Hou, Eric>Because if you train this model on,
for example 2009 data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5608-1
00:42:20.094 --> 00:42:25.238
<v Hou, Eric>so that will be totally different than,
you know 2019 data just because you know</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5608-2
00:42:25.238 --> 00:42:30.127
<v Hou, Eric>just we have we just had a financial
crisis in the 2008 and also like if you</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5608-3
00:42:30.127 --> 00:42:30.508
<v Hou, Eric>train.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5619-0
00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:32.348
<v Hou, Eric>A model in the 2020 we just had COVID.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5626-0
00:42:32.348 --> 00:42:36.268
<v Hou, Eric>So then the default kind of information
gonna be totally different.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5635-0
00:42:36.658 --> 00:42:39.738
<v Hou, Eric>Did you guys consider that kind of factor?
Uh, in your model?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5650-0
00:42:44.738 --> 00:42:50.218
<v Myers, Nathan>So we kind of didn't kind of did the data
span over a very large portion of time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5661-0
00:42:50.218 --> 00:42:53.578
<v Myers, Nathan>So we weren't looking at any data from
like a like a two year period.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5655-0
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:50.718
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5706-0
00:42:53.578 --> 00:42:57.793
<v Myers, Nathan>It was like 20 years worth of data,
so we kind of figured that that would</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5668-0
00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:55.008
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5706-1
00:42:57.793 --> 00:43:02.407
<v Myers, Nathan>implement the the changing trends over
time and kind of with our next steps we I</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5679-0
00:42:59.628 --> 00:42:59.788
<v Hou, Eric>Uh.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5686-0
00:43:01.358 --> 00:43:01.678
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5706-2
00:43:02.407 --> 00:43:06.850
<v Myers, Nathan>included Equifax in my description of
like credit boroughs we can use because</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5706-3
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.388
<v Myers, Nathan>they're gonna give us real.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5710-0
00:43:08.388 --> 00:43:09.418
<v Myers, Nathan>Time credit scores.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5718-0
00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:13.308
<v Myers, Nathan>Like FICO scores and credit reports year
over year.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5739-0
00:43:13.698 --> 00:43:18.032
<v Myers, Nathan>So that that is always gonna be coming in
and that can be implemented in the model</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5739-1
00:43:18.032 --> 00:43:20.538
<v Myers, Nathan>over time.
So it's allowed to learn and change.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5745-0
00:43:21.618 --> 00:43:22.058
<v Hou, Eric>Ah, I see.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5766-0
00:43:22.058 --> 00:43:26.438
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And also the this, this,
this project remind me one of my friends</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5766-1
00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:31.507
<v Hou, Eric>who's who used to work for the federal
government and then she's trying to build</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5766-2
00:43:31.507 --> 00:43:32.258
<v Hou, Eric>her startup.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5784-0
00:43:32.378 --> 00:43:35.176
<v Hou, Eric>So you know,
in the US there is a there is a unique</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5784-1
00:43:35.176 --> 00:43:38.458
<v Hou, Eric>issue is a healthcare there is there are
some people, right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5789-0
00:43:38.458 --> 00:43:39.178
<v Hou, Eric>So then they got sick.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5792-0
00:43:39.338 --> 00:43:41.858
<v Hou, Eric>They they likely they just go broke.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5798-0
00:43:42.138 --> 00:43:46.578
<v Hou, Eric>So then my question is,
you know for some people.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5806-0
00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:49.388
<v Hou, Eric>Were sick and it's sort of like at the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5813-0
00:43:50.338 --> 00:43:51.578
<v Hou, Eric>Charge of being broke.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5837-0
00:43:51.978 --> 00:43:57.458
<v Hou, Eric>How how do you guys use your model to
determine who of those people you want to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5837-1
00:43:57.458 --> 00:44:00.747
<v Hou, Eric>give the second chance to give them some
money?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5837-2
00:44:00.747 --> 00:44:03.898
<v Hou, Eric>Knowing that default risk is relatively
high?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5843-0
00:44:03.898 --> 00:44:06.458
<v Hou, Eric>How do you use that model to to determine
those people?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5846-0
00:44:07.948 --> 00:44:08.588
<v Hou, Eric>The different groups.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5886-0
00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:15.652
<v Myers, Nathan>We could make people in that that fall in
that class the target variable and then</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5886-1
00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:19.872
<v Myers, Nathan>run that against all the other inputs and
see which inputs are common,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5886-2
00:44:19.872 --> 00:44:23.378
<v Myers, Nathan>which ones aren't,
and then run kind of a background check</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5886-3
00:44:23.378 --> 00:44:26.588
<v Myers, Nathan>around those things.
See why that is what's going on.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5884-0
00:44:25.308 --> 00:44:25.508
<v Hou, Eric>Hi.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5906-0
00:44:26.588 --> 00:44:29.275
<v Myers, Nathan>Financially and based off of that,
we could make that decision.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5906-1
00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:32.718
<v Myers, Nathan>I kind of think that's more of a special
case and would require a little bit more</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5906-2
00:44:32.718 --> 00:44:33.138
<v Myers, Nathan>attention.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5914-0
00:44:34.648 --> 00:44:36.008
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. Yeah, certainly.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5931-0
00:44:36.008 --> 00:44:41.294
<v Hou, Eric>Because her point is from an education
perspective, because those are the people.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5931-1
00:44:41.294 --> 00:44:43.808
<v Hou, Eric>Usually, if their income is even lower.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5947-0
00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:46.183
<v Hou, Eric>And then they took a lot of money,
you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5947-1
00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:50.088
<v Hou, Eric>to do the healthcare and then likely they
do not even have any insurance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5960-0
00:44:50.088 --> 00:44:53.279
<v Hou, Eric>So if they got sick for any member of
their family,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5960-1
00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:55.488
<v Hou, Eric>so then just pretty much like broke.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5979-0
00:44:55.768 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Hou, Eric>So then not a lot of programming programs
that are still available to help them</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5979-1
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.788
<v Hou, Eric>understand that the risks of paying back
money.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5986-0
00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:06.378
<v Hou, Eric>In real monthly cadence.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/5996-0
00:45:06.378 --> 00:45:11.578
<v Hou, Eric>So that and and a financial institute
usually just sort of call on call.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6002-0
00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:14.098
<v Hou, Eric>Ignore them without borrowing them
anymore.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6007-0
00:45:14.098 --> 00:45:16.258
<v Hou, Eric>Money for them to start again.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6016-0
00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:19.298
<v Hou, Eric>So that's really a, a,
a social risk right now.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6017-0
00:45:19.298 --> 00:45:20.138
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6044-0
00:45:20.698 --> 00:45:24.931
<v Hou, Eric>So basically your answer is let's just
grab the data and you run a special model</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6044-1
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:29.059
<v Hou, Eric>on those folks and then to understand who
are having a bigger risk and who are</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6044-2
00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.418
<v Hou, Eric>having a smaller risk, OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6048-0
00:45:30.538 --> 00:45:32.058
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6058-0
00:45:32.058 --> 00:45:35.258
<v Hou, Eric>#3 have you guys run this model on your
own data?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6070-0
00:45:36.748 --> 00:45:40.788
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys have a higher risk of a
default, meaning your yourself?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6078-0
00:45:41.428 --> 00:45:43.428
<v Myers, Nathan>Oh,
I haven't ran in against my own crowd yet.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6082-0
00:45:43.748 --> 00:45:45.988
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK. So sounds good.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6083-0
00:45:45.988 --> 00:45:46.388
<v Hou, Eric>All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6086-0
00:45:46.388 --> 00:45:47.228
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you so much.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6093-0
00:45:48.948 --> 00:45:50.788
<v Hou, Eric>Good, good, good, good, good stuff.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6094-0
00:45:50.988 --> 00:45:51.388
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6099-0
00:45:54.628 --> 00:45:56.548
<v Hou, Eric>All right. We are going to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6101-0
00:45:58.738 --> 00:45:59.778
<v Hou, Eric>Group One.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6104-0
00:46:10.108 --> 00:46:10.388
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6106-0
00:46:10.388 --> 00:46:10.948
<v Hou, Eric>You know what?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6108-0
00:46:12.468 --> 00:46:12.908
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6111-0
00:46:15.328 --> 00:46:16.968
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Where it doesn't, there you go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6117-0
00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:20.008
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so you have a recording.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6118-0
00:46:20.528 --> 00:46:20.568
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6121-0
00:46:20.568 --> 00:46:21.168
<v Hou, Eric>I I remember that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6124-0
00:46:21.468 --> 00:46:21.908
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6126-0
00:46:23.188 --> 00:46:24.708
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6133-0
00:46:26.428 --> 00:46:28.388
<v Hou, Eric>Let me set up the time. Are Are you ready?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6147-0
00:46:28.388 --> 00:46:32.288
<v Hou, Eric>Are you ready to present Haroon and and
also that recording? OK,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6144-0
00:46:30.698 --> 00:46:31.058
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6147-1
00:46:32.288 --> 00:46:33.548
<v Hou, Eric>so let me perfect go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6261-0
00:52:10.658 --> 00:52:11.698
<v Severin, Noah>To be on your on mute.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6262-0
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:12.438
<v Hou, Eric>I think you're on your, yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6263-0
00:52:12.228 --> 00:52:12.668
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Sorry.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6303-0
00:52:14.188 --> 00:52:19.959
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So far our data sources we used available
data sets on Kegel and it was the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6303-1
00:52:19.959 --> 00:52:25.882
<v Haroon, Sufyan>cryptocurrency data set which included
financial data on Bitcoin and Ethereum</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6303-2
00:52:25.882 --> 00:52:28.388
<v Haroon, Sufyan>and it was posted by Rahul Singh.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6314-0
00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:32.428
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So we had a fiber focus as they talked
about.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6329-0
00:52:32.428 --> 00:52:39.388
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So we focused from 2018 to 2023 and our
original data set was pretty simplistic.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6333-0
00:52:39.388 --> 00:52:41.628
<v Haroon, Sufyan>It had the open the high, the low.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6340-0
00:52:41.778 --> 00:52:44.498
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Close, close and just.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6348-0
00:52:44.618 --> 00:52:47.098
<v Haroon, Sufyan>They were filtered out through by the
currency type.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6386-0
00:52:47.098 --> 00:52:52.519
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So it was either Ethereum or Bitcoin.
We didn't focus on whole a whole lot on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6386-1
00:52:52.519 --> 00:52:56.758
<v Haroon, Sufyan>other currencies because there is a
reliability issue there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6386-2
00:52:56.758 --> 00:53:02.596
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And I I believe Ethereum and Bitcoin have
the highest market share when it comes to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6386-3
00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:03.778
<v Haroon, Sufyan>cryptocurrencies.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6398-0
00:53:06.148 --> 00:53:09.348
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So as I mentioned,
it was a simplistic data set.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6406-0
00:53:09.348 --> 00:53:12.908
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So we did some,
we added some technical indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6432-0
00:53:13.618 --> 00:53:20.331
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Using Python. So we added the RSI,
the MACD signal, signal line, EMA 20,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6432-1
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:22.538
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Bollinger bands and obv.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6449-0
00:53:25.688 --> 00:53:28.921
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So if someone's unfamiliar with trading
some,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6449-1
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:33.208
<v Haroon, Sufyan>these are some examples of what a bullish
market looks like.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6458-0
00:53:35.308 --> 00:53:37.828
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And what a bearish market looks like for?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6506-0
00:53:40.748 --> 00:53:44.074
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right,
so here's a snapshot of what our new data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6506-1
00:53:44.074 --> 00:53:48.280
<v Haroon, Sufyan>set looks like after doing the adding in
the technical indicators,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6506-2
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.606
<v Haroon, Sufyan>you might see that there are some missing
data sets,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6506-3
00:53:51.606 --> 00:53:56.188
<v Haroon, Sufyan>but in order to calculate those you need
some prior data. So that's why.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6525-0
00:53:56.778 --> 00:54:02.462
<v Haroon, Sufyan>RSI starts after a week,
a week of data and EMA and the Bollinger</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6525-1
00:54:02.462 --> 00:54:06.941
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Band Start.
After almost close to two weeks of data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6525-2
00:54:06.941 --> 00:54:07.458
<v Haroon, Sufyan>there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6572-0
00:54:10.188 --> 00:54:14.159
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So before we dive into our results and
what we found,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6572-1
00:54:14.159 --> 00:54:19.675
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I just wanted to place a disclaimer
because we're only analyzing data from</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6572-2
00:54:19.675 --> 00:54:23.793
<v Haroon, Sufyan>2018 to 2023.
So the results are no longer relevant and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6572-3
00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:28.868
<v Haroon, Sufyan>in current market in the current
situation in the world where there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6579-0
00:54:28.868 --> 00:54:29.428
<v Haroon, Sufyan>A tariff going.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6582-0
00:54:29.428 --> 00:54:30.468
<v Haroon, Sufyan>A tariff war going on.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6593-0
00:54:30.468 --> 00:54:35.428
<v Haroon, Sufyan>It's highly unpredictable to determine
how the trends within the crypto market.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6601-0
00:54:36.148 --> 00:54:39.908
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Are going to be because when government
when.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6618-0
00:54:40.338 --> 00:54:44.085
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Trust in government is low. You see,
there's a high,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6618-1
00:54:44.085 --> 00:54:47.338
<v Haroon, Sufyan>high shift within the crypto markets as
well.</v>

<v Haroon, Sufyan>So for our pre processings we.</v>

00:54:51.868 --> 00:54:56.299
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Use the mean for of throughout the

00:54:56.299 --> 00:55:01.427
<v Haroon, Sufyan>datasets because we didn't want to lose
those precious data points because we're</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6665-2
00:55:01.427 --> 00:55:05.606
<v Haroon, Sufyan>only analyzing data for five years.
While it may seem a lot, but,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6665-3
00:55:05.606 --> 00:55:07.948
<v Haroon, Sufyan>but all the data we want it to be as.</v>

00:55:09.178 --> 00:55:13.098
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So we used used mean to fill out all the
missing data sets.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6692-0
00:55:13.418 --> 00:55:16.418
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Then we split our data set into two.</v>

00:55:16.458 --> 00:55:22.822
<v Haroon, Sufyan>SO12 individually focus on Ethereum and

00:55:27.068 --> 00:55:33.308
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Also use KK Fold cross validation with RK

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6771-0
00:55:33.378 --> 00:55:38.386
<v Haroon, Sufyan>We we chose to use K Fold cross

00:55:38.386 --> 00:55:44.171
<v Haroon, Sufyan>have a reliable model and we didn't want
our results to be based out of chance or</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6771-2
00:55:44.171 --> 00:55:47.698
<v Haroon, Sufyan>based out of how the data set was

00:55:49.308 --> 00:55:56.116
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And we did a 707015 and 15 data split

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6888-1
00:57:11.619 --> 00:57:15.378
<v Haroon, Sufyan>but it's a meme about doing K fold cross
validation for models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6887-0
00:57:14.418 --> 00:57:14.578
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6890-0
00:57:17.248 --> 00:57:17.448
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6933-0
00:57:19.888 --> 00:57:24.108
<v Haroon, Sufyan>For our techniques,
we did logistic regression because it's a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6933-1
00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:27.783
<v Haroon, Sufyan>simple model,
it's lightweight and we could use it as</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6933-2
00:57:27.783 --> 00:57:31.730
<v Haroon, Sufyan>our baseline to compare our findings with
random forests,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6933-3
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:37.175
<v Haroon, Sufyan>we chose random forest for its complexity
and its ability to capture non linear</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6933-4
00:57:37.175 --> 00:57:38.128
<v Haroon, Sufyan>relationships.</v>

00:57:38.208 --> 00:57:44.528
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So there were four models in total,
22 for Ethereum, 2 for Bitcoin one.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/6960-0
00:57:45.258 --> 00:57:50.298
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Logistic regression and one random forest
or target variable was a binary.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7005-0
00:57:50.448 --> 00:57:55.333
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Classification.
So we wanted to predict whether the next</v>

00:57:55.333 --> 00:58:02.104

00:58:02.104 --> 00:58:09.218
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And we did K fold set to five and for our
evaluation we aggregated all the results</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7005-3
00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:12.818
<v Haroon, Sufyan>from the 55 versions and then did our did.</v>

00:58:12.818 --> 00:58:18.154
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Our analysis on those and we also hyper
tuned the both our random forest models</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7022-1
00:58:18.154 --> 00:58:18.688

00:58:22.588 --> 00:58:28.194
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And it took a long time.
It took almost 20 minutes just to run all</v>

00:58:50.341 --> 00:58:54.184
<v Severin, Noah>These are the models that didn't have any

between.</v>

<v Severin, Noah>All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7146-0

00:59:38.748 --> 00:59:39.308
<v Severin, Noah>OK, cool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7158-0
00:59:41.068 --> 00:59:42.868
<v Severin, Noah>All right. So going on to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7162-0
00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:45.348
<v Severin, Noah>These are the hyper tune models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7190-0
00:59:47.028 --> 00:59:51.407
<v Severin, Noah>Very similar in terms of accuracy,
there was a slight accuracy improvement</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7190-1
00:59:51.407 --> 00:59:54.911
<v Severin, Noah>for the Ethereum Brandon Forest model or
a slight decrease.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7190-2
00:59:54.911 --> 00:59:58.006
<v Severin, Noah>Slight increase for the Bitcoin random
forest model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7190-3
00:59:58.006 --> 01:00:00.108
<v Severin, Noah>Logistic regression still struggled.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7197-0
01:00:00.108 --> 01:00:02.628
<v Severin, Noah>You can see here, even for the Bitcoin,
it only predicted.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7201-0
01:00:04.348 --> 01:00:05.228
<v Severin, Noah>All price increases.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7208-0

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:12.698
<v Severin, Noah>So not very useful and just kinda further
supports the random forest.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7227-0
01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:16.348

01:00:18.068 --> 01:00:20.468
<v Severin, Noah>Random Forest obviously outperforms
linear regression.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7246-0
01:00:21.228 --> 01:00:24.708
<v Severin, Noah>Linear regression struggled quite a bit
with Bitcoin as you just saw.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7255-0
01:00:26.508 --> 01:00:28.436
<v Severin, Noah>For us,
hyper tuning did little to improve their</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7255-1
01:00:28.436 --> 01:00:28.908
<v Severin, Noah>performance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7272-0
01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:33.499
<v Severin, Noah>And our Top Model achievement accuracy of
62%.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7272-1
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:36.588
<v Severin, Noah>So while somewhat impressive for a highly
volatile.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7287-0
01:00:37.058 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Severin, Noah>Currency we self out there is a lot of
improvements that we can make to to make</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7287-1
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:41.898
<v Severin, Noah>it better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7330-0
01:00:43.498 --> 01:00:47.976
<v Severin, Noah>So talk about those improvements
introducing more complex indicators like</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7330-1
01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:52.453
<v Severin, Noah>technical indicator crossovers,
which we calculated when those indicators</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7330-2
01:00:52.453 --> 01:00:55.116
<v Severin, Noah>cross certain thresholds across each
other,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7330-3
01:00:55.116 --> 01:00:59.472
<v Severin, Noah>could be introduced as indicators using
Candlestick patterns or rolling</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7330-4
01:00:59.472 --> 01:01:00.138
<v Severin, Noah>statistics.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7336-0
01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:03.408
<v Severin, Noah>Those are all things that could be
calculated using this data set.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7352-0
01:01:04.088 --> 01:01:08.828
<v Severin, Noah>We also could look to introduce outside
variables that are affecting the prices</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7352-1
01:01:08.828 --> 01:01:13.568
<v Severin, Noah>like measure of stock market sentiment or
performance of correlated securities.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7374-0
01:01:13.928 --> 01:01:18.848
<v Severin, Noah>It's often said that Bitcoin and Ethereum
sometimes tend to track the performance</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7374-1
01:01:18.848 --> 01:01:23.408
<v Severin, Noah>of the NASDAQ or other tech stocks,
and then as well as create an indicator</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7374-2
01:01:23.408 --> 01:01:24.008
<v Severin, Noah>dashboard.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7379-0
01:01:24.328 --> 01:01:26.368
<v Severin, Noah>So this would make it more interactive.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7387-0
01:01:27.538 --> 01:01:29.578
<v Severin, Noah>And allow you to see the movement of the
indicators.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7389-0
01:01:30.088 --> 01:01:30.968
<v Severin, Noah>In real time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7424-0
01:01:32.368 --> 01:01:36.839
<v Severin, Noah>As far as how we would scale our solution
as Sufyan talked about before,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7424-1
01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:41.984
<v Severin, Noah>the data quality get switching from daily
to hourly or minute data could improve it</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7424-2
01:01:41.984 --> 01:01:45.843
<v Severin, Noah>as well as some sort of API integration
to get real time data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7424-3
01:01:45.843 --> 01:01:48.538
<v Severin, Noah>We could look at multi user access
turning.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7431-0
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.008
<v Severin, Noah>The notebook into a web app hosted in the
cloud.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7454-0
01:01:52.778 --> 01:01:56.786
<v Severin, Noah>And then in terms of financial strategy,
back testing it on a paper trading</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7454-1
01:01:56.786 --> 01:02:01.058
<v Severin, Noah>platform to see how it would have done
over the past few years and compare that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7459-0
01:02:01.488 --> 01:02:04.168
<v Severin, Noah>To like a benchmark like a treasury.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7467-0
01:02:07.768 --> 01:02:10.168
<v Severin, Noah>All right, quick reflection here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7476-0
01:02:11.048 --> 01:02:14.008
<v Severin, Noah>Random forest. You know,
we we found that to be better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7502-0
01:02:14.248 --> 01:02:18.857
<v Severin, Noah>We found Python to be powerful to
calculate the key metrics we originally</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7502-1
01:02:18.857 --> 01:02:23.715
<v Severin, Noah>were going to use Excel to do that,
and Python made it a lot quicker and then</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7502-2
01:02:23.715 --> 01:02:27.888
<v Severin, Noah>just being patient, as Sufyan mentioned,
took us a while to train.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7512-0
01:02:28.128 --> 01:02:31.442
<v Severin, Noah>Very iterative process.
The code doing the coding and then just</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7512-1
01:02:31.442 --> 01:02:33.048
<v Severin, Noah>be keeping attention to detail.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7514-0
01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:36.018
<v Hou, Eric>A product.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7520-0
01:02:37.738 --> 01:02:40.578
<v Hou, Eric>Me going around folks, any question?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7523-0
01:02:44.298 --> 01:02:46.458
<v Hou, Eric>Alright, questions.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7528-0
01:02:46.898 --> 01:02:48.778
<v Hou, Eric>What are the most important features?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7532-0
01:02:54.528 --> 01:02:55.778
<v Severin, Noah>I don't know if you wanna take that one.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7534-0
01:02:56.028 --> 01:02:56.748
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7538-0
01:02:59.098 --> 01:02:59.178
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7539-0
01:02:59.298 --> 01:03:00.218
<v Severin, Noah>He was more of the data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7562-0
01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:07.089
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right, I'll take this one.
I saw Bollinger Band was was the biggest</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7562-1
01:03:07.089 --> 01:03:09.968
<v Haroon, Sufyan>one and then followed EMA EMA 50.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7569-0
01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.968
<v Hou, Eric>Oh yeah, maybe 50, OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7591-0
01:03:11.328 --> 01:03:18.462
<v Haroon, Sufyan>The Emffe and the Bollinger bands were
highly correlated because we I believe it</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7591-1
01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.928
<v Haroon, Sufyan>also did a feature analysis.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7596-0
01:03:21.288 --> 01:03:23.488
<v Haroon, Sufyan>It's been a long time since we did this
project, so.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7600-0
01:03:25.138 --> 01:03:26.538
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Using the feature.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7624-0
01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:32.422
<v Haroon, Sufyan>From random Forest,
we learned those are the two that were</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7624-1
01:03:32.422 --> 01:03:37.969
<v Haroon, Sufyan>highly involved in predicting being
predicting the next closing days price</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7624-2
01:03:37.969 --> 01:03:39.818
<v Haroon, Sufyan>for Bitcoin and Ethereum.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7627-0
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:41.628
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7639-0
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:46.451
<v Hou, Eric>So then you said your your team has your
team has done some fine tuning kind of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7639-1
01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:46.748
<v Hou, Eric>work.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7642-0
01:03:46.748 --> 01:03:47.748
<v Hou, Eric>Is it a great search?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7654-0
01:03:47.748 --> 01:03:50.908
<v Hou, Eric>Kind of fine tuning or you you're OK.
So great search.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7653-0
01:03:50.858 --> 01:03:51.578

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7659-0
01:03:50.908 --> 01:03:54.668
<v Hou, Eric>So why the great search help one?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7665-0
01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.788
<v Hou, Eric>Crypto, not the other one.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7671-0
01:03:57.188 --> 01:04:00.272
<v Hou, Eric>Any,
any any reason behind it behind the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7671-1
01:04:00.272 --> 01:04:02.228
<v Hou, Eric>scenes or any any thought?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7675-0
01:04:05.448 --> 01:04:06.808
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Interesting question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7677-0
01:04:06.808 --> 01:04:07.128
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So we never.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7688-0
01:04:08.608 --> 01:04:12.648
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Anticipated this question but are on the
top of my head, I would say.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7704-0
01:04:13.888 --> 01:04:18.952
<v Haroon, Sufyan>It's because the volume in Bitcoin was
much higher compared to Ethereum is</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7704-1
01:04:18.952 --> 01:04:20.168
<v Haroon, Sufyan>probably my guess.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7706-0
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:22.088
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Why hyper tuning hub?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7711-0
01:04:23.698 --> 01:04:26.418
<v Haroon, Sufyan>The Bitcoin models to do outperform.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7719-0
01:04:28.058 --> 01:04:30.178
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Improvement and compare to the Ethereum
models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7722-0
01:04:31.058 --> 01:04:31.418
<v Hou, Eric>Got it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7733-0
01:04:31.418 --> 01:04:35.778
<v Hou, Eric>And then you said you have a 70701515
kind of split, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7748-0
01:04:35.778 --> 01:04:39.991
<v Hou, Eric>So then it is a random splitting or it is
it is a?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7748-1
01:04:39.991 --> 01:04:43.378
<v Hou, Eric>It is a splitting by chronological order.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7753-0
01:04:45.438 --> 01:04:46.918
<v Haroon, Sufyan>It's random swelling.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7760-0
01:04:47.048 --> 01:04:49.888
<v Hou, Eric>Also, the random sleeping OK,
so the technically.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7756-0
01:04:47.388 --> 01:04:47.908
<v Severin, Noah>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7779-0
01:04:51.618 --> 01:04:56.062
<v Hou, Eric>You may be grouping some of the Today
data and the five year old data kind of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7779-1
01:04:56.062 --> 01:04:57.658
<v Hou, Eric>together and then that's OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7783-0
01:04:57.738 --> 01:04:58.978
<v Hou, Eric>Gotcha. OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7798-0
01:04:59.618 --> 01:05:04.476
<v Hou, Eric>Last question,
if if I ask you guys each of you,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7798-1
01:05:04.476 --> 01:05:08.938
<v Hou, Eric>it was $1000 based upon your results or

01:05:28.618 --> 01:05:30.860
<v Severin, Noah>Given I I,
I tend to see crypto as something that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7851-1
01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.058
<v Severin, Noah>just essentially tracks the NASDAQ more
or less.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7865-0
01:05:33.058 --> 01:05:38.353
<v Severin, Noah>So I would rather just put my money in
company that's actually generated value,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7870-0
01:05:37.908 --> 01:05:40.268
<v Hou, Eric>But you have a 62% accuracy, Noah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7865-1

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7883-0
01:05:43.218 --> 01:05:45.658

right?</v>

01:06:33.938 --> 01:06:37.418
<v Hou, Eric>I know it's a weird to say that,
but yes it is.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7960-0
01:06:39.888 --> 01:06:41.648

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7973-0
01:06:45.658 --> 01:06:46.538
<v Teske, Benjamin>Can you see this?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7976-0
01:06:47.078 --> 01:06:48.158
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I can see this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7978-0
01:06:48.398 --> 01:06:49.798
<v Hou, Eric>Ready. Ready to go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7981-0
01:06:50.158 --> 01:06:50.638
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yep.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7984-0
01:06:51.068 --> 01:06:51.748
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/7985-0
01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:52.268
<v Hou, Eric>Let's go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8011-0
01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:55.708
<v Teske, Benjamin>Right.
So we are Group 3 and our presentation,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8011-1
01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:59.636
<v Teske, Benjamin>we're going to be analyzing the
relationship between consumer spending</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8011-2
01:06:59.636 --> 01:07:00.908
<v Teske, Benjamin>and purchasing methods.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8019-0
01:07:01.468 --> 01:07:04.119
<v Teske, Benjamin>Sam,
Matt and myself are the three team</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8019-1
01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:05.908
<v Teske, Benjamin>members of our group today.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8034-0
01:07:10.888 --> 01:07:14.888
<v Teske, Benjamin>So we're gonna walk through the agenda
that you laid out for us to go.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8065-0
01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:18.696
<v Teske, Benjamin>So I'll be going over the project
overview and the business and financial</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8065-1
01:07:18.696 --> 01:07:22.760
<v Teske, Benjamin>relevance portion of the presentation.
Sam is going to be talking about the ML</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8065-2
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.568
<v Teske, Benjamin>and AI techniques that we use along with
the data sources and processing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8087-0
01:07:26.768 --> 01:07:30.823
<v Teske, Benjamin>And then Matt is gonna walk through some
of our results as well as next steps in</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8087-1
01:07:30.823 --> 01:07:34.727
<v Teske, Benjamin>future improvements and then I'll talk
about our team reflection slide at the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8087-2
01:07:34.727 --> 01:07:35.328
<v Teske, Benjamin>end as well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8131-0
01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:45.470
<v Teske, Benjamin>So for our project overview kind of our
problem statement is really how different</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8131-1
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:50.243
<v Teske, Benjamin>consumer purchasing locations impact the
amount spent per transaction.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8131-2
01:07:50.243 --> 01:07:55.755
<v Teske, Benjamin>And so the three that we looked at were
when people are making purchases in store</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8131-3
01:07:55.755 --> 01:07:59.318
<v Teske, Benjamin>versus online versus in an app and if
those kind of.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8166-0
01:07:59.318 --> 01:08:02.212
<v Teske, Benjamin>Locations impact how much a user or a
person is spending.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8166-1
01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:06.354
<v Teske, Benjamin>The situation is important because it can
help instruct businesses where to invest</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8166-2
01:08:06.354 --> 01:08:09.098
<v Teske, Benjamin>those resources to influence that
purchasing behavior.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8209-0
01:08:09.888 --> 01:08:14.059
<v Teske, Benjamin>It's really relevant to Business Today
because purchasing behavior is always</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8209-1
01:08:14.059 --> 01:08:16.875
<v Teske, Benjamin>changing.
Obviously with the recent developments of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8209-2
01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:21.155
<v Teske, Benjamin>e-commerce and mobile apps that have
altered purchasing behavior significantly</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8209-3
01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:24.567
<v Teske, Benjamin>over the last decade,
there's a lot more options for people to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8209-4
01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:25.488
<v Teske, Benjamin>buy things today.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8249-0
01:08:26.938 --> 01:08:30.478
<v Teske, Benjamin>So we wanted to explore the relationship
that this has and if like someone is</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8249-1
01:08:30.478 --> 01:08:32.657
<v Teske, Benjamin>shopping in an app on like Instagram or
Tiktok,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8249-2
01:08:32.657 --> 01:08:36.333
<v Teske, Benjamin>if they're spending more money than if
they would be going in store or something</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8249-3
01:08:36.333 --> 01:08:38.058
<v Teske, Benjamin>like that for the same types of goods.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8253-0
01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:39.408
<v Teske, Benjamin>And purchases.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8284-0
01:08:41.768 --> 01:08:46.762
<v Teske, Benjamin>And the scope that were we went through
for the project is number one we analyzed</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8284-1
01:08:46.762 --> 01:08:51.086
<v Teske, Benjamin>and identify a data set with 10,
000 transactions documenting purchase</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8284-2
01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:53.888
<v Teske, Benjamin>location,
amount spent and purchase category.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8301-0
01:08:54.008 --> 01:08:59.663
<v Teske, Benjamin>There were some other things within the
data as well that weren't super relevant</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8301-1
01:08:59.663 --> 01:09:01.688
<v Teske, Benjamin>for our for our problem here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8310-0
01:09:01.688 --> 01:09:04.808
<v Teske, Benjamin>So we kind of ignored some of that or
cleaned it up before we used it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8330-0
01:09:05.168 --> 01:09:08.855
<v Teske, Benjamin>Then obviously we applied the ML and AI
methods that we learned about in class to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8330-1
01:09:08.855 --> 01:09:11.328
<v Teske, Benjamin>detect patterns and identify the
relationship between.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8365-0
01:09:11.888 --> 01:09:15.995
<v Teske, Benjamin>And those purchasing methods and then
finally evaluated the model's performance</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8365-1
01:09:15.995 --> 01:09:18.562
<v Teske, Benjamin>using metrics like MSE and then like I
mentioned,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8365-2
01:09:18.562 --> 01:09:21.848
<v Teske, Benjamin>we'll talk about kind of feature
applications for this as well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8386-0
01:09:21.848 --> 01:09:24.449
<v Teske, Benjamin>But just to recap,
kind of the things that we're looking at</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8386-1
01:09:24.449 --> 01:09:27.787
<v Teske, Benjamin>is how the different purchasing locations
for mobile app in store and online</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8386-2
01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:30.128

01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:36.308
<v Teske, Benjamin>For the business and financial relevance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8426-0
01:09:36.308 --> 01:09:40.599
<v Teske, Benjamin>So why this is important is because the
purchasing experience is rapidly evolving</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8426-1
01:09:40.599 --> 01:09:43.006
<v Teske, Benjamin>and consumer behavior is constantly
changing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8426-2
01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:46.774
<v Teske, Benjamin>If you think before kind of like
computers and stuff like that existed,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8426-3
01:09:46.774 --> 01:09:49.547
<v Teske, Benjamin>everyone was shopping in brick and mortar
locations,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8426-4
01:09:49.547 --> 01:09:52.268
<v Teske, Benjamin>even pre COVID that was really kind of
popular and.</v>

01:09:52.268 --> 01:09:55.348
<v Teske, Benjamin>Just using things like cash, check,

01:09:55.748 --> 01:09:58.908
<v Teske, Benjamin>But now we have so many different ways to
go shopping today.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8460-0
01:09:59.618 --> 01:10:02.349
<v Teske, Benjamin>Through ecommerce,

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8460-1
01:10:02.349 --> 01:10:04.018
<v Teske, Benjamin>so businesses need to understand.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8473-0
01:10:04.448 --> 01:10:08.488
<v Teske, Benjamin>And how they can really benefit from this?
They can adapt their marketing strategies.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8481-0
01:10:08.928 --> 01:10:11.808

01:10:13.538 --> 01:10:15.058
<v Teske, Benjamin>Marketing campaigns and things like that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8497-0
01:10:15.058 --> 01:10:16.778
<v Teske, Benjamin>And maximize their revenue as well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8512-0
01:10:16.778 --> 01:10:21.493
<v Teske, Benjamin>So the businesses that can weaponize this
most effectively will be the best set up</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8512-1
01:10:21.493 --> 01:10:23.538
<v Teske, Benjamin>for financial success in the future.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8541-0
01:10:23.698 --> 01:10:27.429
<v Teske, Benjamin>It also provides a lot of decision making
value for those businesses by</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8541-1
01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:31.420
<v Teske, Benjamin>understanding profitability in different

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.218
<v Teske, Benjamin>understanding where it makes the most

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8585-0
01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:39.956

01:10:39.956 --> 01:10:44.239
<v Teske, Benjamin>more tactfully and giving more detailed

01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:52.635
<v Teske, Benjamin>some of that guesswork.
So allowing them to be more tactical with</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8585-4
01:10:52.635 --> 01:10:53.818

01:10:53.968 --> 01:10:57.348

01:10:57.348 --> 01:10:59.872
<v Teske, Benjamin>and marketing,
advertising investments like I mentioned</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8609-2

01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:04.258
<v Teske, Benjamin>And then finally,
for the operational impact really.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8640-0
01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:08.917
<v Teske, Benjamin>Allows businesses to allocate resources

01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:13.288
<v Teske, Benjamin>especially based on the different product
category that those companies are serving.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8651-0
01:11:13.888 --> 01:11:17.116
<v Teske, Benjamin>Can really help increase operational

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8651-1
01:11:17.116 --> 01:11:18.968

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8691-0
01:11:18.968 --> 01:11:23.706
<v Teske, Benjamin>So if companies should be investing more
resources into their website versus maybe</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8691-1
01:11:23.706 --> 01:11:28.273
<v Teske, Benjamin>into their mobile app or some of their

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8691-2
01:11:28.273 --> 01:11:32.725
<v Teske, Benjamin>they can better spend those dollars in
resources and where they need to spend</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8691-3
01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:35.408
<v Teske, Benjamin>more time developing that specific
technology.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8703-0
01:11:36.888 --> 01:11:39.192
<v Teske, Benjamin>And finally,
tailing those promotional strategies</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8703-1
01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:40.528
<v Teske, Benjamin>based on purchasing location.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8708-0
01:11:40.528 --> 01:11:42.888
<v Teske, Benjamin>So helping build stronger customer

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8735-0
01:11:43.438 --> 01:11:47.437
<v Teske, Benjamin>And earning more repeat customers by

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8735-1
01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:51.184
<v Teske, Benjamin>more happy with their purchase and
getting them to come back and purchase</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8735-2
01:11:51.184 --> 01:11:53.158
<v Teske, Benjamin>through that same Ave. again over time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8769-0
01:11:57.188 --> 01:12:00.474
<v Barbel, Sam>All right,
so getting into the models we used for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8769-1
01:12:00.474 --> 01:12:04.155
<v Barbel, Sam>this project,
we started with linear regression because</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8769-2
01:12:04.155 --> 01:12:08.756
<v Barbel, Sam>it's basic and widely used,
and we use that to predict total spend by</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8769-3
01:12:08.756 --> 01:12:09.348
<v Barbel, Sam>location.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8806-0
01:12:10.808 --> 01:12:15.430
<v Barbel, Sam>Matt will get into all the specific
results for the models later in the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8806-1
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:20.502
<v Barbel, Sam>slides, but it wasn't very accurate.
And then we moved on to utilizing K means</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8806-2
01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:23.648
<v Barbel, Sam>clustering.
We decided on our clusters using the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8806-3
01:12:23.648 --> 01:12:26.088
<v Barbel, Sam>elbow method and the silhouette score.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8817-0
01:12:26.478 --> 01:12:30.461
<v Barbel, Sam>And then we use that to just find any
connections whatsoever between data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8817-1
01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:30.838
<v Barbel, Sam>points.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8867-0
01:12:32.288 --> 01:12:35.575
<v Barbel, Sam>And then after using the K means
clustering,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8867-1
01:12:35.575 --> 01:12:41.493
<v Barbel, Sam>we step it up to a regression tree and
this time we switched up our prediction a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8867-2
01:12:41.493 --> 01:12:47.118
<v Barbel, Sam>little bit and chose to predict location
based on amount spent and category,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8867-3
01:12:47.118 --> 01:12:51.648
<v Barbel, Sam>and then after the using the regression
tree, we went to the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8878-0
01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:56.488
<v Barbel, Sam>I would say the most useful form of model
we use, which is the random forest.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8915-0
01:12:56.878 --> 01:13:01.828
<v Barbel, Sam>And then we use that to predict location
again based on amount spent in category</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8915-1
01:13:01.828 --> 01:13:06.534
<v Barbel, Sam>and our whole philosophy with adding
these different models into the project</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8915-2
01:13:06.534 --> 01:13:10.078
<v Barbel, Sam>was as we learned in class,
the new models more accurate,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8915-3
01:13:10.078 --> 01:13:14.478
<v Barbel, Sam>we decided to implement them towards this
project to hopefully come up.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8919-0
01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:16.198
<v Barbel, Sam>With a more accurate model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8962-0
01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:24.938
<v Barbel, Sam>Our data set we chose was a Kaggle data
set. It had 10,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8962-1
01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:30.367
<v Barbel, Sam>000 data points and each data point
included a customer Ida category of the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8962-2
01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:36.295
<v Barbel, Sam>item which they bought the item itself.
The quantity of items, the price per unit,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8962-3
01:13:36.295 --> 01:13:38.938
<v Barbel, Sam>and then the total spend and then it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8992-0
01:13:38.928 --> 01:13:41.907
<v Barbel, Sam>Also included the specific payment method
they use,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8992-1
01:13:41.907 --> 01:13:46.776
<v Barbel, Sam>such as a credit card or an online wallet,
and then it also included the location of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8992-2
01:13:46.776 --> 01:13:49.353
<v Barbel, Sam>purchase,
the in store mobile app or online.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8992-3
01:13:49.353 --> 01:13:50.728
<v Barbel, Sam>And then it also includ.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/8994-0
01:13:50.838 --> 01:13:51.718
<v Barbel, Sam>Transaction date.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9016-0
01:13:53.248 --> 01:13:56.033
<v Barbel, Sam>We decided that variables like customer
ID,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9016-1
01:13:56.033 --> 01:14:00.528
<v Barbel, Sam>quantity and transaction date were not
gonna help us predict anything.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9027-0
01:14:00.528 --> 01:14:04.048
<v Barbel, Sam>So we just decided to use category total
spent and location.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9068-0
01:14:05.648 --> 01:14:09.646
<v Barbel, Sam>With the data we had quite a few
challenges and limitations and the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9068-1
01:14:09.646 --> 01:14:13.409
<v Barbel, Sam>biggest one was just an overall lack of
trends within the data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9068-2
01:14:13.409 --> 01:14:16.407
<v Barbel, Sam>There's in this box and whisker plot on
the right,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9068-3
01:14:16.407 --> 01:14:20.288
<v Barbel, Sam>we can kind of see that mobile app is in
blue in store in orange.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9071-0
01:14:20.368 --> 01:14:21.568
<v Barbel, Sam>And online in green.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9088-0
01:14:22.438 --> 01:14:25.828
<v Barbel, Sam>And there's really not a lot of variation
between the data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9088-1
01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.918
<v Barbel, Sam>which made it difficult to glean any.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9114-0
01:14:29.868 --> 01:14:33.527
<v Barbel, Sam>Predictions.
And then we also determine that our data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9114-1
01:14:33.527 --> 01:14:38.948
<v Barbel, Sam>set was potentially not a very accurate
representation of real world purchases.</v>

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:44.768
<v Barbel, Sam>One example of that was a car purchase
where somebody ordered 5 vehicles online</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9145-1
01:14:44.768 --> 01:14:48.658
<v Barbel, Sam>through their phone totaling about a
quarter $1,000,000.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9145-2
01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:53.708
<v Barbel, Sam>And we decided that that was probably an
unlikely real world transaction.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9162-0
01:14:54.568 --> 01:14:58.285
<v Barbel, Sam>And then the other thing was just a
limited number of purchase locations made</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9162-1
01:14:58.285 --> 01:14:59.048
<v Barbel, Sam>differentiation.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9175-0
01:14:59.238 --> 01:15:03.358
<v Barbel, Sam>In between the three difficult in store,
mobile app and online.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9218-0
01:15:03.998 --> 01:15:08.161
<v Barbel, Sam>While they are different,
we assume there could be a little bit of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9218-1
01:15:08.161 --> 01:15:13.131
<v Barbel, Sam>crossover in terms of people shopping
that way and then to kinda help with some</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9218-2
01:15:13.131 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Barbel, Sam>of these challenges and limitations,
we use some ordinal encoding to take some</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9218-3
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.768
<v Barbel, Sam>categorical variables and make them into
numerical to hope.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9243-0
01:15:22.238 --> 01:15:26.932
<v Barbel, Sam>Get a little better differentiation and
then we remove some outliers like the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9243-1
01:15:26.932 --> 01:15:28.918
<v Barbel, Sam>five car online purchase because.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9253-0
01:15:29.198 --> 01:15:33.438
<v Barbel, Sam>We felt that those wouldn't give us any
accurate predictions at all.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9257-0
01:15:39.128 --> 01:15:39.488
<v Benbenek, MATT>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9278-0
01:15:39.488 --> 01:15:43.169
<v Benbenek, MATT>So moving on to the results,
first thing we tried,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9278-1
01:15:43.169 --> 01:15:49.088
<v Benbenek, MATT>like Sam said was a linear regression to
predict price from location of purchase.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9321-0
01:15:49.088 --> 01:15:54.563
<v Benbenek, MATT>So we ordinarily coated location 012 as
you can see it's it's not accurate at all</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9321-1
01:15:54.563 --> 01:15:58.969
<v Benbenek, MATT>because looking at the data,
it seems that there's no correlation</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9321-2
01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:03.576
<v Benbenek, MATT>between spend and location.
We tried again with just the housing and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9321-3
01:16:03.576 --> 01:16:07.248
<v Benbenek, MATT>utility category because put a quick
glance it seemed.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9325-0
01:16:07.248 --> 01:16:08.808
<v Benbenek, MATT>That might be a little less.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9334-0
01:16:09.038 --> 01:16:12.888
<v Benbenek, MATT>Only spread,
but still the analysis didn't really seem</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9334-1
01:16:12.888 --> 01:16:14.078
<v Benbenek, MATT>worthwhile there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9343-0
01:16:15.568 --> 01:16:18.368
<v Benbenek, MATT>So then we moved on to the K means.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9369-0
01:16:19.968 --> 01:16:23.881
<v Benbenek, MATT>Took a step back and tried to find any
different relationships that might have</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9369-1
01:16:23.881 --> 01:16:26.705
<v Benbenek, MATT>been harder to see.
We use K means clustering to have AI</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9369-2
01:16:26.705 --> 01:16:28.488
<v Benbenek, MATT>generate those relationships for us.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9387-0
01:16:28.488 --> 01:16:32.705
<v Benbenek, MATT>So the four variables we included in the
analysis were total spend location,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9387-1
01:16:32.705 --> 01:16:37.252
<v Benbenek, MATT>category of purchase and purchase method
since these ones were the ones we thought</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9387-2
01:16:37.252 --> 01:16:38.128
<v Benbenek, MATT>might be useful.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9412-0
01:16:38.838 --> 01:16:44.084
<v Benbenek, MATT>To our project proposal,
we determined to generate four of these</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9412-1
01:16:44.084 --> 01:16:47.878
<v Benbenek, MATT>by using the elbow method in Silhouette
score.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9422-0
01:16:48.318 --> 01:16:51.918
<v Benbenek, MATT>The clustering, however,
seemed to be mostly driven by cost.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9436-0
01:16:52.558 --> 01:16:55.786
<v Benbenek, MATT>So category 9,
which is the generic shopping category,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9436-1
01:16:55.786 --> 01:16:57.958
<v Benbenek, MATT>had a lot of high-priced items in it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9461-0
01:16:59.488 --> 01:17:02.938
<v Benbenek, MATT>And that weren't outliers.
So we did separate the outliers using the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9461-1
01:17:02.938 --> 01:17:05.938
<v Benbenek, MATT>inner quartile range,
but still a lot of them were in there</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9461-2
01:17:05.938 --> 01:17:08.688
<v Benbenek, MATT>since they're a high quantity of of
high-priced items.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9494-0
01:17:10.598 --> 01:17:15.489
<v Benbenek, MATT>And though that category split off into
three separate clusters,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9494-1
01:17:15.489 --> 01:17:21.359
<v Benbenek, MATT>with only about 50 to 80 data points,
and then the remaining 9800 data points</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9494-2
01:17:21.359 --> 01:17:23.918
<v Benbenek, MATT>were clustered into the first one.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9513-0
01:17:23.998 --> 01:17:26.879
<v Benbenek, MATT>So I think it, you know,
we did learn that there was some</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9513-1
01:17:26.879 --> 01:17:29.164
<v Benbenek, MATT>correlation between category and total
spend.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9513-2
01:17:29.164 --> 01:17:31.598
<v Benbenek, MATT>But as you can see the the mean of the
location.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9526-0
01:17:33.088 --> 01:17:37.197
<v Benbenek, MATT>Is pretty much one across the board,
so there was no correlation that the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9526-1
01:17:37.197 --> 01:17:37.808
<v Benbenek, MATT>clustering.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9531-0
01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:41.558

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9543-0
01:17:43.878 --> 01:17:46.947
<v Benbenek, MATT>Nonetheless,
so we at this point we pretty much knew</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9543-1
01:17:46.947 --> 01:17:47.758
<v Benbenek, MATT>that our data.</v>

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:52.421
<v Benbenek, MATT>Wasn't really gonna yield good results,
but we still went forward and and tried a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9555-1
01:17:52.421 --> 01:17:53.048
<v Benbenek, MATT>regression tree.</v>

01:17:54.648 --> 01:17:58.021
<v Benbenek, MATT>This tree was set up to predict location
of purchase,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9570-1
01:17:58.021 --> 01:18:00.208
<v Benbenek, MATT>given the total spend and category.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9587-0
01:18:00.368 --> 01:18:03.881
<v Benbenek, MATT>And then we had to clip the predictions
to only return 01 and two,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9587-1
01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:05.768
<v Benbenek, MATT>which were our three location types.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9597-0
01:18:07.488 --> 01:18:10.248

01:18:10.648 --> 01:18:13.488
<v Benbenek, MATT>We can see here as expected,
the model did not.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9610-0
01:18:13.758 --> 01:18:15.198
<v Benbenek, MATT>Perform very well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9615-0
01:18:15.268 --> 01:18:18.068

time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9651-0
01:18:19.638 --> 01:18:24.811
<v Benbenek, MATT>We did adjust the Max depth up and down
to see if that changed anything and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9651-1
01:18:24.811 --> 01:18:29.508
<v Benbenek, MATT>actually reducing the depth down to two
improved it by a little bit,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9651-2
01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:31.958
<v Benbenek, MATT>but really not anything significant.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9667-0
01:18:33.558 --> 01:18:37.993
<v Benbenek, MATT>But then we said, you know,

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9667-1
01:18:37.993 --> 01:18:39.558
<v Benbenek, MATT>give increased accuracy.</v>

01:18:39.558 --> 01:18:42.198
<v Benbenek, MATT>We knew it wouldn't since the data didn't
seem to have any trends.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9679-0
01:18:42.198 --> 01:18:45.318
<v Benbenek, MATT>But we did try random forest 100 trees.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9687-0
01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.708
<v Benbenek, MATT>MSC went down.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9703-0
01:18:47.748 --> 01:18:51.884
<v Benbenek, MATT>MSC went down a little bit,
thought maybe it was just predicting 1</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9703-1
01:18:51.884 --> 01:18:56.268
<v Benbenek, MATT>due to averaging over time and and there
was no real trend to pick up.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9711-0
01:18:57.798 --> 01:19:00.156
<v Benbenek, MATT>But yeah,
still not an effective model for this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9711-1
01:19:00.156 --> 01:19:00.598
<v Benbenek, MATT>data set.</v>

01:19:03.108 --> 01:19:07.874
<v Benbenek, MATT>So moving into next steps conclusion,
you know we created a framework with</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9753-1
01:19:07.874 --> 01:19:12.195
<v Benbenek, MATT>multiple models that we thought will work
given a correct data set.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9753-2
01:19:12.195 --> 01:19:15.880
<v Benbenek, MATT>But we said our our data didn't really
reflect real life,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9753-3
01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.201
<v Benbenek, MATT>think it might have been,
you know generated on Kaggle just to have</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9753-4

01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:23.225
<v Benbenek, MATT>Data set and so we didn't get any
meaningful correlation between the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9765-1
01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.068
<v Benbenek, MATT>variables we tested.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9771-0
01:19:25.598 --> 01:19:27.118
<v Benbenek, MATT>To improve, obviously find real data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9787-0
01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:32.238
<v Benbenek, MATT>We we did try and find some other sets on

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9807-0
01:19:33.108 --> 01:19:36.815
<v Benbenek, MATT>Kind of similarly,
just procedurally generated,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9807-1
01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:43.148
<v Benbenek, MATT>maybe with other specific variables in
mind to target, but nothing with location.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9844-0
01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:47.001
<v Benbenek, MATT>And then after we do find that data,
you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9844-1
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:51.809
<v Benbenek, MATT>redevelop the decision tree model and
actually be able to tune it in more,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9844-2
01:19:51.809 --> 01:19:57.130
<v Benbenek, MATT>maybe using boosting bootstrapping if we
can only get a little bit of data to help</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9844-3
01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.348
<v Benbenek, MATT>with that and then.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9854-0
01:19:59.078 --> 01:20:01.350
<v Benbenek, MATT>Further down the line,
once we get a good decision tree model,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9854-1
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.638
<v Benbenek, MATT>we also.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9875-0
01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:04.980
<v Benbenek, MATT>You know,
would like to implement ALM to develop</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9875-1
01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.788
<v Benbenek, MATT>personalized marketing content to users
based on their spending habits.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9893-0
01:20:08.788 --> 01:20:14.764
<v Benbenek, MATT>So pulling in this data and being able to
push it out to their correct location to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9893-1
01:20:14.764 --> 01:20:17.068
<v Benbenek, MATT>generate more business that way.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9912-0
01:20:21.768 --> 01:20:24.647
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yeah. So really kind of what we learned.
Obviously we hit on it,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9912-1
01:20:24.647 --> 01:20:27.968
<v Teske, Benjamin>but your models can only be good as good
as the data set that we're using.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9925-0
01:20:28.208 --> 01:20:32.008
<v Teske, Benjamin>So there is a a few problems that Matt
outlined with the set that we had.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9947-0
01:20:32.008 --> 01:20:36.202
<v Teske, Benjamin>It wasn't accurately representing
probably some real life data and was</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9947-1
01:20:36.202 --> 01:20:39.688
<v Teske, Benjamin>pretty much just kind of an average
across the entire set.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9962-0
01:20:40.488 --> 01:20:43.468
<v Teske, Benjamin>Additional models can be used to double
check initial performance though,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9962-1
01:20:43.468 --> 01:20:46.408
<v Teske, Benjamin>so that was something that we learned as
we continued to try new models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9973-0
01:20:47.158 --> 01:20:51.238
<v Teske, Benjamin>The fact that we were getting kind of the
same answers by all of them.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9983-0
01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:55.348
<v Teske, Benjamin>Gave us a good sign that we were kind of
running the model accurately.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/9991-0
01:20:55.348 --> 01:20:57.668
<v Teske, Benjamin>We just had bad data to run them with and
then.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10028-0
01:20:58.108 --> 01:21:00.335
<v Teske, Benjamin>Like one of the other groups mentioned
earlier,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10028-1
01:21:00.335 --> 01:21:03.491
<v Teske, Benjamin>like cleaning the data is really
important to get that right before</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10028-2
01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:06.507
<v Teske, Benjamin>starting the analysis,
because then you're just gonna have to go</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10028-3
01:21:06.507 --> 01:21:09.894
<v Teske, Benjamin>back and do that eventually. Later.
If you start too early without going</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10028-4
01:21:09.894 --> 01:21:11.518
<v Teske, Benjamin>through and cleaning that. So just.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10050-0
01:21:11.518 --> 01:21:14.626
<v Teske, Benjamin>Other kind of key takeaways that we had
together as a team,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10050-1
01:21:14.626 --> 01:21:18.769
<v Teske, Benjamin>we found that it was difficult to analyze
model performance when using that bad</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10050-2
01:21:18.769 --> 01:21:19.028
<v Teske, Benjamin>data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10058-0
01:21:19.188 --> 01:21:21.468
<v Teske, Benjamin>Our errors were really so high that it
was hard.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10076-0
01:21:21.588 --> 01:21:25.058
<v Teske, Benjamin>It was hard to determine if the model was
actually broken or if there was no real</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10076-1
01:21:25.058 --> 01:21:27.047
<v Teske, Benjamin>correlation,
but the fact that we kept kind of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10076-2
01:21:27.047 --> 01:21:27.428
<v Teske, Benjamin>checking.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10085-0
01:21:27.788 --> 01:21:29.028
<v Teske, Benjamin>Against different models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10103-0
01:21:30.068 --> 01:21:33.844
<v Teske, Benjamin>Kinda showed us that there wasn't a
correlation between the two and that we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10103-1
01:21:33.844 --> 01:21:37.820
<v Teske, Benjamin>were running it accurately and then just
in general it can be hard to find good</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10103-2
01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.068
<v Teske, Benjamin>data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10144-0
01:21:38.068 --> 01:21:41.951
<v Teske, Benjamin>So we kinda hypothesized that's really
why companies are focusing so much on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10144-1
01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:45.835
<v Teske, Benjamin>using AI to kind of generate and protect
their own data and to not make that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10144-2
01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:49.718
<v Teske, Benjamin>publicly available because it is so
important and critical to help run these</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10144-3
01:21:49.718 --> 01:21:52.038
<v Teske, Benjamin>effective models.
When you do have good data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10149-0
01:21:57.578 --> 01:21:58.698
<v Teske, Benjamin>Are there any questions?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10150-0
01:21:57.668 --> 01:21:58.228
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10165-0
01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:06.158
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK, I I honestly,
I I do love your presentation.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10169-0
01:22:06.158 --> 01:22:07.998
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's pretty, pretty cool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10188-0
01:22:08.718 --> 01:22:11.543
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
sometimes you prove it works and and the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10188-1
01:22:11.543 --> 01:22:15.198
<v Hou, Eric>same it has the same value to, you know,
improve it doesn't work.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10194-0
01:22:15.198 --> 01:22:20.198
<v Hou, Eric>So I I totally love love this
presentation. Just one quick question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10208-0
01:22:21.718 --> 01:22:25.428
<v Hou, Eric>Before you,
you you guys started this analysis,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10208-1
01:22:25.428 --> 01:22:27.438
<v Hou, Eric>what was your expectation?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10211-0
01:22:27.438 --> 01:22:31.238
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of initial results?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10216-0
01:22:31.628 --> 01:22:35.148
<v Hou, Eric>What you were hoping to to achieve?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10257-0
01:22:36.688 --> 01:22:41.774
<v Benbenek, MATT>I'd I'd say the main result we were
hoping is you could run like all this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10257-1
01:22:41.774 --> 01:22:47.272
<v Benbenek, MATT>data through to generate a model that
would split a purchase either by category</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10257-2
01:22:47.272 --> 01:22:53.114
<v Benbenek, MATT>or spend or both into different locations.
And then if you're company could use that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10257-3
01:22:53.114 --> 01:22:55.038
<v Benbenek, MATT>data to understand like who?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10270-0
01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:59.006
<v Benbenek, MATT>To target. Like what? What?
What locations are targeting?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10270-1
01:22:59.006 --> 01:23:00.648
<v Benbenek, MATT>What categories or what?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10279-0
01:23:01.478 --> 01:23:04.918
<v Benbenek, MATT>Amount of spend so we can better use that
to market.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10281-0
01:23:05.308 --> 01:23:06.468
<v Benbenek, MATT>To our customers.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10291-0
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:10.208
<v Hou, Eric>I see. So. So yeah, go ahead.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10315-0
01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:13.330
<v Teske, Benjamin>I think I was just going to say kind of
like a hypothesis that we kind of set out</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10315-1
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:18.059
<v Teske, Benjamin>at the beginning was that an online
purchase probably occurs more frequently,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10315-2
01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.878
<v Teske, Benjamin>but at potentially like lower.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10343-0
01:23:21.318 --> 01:23:24.569
<v Teske, Benjamin>Priced items,
but like an in store purchase for the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10343-1
01:23:24.569 --> 01:23:27.944
<v Teske, Benjamin>same type of spend could be a less
frequent purchase,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10343-2
01:23:27.944 --> 01:23:32.758
<v Teske, Benjamin>but consumers are spending more in those
times that they go into the stores.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10354-0
01:23:34.798 --> 01:23:36.951
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then now that was your hypothesis,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10354-1
01:23:36.951 --> 01:23:37.238
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10370-0
01:23:37.238 --> 01:23:40.914
<v Hou, Eric>So then based upon the result that you
guys currently have,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10370-1
01:23:40.914 --> 01:23:44.038
<v Hou, Eric>can you say you prove or disprove your
hypothesis?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10392-0
01:23:45.598 --> 01:23:49.914
<v Teske, Benjamin>Based on the data set that we have,
I think we would say that our hypothesis</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10392-1
01:23:49.914 --> 01:23:54.622
<v Teske, Benjamin>was disproven and that there really isn't
a correlation between location and amount</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10392-2
01:23:54.622 --> 01:23:54.958
<v Teske, Benjamin>spent.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10418-0
01:23:54.998 --> 01:23:59.910
<v Teske, Benjamin>But I think if we analyzed it on other
data that was potentially more applicable</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10418-1
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:03.184
<v Teske, Benjamin>to real life or was more relevant and
representative,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10418-2
01:24:03.184 --> 01:24:06.398
<v Teske, Benjamin>I think it could potentially show
different results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10435-0
01:24:07.558 --> 01:24:11.315
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So, Ben,
I I you guys may have mentioned,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10435-1
01:24:11.315 --> 01:24:13.078
<v Hou, Eric>so I I may have missed.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10459-0
01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:18.164
<v Hou, Eric>So is there any time dimension in your
data that you're focusing on,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10459-1
01:24:18.164 --> 01:24:23.398
<v Hou, Eric>for example like 10 year worth of data or
or three-year worth of data?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10484-0
01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:27.953
<v Hou, Eric>Because if you're focusing on like
three-year worth of data like post COVID,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10484-1
01:24:27.953 --> 01:24:32.627
<v Hou, Eric>I think maybe there is some correlation
that people spending more money online</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10484-2
01:24:32.627 --> 01:24:34.638
<v Hou, Eric>versus in the brick mortar stores.</v>

01:24:34.718 --> 01:24:37.238
<v Hou, Eric>But if you are saying that,
that's just generalized.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10507-0
01:24:37.428 --> 01:24:43.733
<v Hou, Eric>Example 25 year or ten year verse of data
in a post COVID only a proportion of this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10507-1
01:24:43.733 --> 01:24:44.108
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10517-0
01:24:44.108 --> 01:24:48.148
<v Hou, Eric>So then it may maybe you know the effort
may be discounted.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10527-0
01:24:48.268 --> 01:24:52.708
<v Hou, Eric>I just do not know like the time frame of
of the data that you are using to analyze.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10532-0
01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:57.068
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yeah, I don't remember.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10546-0
01:24:57.108 --> 01:24:59.884
<v Teske, Benjamin>Matt and Sam,
do you remember if it gave like dates and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10546-1
01:24:59.884 --> 01:25:03.750
<v Teske, Benjamin>times of? I know it was in the data,
but I don't remember what the time frame</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10546-2
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.948

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10567-0
01:25:07.238 --> 01:25:12.441
<v Benbenek, MATT>I think it was more of like a point of
purchase time in the day and not a like a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10556-0
01:25:08.418 --> 01:25:08.778
<v Barbel, Sam>Sorry.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10564-0
01:25:12.178 --> 01:25:12.658
<v Hou, Eric>You know her?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10567-1

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10593-0
01:25:14.488 --> 01:25:19.717
<v Barbel, Sam>I I think our our data was dating around
like 2023 to 2025 S 2,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10593-1
01:25:19.717 --> 01:25:22.168
<v Barbel, Sam>two to three years back, yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10590-0
01:25:20.268 --> 01:25:20.868
<v Hou, Eric>Oh.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10599-0
01:25:22.468 --> 01:25:24.868
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK, so so meaning that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10623-0
01:25:24.868 --> 01:25:27.552
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
so post COVID and people not you cannot</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10623-1
01:25:27.552 --> 01:25:31.428
<v Hou, Eric>differentiate like people shopping from
different locations, OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10624-0
01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:32.508
<v Hou, Eric>So good insight.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10627-0
01:25:31.908 --> 01:25:32.628
<v Barbel, Sam>Correct. Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10638-0
01:25:32.508 --> 01:25:36.468
<v Hou, Eric>It's good inside. OK,
so based upon the result,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10638-1
01:25:36.468 --> 01:25:39.108
<v Hou, Eric>which stock should I short sell?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10649-0
01:25:43.798 --> 01:25:45.918
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Perfect. Abigail.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10650-0
01:25:44.168 --> 01:25:46.288
<v Benbenek, MATT>I don't know if I'm touching anything
right now.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10658-0
01:25:48.918 --> 01:25:50.238
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10662-0
01:25:50.238 --> 01:25:52.718
<v Hou, Eric>Fantastic.
Thank you so much for the presentation.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10667-0
01:25:53.268 --> 01:25:53.908
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I think.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10668-0
01:25:53.908 --> 01:25:55.148
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just take a break.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10676-0
01:25:56.638 --> 01:25:59.638
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just come back, regroup at 7:10.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10685-0
01:25:59.798 --> 01:26:03.318
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just, you know,
one one minute last for the break.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10703-0
01:26:03.318 --> 01:26:07.384
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can just keep continue our
presentations. OK,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10703-1
01:26:07.384 --> 01:26:11.878
<v Hou, Eric>after break the first group will present
will be group 10, OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10720-0
01:26:11.878 --> 01:26:16.170
<v Hou, Eric>So then at 7:10.
So then maybe you guys wanna have your</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10720-1
01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:20.078
<v Hou, Eric>start share your screen,
have your deck ready. OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10725-0
01:26:20.078 --> 01:26:22.158
<v Hou, Eric>So I will see you back at 7:10.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10846-0
01:39:55.428 --> 01:39:55.908
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10847-0
01:39:55.908 --> 01:39:56.708
<v Hou, Eric>Welcome back.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10853-0
01:39:58.198 --> 01:39:59.598
<v Hou, Eric>I think Group 10.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10855-0
01:40:00.988 --> 01:40:01.748
<v Hou, Eric>Your turn.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10858-0
01:40:05.848 --> 01:40:06.488
<v Weidner, Declan>Alrighty.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10859-0
01:40:07.678 --> 01:40:08.318
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10865-0
01:40:15.078 --> 01:40:16.478
<v Hou, Eric>Kaitlyn, I think you are on mute.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10871-0
01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.638
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>There we go. OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10884-0
01:40:19.638 --> 01:40:23.658
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>So for our final project,
we decided to focus on dynamic portfolio</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10884-1
01:40:23.658 --> 01:40:24.438
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>optimization.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10926-0
01:40:25.838 --> 01:40:30.226
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>Portfolio optimization has been a
constant problem in finance for both</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10926-1
01:40:30.226 --> 01:40:35.046
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>large scale companies and small traders
and is the process in which investors</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10926-2
01:40:35.046 --> 01:40:39.558
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>allocate their assets to maximize return
while minimizing risk taken on.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10929-0
01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:41.708
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>The problem?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10975-0
01:40:41.708 --> 01:40:45.578
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>We decided to focus on was that
traditional portfolio optimization</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10975-1
01:40:45.578 --> 01:40:50.431
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>techniques such as CAPM and mean variance
optimization operate under the assumption</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10975-2
01:40:50.431 --> 01:40:54.648
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>of static market conditions and require
investors to specify risk return</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10975-3
01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:58.345
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>preferences in advance.
These methods often struggle to perform</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10975-4
01:40:58.345 --> 01:41:01.118
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>when faced with the complexities of real
world.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10977-0
01:41:01.118 --> 01:41:01.348
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>Markets.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10996-0
01:41:03.428 --> 01:41:06.879
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>In reality,
financial markets are highly dynamic.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10996-1
01:41:06.879 --> 01:41:10.331
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>Asset prices,
volatilities and correlation change</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/10996-2
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:11.228
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>continuously.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11013-0
01:41:11.628 --> 01:41:15.387
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>So static models are not suited to
respond to these fluctuations,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11013-1
01:41:15.387 --> 01:41:18.348
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>leading to sub optimal asset allocations
over time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11048-0
01:41:19.798 --> 01:41:22.833
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>So to bridge this gap,
our project proposes a development of a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11048-1
01:41:22.833 --> 01:41:26.734
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>reinforcement learning agent capable of
learning portfolio allocation strategies</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11048-2
01:41:26.734 --> 01:41:28.998
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>directly through interaction with market
data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11085-0
01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:35.147
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>Instead of relying on fixed assumptions,
the real agent will continuously adapt</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11085-1
01:41:35.147 --> 01:41:38.959
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>its portfolio decisions based on evolving
market conditions,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11085-2
01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:42.708
<v Huebner, Kaitlyn>aiming to maximize returns while managing
risk dynamically.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11107-0
01:41:45.258 --> 01:41:49.751
<v Weidner, Declan>So I'll start with talking why dynamic
portfolio optimization matters in the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11107-1
01:41:49.751 --> 01:41:53.018
<v Weidner, Declan>real world. First off,
markets today aren't stationary.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11141-0
01:41:53.298 --> 01:41:56.896
<v Weidner, Declan>They can swing between bull runs,
crashes and sideways trends,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11141-1
01:41:56.896 --> 01:42:01.465
<v Weidner, Declan>and along with that the traditional mean
variance frameworks in CAPM assume you</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11141-2
01:42:01.465 --> 01:42:04.778
<v Weidner, Declan>pick a risk return,
trade off one time and stick with it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11153-0
01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:08.693
<v Weidner, Declan>But when volatility shifts,
maybe during a crash or something,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11153-1
01:42:08.693 --> 01:42:10.538
<v Weidner, Declan>those allocations will lag or.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11157-0
01:42:11.198 --> 01:42:11.838
<v Weidner, Declan>Can suffer large drawdowns.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11172-0
01:42:13.158 --> 01:42:15.380
<v Weidner, Declan>Second,
this underperformance has real</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11172-1
01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.918
<v Weidner, Declan>consequences for investors.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11183-0
01:42:16.958 --> 01:42:21.165
<v Weidner, Declan>Institutional managers face a lot of
pressure if their portfolios fall behind</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11183-1
01:42:21.165 --> 01:42:21.758
<v Weidner, Declan>benchmarks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11219-0
01:42:23.278 --> 01:42:28.562
<v Weidner, Declan>Retail investors that are chasing higher
yields or a smoother ride want strategies</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11219-1
01:42:28.562 --> 01:42:32.636
<v Weidner, Declan>that adapt in real time to change along
with market conditions.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11219-2
01:42:32.636 --> 01:42:37.856
<v Weidner, Declan>And so our our approach aims to deliver
superior risk adjusted returns across the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11219-3
01:42:37.856 --> 01:42:38.238
<v Weidner, Declan>board.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11230-0
01:42:39.918 --> 01:42:42.055
<v Weidner, Declan>And finally,
the adaptability that the that</v>

<v Weidner, Declan>and then also protect yourself from any

01:43:18.438 --> 01:43:20.158
<v Weidner, Declan>We use two reinforcement learning agents.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11319-0
01:43:20.158 --> 01:43:21.158

01:43:21.318 --> 01:43:26.166
<v Weidner, Declan>The other is PPO.
The Dqn treats portfolio allocation as a</v>

01:43:27.398 --> 01:43:30.358
<v Weidner, Declan>And it chooses from a set of predefined

01:43:30.638 --> 01:43:35.878
<v Weidner, Declan>It learns aq value for each choice by

01:43:38.438 --> 01:43:38.798
<v Weidner, Declan>The PPO.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11371-0
01:43:38.798 --> 01:43:42.918

<v Weidner, Declan>And this is really useful in like noisy
financial environments.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11420-0
01:43:55.358 --> 01:43:59.589
<v Weidner, Declan>And I forgot to say,

01:43:59.589 --> 01:44:02.318

01:44:04.478 --> 01:44:07.983
<v Weidner, Declan>And then to know if our agents are
actually adding value,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11439-1
01:44:07.983 --> 01:44:10.158
<v Weidner, Declan>we compare them against 3 baselines.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11447-0
01:44:10.158 --> 01:44:14.038
<v Weidner, Declan>The first is the buy and hold which just
invests and never rebalances.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11488-0
01:44:15.018 --> 01:44:17.947
<v Weidner, Declan>Which is an easy benchmark to be in
volatile times.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11488-1
01:44:17.947 --> 01:44:22.623
<v Weidner, Declan>And then we have equal weighted portfolio
which rebalances daily to maintain equal</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11488-2
01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:26.059
<v Weidner, Declan>exposure across assets.
And then the risk parity model which</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11488-3
01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:28.538
<v Weidner, Declan>allocates based on each asset's
volatility.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11497-0
01:44:29.958 --> 01:44:31.918
<v Weidner, Declan>That's another interesting but rule based
approach.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11529-0
01:44:32.238 --> 01:44:35.841
<v Weidner, Declan>And then we labor,
we layer in the hybrid approach using the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11529-1
01:44:35.841 --> 01:44:40.094
<v Weidner, Declan>traditional machine learning to
preprocess our inputs and that helps us</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11529-2
01:44:40.094 --> 01:44:43.638
<v Weidner, Declan>reduce noise and stabilize the learning
curves and it also.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11538-0
01:44:44.428 --> 01:44:49.828

01:44:55.148 --> 01:44:59.200
<v Carone, Matt>All right. So for our project,
we used financial data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11581-1
01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:04.652
<v Carone, Matt>financial data coming from Cagle,
specifically focusing on Yahoo finance,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11581-2
01:45:04.652 --> 01:45:10.693
<v Carone, Matt>imported data and historical prices over
the last five years of the daily data on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11581-3
01:45:10.693 --> 01:45:12.388
<v Carone, Matt>the S&amp;P 500 stocks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11603-0
01:45:13.958 --> 01:45:17.835
<v Carone, Matt>And including in this information were
the stock prices, trading volume,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11603-1
01:45:17.835 --> 01:45:21.499
<v Carone, Matt>interest rates and other market
indicators that could help our model</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11603-2
01:45:21.499 --> 01:45:23.198
<v Carone, Matt>understand how the market moves.</v>

01:45:24.588 --> 01:45:27.388
<v Carone, Matt>So first we had to pre process.</v>

01:45:30.538 --> 01:45:35.170
<v Carone, Matt>Handling any missing missing information,

01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:37.458
<v Carone, Matt>narrowing it down to the most important.</v>

01:45:57.158 --> 01:45:58.238

01:46:05.508 --> 01:46:07.908
<v Carone, Matt>Well, I guess I'll backtrack a little bit,
but.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11683-0
01:46:09.478 --> 01:46:13.295
<v Carone, Matt>Just as I was talking about how we had to
preprocess our data and it was a very</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11683-1
01:46:13.295 --> 01:46:15.823
<v Carone, Matt>important step just because if the data
isn't clean,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11683-2
01:46:15.823 --> 01:46:17.398
<v Carone, Matt>the model doesn't learn properly.</v>

01:46:17.398 --> 01:46:21.844
<v Carone, Matt>But with this came issues as it's such a
big data set.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11707-1
01:46:21.844 --> 01:46:27.908
<v Carone, Matt>Trying to clean it gave us a lot of
errors and just kind of struggles down</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11707-2

01:46:30.438 --> 01:46:34.838
<v Carone, Matt>And then kind of moving on to other
issues that we really ran into was.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11727-0
01:46:35.268 --> 01:46:38.108
<v Carone, Matt>During the reinforcement learning

01:46:40.078 --> 01:46:44.044
<v Carone, Matt>Just the amount of time and effort that
that took to run all this data through a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11747-1
01:46:44.044 --> 01:46:45.758

01:46:47.518 --> 01:46:52.238
<v Carone, Matt>You can imagine how how long you know
kind of have an AI model function with.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11777-0
01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:57.436
<v Carone, Matt>Buy and selling and holding and
relearning and putting information,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11777-1
01:46:57.436 --> 01:46:59.278
<v Carone, Matt>storing it and everything like that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11790-0
01:46:59.278 --> 01:47:02.926
<v Carone, Matt>So when you do run into issues,
it does take quite a while to try to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11790-1
01:47:02.926 --> 01:47:03.878
<v Carone, Matt>troubleshoot that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11833-0
01:47:04.748 --> 01:47:09.790
<v Carone, Matt>And then another big issue that we faced
was we didn't have access to full live</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11833-1
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:14.518
<v Carone, Matt>data in real time stock market data,
which is definitely something that we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11833-2
01:47:14.518 --> 01:47:19.434
<v Carone, Matt>want to look forward to using in the
future with this model just because only</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11833-3
01:47:19.434 --> 01:47:21.388
<v Carone, Matt>focusing on historic CS can be.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11852-0
01:47:21.388 --> 01:47:24.681
<v Carone, Matt>Efficient,
but if the model can run with real time</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11852-1
01:47:24.681 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Carone, Matt>data,
then it's really going to function at the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11852-2
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.588
<v Carone, Matt>most efficient way possible.</v>

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:37.268
<v Carone, Matt>So here is kind of a little bit of our

01:47:38.758 --> 01:47:42.789
<v Carone, Matt>So just going through it,
we loaded our data in and then tried to,</v>

01:47:54.936 --> 01:47:57.460
<v Carone, Matt>model.
And then we also did a little bit of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11920-2
01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:00.270
<v Carone, Matt>scaling.
So we use the min Max scaler as well to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11920-3
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:02.278
<v Carone, Matt>make it easier for the AI to learn.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11924-0
01:48:03.038 --> 01:48:05.518
<v Carone, Matt>Just you know,
if all the numbers are on the same level.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11930-0
01:48:06.788 --> 01:48:08.708
<v Carone, Matt>And then you can go to the next slide.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11940-0
01:48:09.988 --> 01:48:14.388
<v Carone, Matt>And this one is how we started building
our custom environment for the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11974-0
01:48:15.918 --> 01:48:20.392
<v Carone, Matt>Reinforcement learning and we named it
our portfolio environment and so</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11974-1
01:48:20.392 --> 01:48:23.872
<v Carone, Matt>basically in this world,
it's where the AI starts with.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11974-2
01:48:23.872 --> 01:48:27.662
<v Carone, Matt>We gave it a fake $100,
000 and it can choose to either buy,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/11974-3
01:48:27.662 --> 01:48:29.278
<v Carone, Matt>sell or hold these stocks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12009-0
01:48:30.268 --> 01:48:34.846
<v Carone, Matt>Each step it takes,
it looks at the stock market data we gave</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12009-1
01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:41.049
<v Carone, Matt>it and it kind of makes a choice based on
that and will receive either points based</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12009-2
01:48:41.049 --> 01:48:46.514
<v Carone, Matt>on how well it does or how bad it does
based on either buying or selling.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12009-3
01:48:46.514 --> 01:48:47.548
<v Carone, Matt>And then as a.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12020-0
01:48:47.548 --> 01:48:51.308
<v Carone, Matt>Hold it kind of has a flat rate of,
you know, a good job, a good point.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12043-0
01:48:53.828 --> 01:48:57.640
<v Carone, Matt>Then we also added a reset function so we
could restart the environment at any time</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12043-1
01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.271
<v Carone, Matt>and try to train the AI as many times
from the beginning,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12043-2
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:02.268
<v Carone, Matt>just so it wasn't running one time
through.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12079-0
01:49:03.798 --> 01:49:07.747
<v Carone, Matt>And then yeah,
so I don't think we have a picture of it,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12079-1
01:49:07.747 --> 01:49:13.081
<v Carone, Matt>but basically the AII in this model can
choose between a sell holder by zero</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12079-2
01:49:13.081 --> 01:49:16.198
<v Carone, Matt>being sell,
hold being one and two being by.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12082-0
01:49:16.318 --> 01:49:17.798
<v Carone, Matt>So if it chooses to sell.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12085-0
01:49:19.718 --> 01:49:20.078
<v Carone, Matt>And it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12091-0
01:49:20.078 --> 01:49:20.838
<v Carone, Matt>And it wins its money.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12096-0
01:49:20.838 --> 01:49:22.878
<v Carone, Matt>Then it gets a small reward.
As I said earlier.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12115-0
01:49:23.668 --> 01:49:27.388
<v Carone, Matt>And then if it chooses to buy and it wins
its money, then it gets a small role.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12122-0
01:49:27.388 --> 01:49:30.930
<v Carone, Matt>There's a well,
but it can't get punished as a buys</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12122-1
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:31.748
<v Carone, Matt>incorrectly.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12124-0
01:49:35.298 --> 01:49:36.258
<v Carone, Matt>And then.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12139-0
01:49:37.718 --> 01:49:42.158
<v Carone, Matt>Here is where we created evaluation tools
to measure how well the AI is doing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12164-0
01:49:42.158 --> 01:49:48.348
<v Carone, Matt>So we created the calculate RMSE function
which basically just looks at how close</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12164-1
01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:52.198
<v Carone, Matt>the Ai's prediction are compared to the
real data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12188-0
01:49:52.198 --> 01:49:57.271
<v Carone, Matt>And basically we were looking to see if
we function with a lower RMSE,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12188-1
01:49:57.271 --> 01:50:02.486
<v Carone, Matt>which means that we had better
predictions just based on how to optimize</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12188-2
01:50:02.486 --> 01:50:03.558
<v Carone, Matt>this portfolio.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12235-0
01:50:04.228 --> 01:50:07.949
<v Carone, Matt>Dynamically and then we did the calculate
Sharpe ratio,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12235-1
01:50:07.949 --> 01:50:12.335
<v Carone, Matt>which basically looked at the returns and
the risk free rate of .</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12213-0
01:50:11.758 --> 01:50:12.438
<v Hou, Eric>Good morning.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12235-2
01:50:12.335 --> 01:50:17.850
<v Carone, Matt>01 and basically taking this into account,
we wanted to find a higher Sharpe ratio</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12235-3
01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:21.638
<v Carone, Matt>based on our mild on our model,
which just kind of conc.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12258-0
01:50:21.708 --> 01:50:26.416
<v Carone, Matt>That it's smarter investing and then we
also decided to calculate volatility and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12258-1
01:50:26.416 --> 01:50:29.788
<v Carone, Matt>this just measures how the portfolio
bounces up and down.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12267-0
01:50:30.598 --> 01:50:33.038
<v Carone, Matt>Obviously for this model,
we're looking for lower volatility.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12277-0
01:50:33.508 --> 01:50:36.788
<v Carone, Matt>Just meaning that it's smoother and safer
performance.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12280-0
01:50:40.268 --> 01:50:40.868
<v Bodine, Will>All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12333-0
01:50:40.868 --> 01:50:45.614
<v Bodine, Will>And then I'll go into the next steps and
future improvements that we have.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12333-1
01:50:45.614 --> 01:50:50.612
<v Bodine, Will>As we mentioned a little bit before,
we want to put a lot of emphasis on focus</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12333-2
01:50:50.612 --> 01:50:54.662
<v Bodine, Will>on reinforcement learning.
We would also want to finalize data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12333-3
01:50:54.662 --> 01:50:58.016
<v Bodine, Will>analyze results,
strengthen baseline comparisons and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12333-4
01:50:58.016 --> 01:50:59.028
<v Bodine, Will>overall just EN.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12361-0
01:50:59.308 --> 01:51:02.794
<v Bodine, Will>The model that we created,
whether that's adding more years to it or</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12361-1
01:51:02.794 --> 01:51:06.582
<v Bodine, Will>making sure there's no holes in it,
basically all these next steps we have</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12361-2
01:51:06.582 --> 01:51:10.068
<v Bodine, Will>are things that would just come with more
time working on the model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12371-0
01:51:10.558 --> 01:51:13.638
<v Bodine, Will>And and working together to make it the
best it could become.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12379-0
01:51:15.438 --> 01:51:17.718
<v Bodine, Will>And then lastly, for our team reflection.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12394-0
01:51:19.918 --> 01:51:23.398
<v Bodine, Will>What we learned was the first thing we
learned was the complexity of the market.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12404-0
01:51:23.398 --> 01:51:27.270
<v Bodine, Will>Obviously it's it's an ever changing
market and it's it can be very hard to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12404-1
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.678
<v Bodine, Will>predict.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12409-0
01:51:27.678 --> 01:51:30.318
<v Bodine, Will>So that's kind of what this whole project
was about.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12430-0
01:51:31.958 --> 01:51:35.953
<v Bodine, Will>And the importance of data reprocessing,
which we talked about and then our</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12430-1
01:51:35.953 --> 01:51:38.318
<v Bodine, Will>biggest takeaways were communication is
key.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12448-0
01:51:38.838 --> 01:51:42.818
<v Bodine, Will>We found that we worked really well
together when we communicated efficiently</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12448-1
01:51:42.818 --> 01:51:45.318
<v Bodine, Will>and when we didn't.
It proved to be a difficult.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12477-0
01:51:45.748 --> 01:51:49.847
<v Bodine, Will>Project and then that success metrics
matter in this project.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12477-1
01:51:49.847 --> 01:51:53.483
<v Bodine, Will>Like we just talked about the Sharpe
ratio volatility,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12477-2
01:51:53.483 --> 01:51:56.788
<v Bodine, Will>all those things really became a big
factor here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12482-0
01:51:58.278 --> 01:51:59.798
<v Bodine, Will>And that is any questions?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12514-0
01:52:04.028 --> 01:52:07.232
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I I appreciate that you.
You brought up applying that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12514-1
01:52:07.232 --> 01:52:11.451
<v Hou, Eric>communication is key. So totally right.
So then as a for As for a team, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12514-2
01:52:11.451 --> 01:52:14.068
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to communicate with each
other.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12515-0
01:52:14.108 --> 01:52:15.268
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12518-0
01:52:15.508 --> 01:52:16.908
<v Hou, Eric>What's the results?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12522-0
01:52:17.668 --> 01:52:18.188
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12538-0
01:52:18.188 --> 01:52:23.715
<v Hou, Eric>What's the result in terms of ROI that
you're your reinforcement model versus</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12538-1
01:52:23.715 --> 01:52:25.628
<v Hou, Eric>the other three benchmarks?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12573-0
01:52:29.088 --> 01:52:32.752
<v Carone, Matt>So actually we haven't been able to fully
get results yet for this,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12573-1
01:52:32.752 --> 01:52:36.578
<v Carone, Matt>just as we've been running it,
we kinda have more of a prototype as of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12555-0
01:52:34.198 --> 01:52:34.718
<v Hou, Eric>I see.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12573-2
01:52:36.578 --> 01:52:39.488
<v Carone, Matt>now just with the reinforcement learning
environment.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12569-0
01:52:37.898 --> 01:52:38.258
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12586-0
01:52:39.488 --> 01:52:43.196
<v Carone, Matt>It's just been taking a lot of time and
we're all busy with a lot of other stuff</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12586-1
01:52:43.196 --> 01:52:43.608
<v Carone, Matt>going on.</v>

<v Carone, Matt>That's why we kind of said,
talked about communication just down the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12595-1
01:52:46.738 --> 01:52:47.328
<v Carone, Matt>stretch here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12609-0
01:52:47.328 --> 01:52:51.105
<v Carone, Matt>We thought we would finish it up in time,
but didn't actually get to,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12609-1
01:52:51.105 --> 01:52:53.048
<v Carone, Matt>but we know that with these outputs.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12606-0
01:52:51.568 --> 01:52:52.008
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12624-0
01:52:54.038 --> 01:52:57.870
<v Carone, Matt>And everything in the future that we'll
have it done and it should give us a good</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12624-1
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:58.758
<v Carone, Matt>idea just based on.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12633-0
01:52:59.788 --> 01:53:02.908
<v Carone, Matt>How much we put into this that we'll have
some good results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12636-0
01:53:04.008 --> 01:53:04.648
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, do.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12658-0
01:53:04.648 --> 01:53:10.960
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think that by May the 5th you guys
can have some result that in the final</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12658-1
01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.688
<v Hou, Eric>project paper like just one? Oh OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12666-0
01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.118
<v Carone, Matt>Yes. Yeah, will.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12661-0
01:53:13.438 --> 01:53:13.998
<v Weidner, Declan>Yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12673-0
01:53:14.238 --> 01:53:16.344
<v Carone, Matt>Yeah,
we're definitely planning on having that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12673-1
01:53:16.344 --> 01:53:17.598
<v Carone, Matt>all done by then wrapped up.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12677-0
01:53:17.318 --> 01:53:18.238
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12683-0
01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:20.638
<v Hou, Eric>That's it's a very interesting idea.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12690-0
01:53:20.638 --> 01:53:22.838
<v Hou, Eric>And then I I believe a lot of people are
doing this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12698-0
01:53:22.838 --> 01:53:27.918
<v Hou, Eric>So then I believe your your project has
much good good future.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12706-0
01:53:29.478 --> 01:53:31.398
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
since you don't have any results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12725-0
01:53:31.398 --> 01:53:36.783
<v Hou, Eric>So that's fine because 11 next question
I'm I'm about to ask is if you just use a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12725-1
01:53:36.783 --> 01:53:39.278
<v Hou, Eric>random random number generator, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12744-0
01:53:39.278 --> 01:53:43.646
<v Hou, Eric>So then just you have a 01/2,
I just use that random number to generate</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12744-1
01:53:43.646 --> 01:53:46.558
<v Hou, Eric>like my decision whether I'm going to buy
more.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12750-0
01:53:46.908 --> 01:53:48.668
<v Hou, Eric>Or I just sell all?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12772-0
01:53:48.668 --> 01:53:54.098
<v Hou, Eric>So then I wonder if that reinforcement
kind of learning algorithm will be that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12772-1
01:53:54.098 --> 01:53:57.948
<v Hou, Eric>kind of decision making kind of algorithm,
because I I.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12776-0
01:53:57.568 --> 01:54:02.038
<v Carone, Matt>I guess we, yeah,
we we would hope that it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12785-0
01:54:01.018 --> 01:54:01.818
<v Hou, Eric>Right, right. So.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12782-0
01:54:02.038 --> 01:54:02.368
<v Carone, Matt>But I think we're getting there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12790-0
01:54:02.368 --> 01:54:04.688
<v Carone, Matt>We're getting there with it, so yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12798-0
01:54:04.478 --> 01:54:06.838
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK. I I'm just curious, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12805-0
01:54:06.838 --> 01:54:11.838
<v Hou, Eric>Because I I read one paper or something
that they are.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12836-0
01:54:11.838 --> 01:54:14.167
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
there are some random guessing method and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12836-1
01:54:14.167 --> 01:54:17.856
<v Hou, Eric>then they they they be the market,
which is kind of interesting because you</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12836-2
01:54:17.856 --> 01:54:21.593
<v Hou, Eric>already have the framework set up and
then you have like run them run number</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12836-3
01:54:21.593 --> 01:54:22.078
<v Hou, Eric>generator.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12843-0
01:54:22.078 --> 01:54:25.358
<v Hou, Eric>So to make the decision randomly I just
wanna.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12856-0
01:54:25.518 --> 01:54:30.998
<v Hou, Eric>I just really curious if if these are
real kind of algorithm could be that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12875-0
01:54:31.428 --> 01:54:35.383
<v Hou, Eric>Decision making head of method.
I'm pretty sure he will just want to know</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12875-1
01:54:35.383 --> 01:54:37.468
<v Hou, Eric>like how big the difference it will be.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12881-0
01:54:37.668 --> 01:54:39.308
<v Carone, Matt>Yeah,
that definitely would be something</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12881-1
01:54:39.308 --> 01:54:40.228
<v Carone, Matt>interesting to look at.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12889-0
01:54:40.518 --> 01:54:42.758
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, but pretty, pretty cool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12890-0
01:54:42.758 --> 01:54:43.238
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty cool.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12899-0

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12914-0
01:54:49.678 --> 01:54:53.278
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Next one, group six. Oh well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12916-0
01:54:55.898 --> 01:54:56.858
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12931-0
01:54:59.948 --> 01:55:02.788
<v Mertens, Aidric>Hey everyone I'm Adrix joined by Willy
today.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12961-0
01:55:02.788 --> 01:55:08.504
<v Mertens, Aidric>We'll walk you through a neural network
approach to predicting industrial loan</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12961-1
01:55:08.504 --> 01:55:12.195
<v Mertens, Aidric>defaults,
primarily used small business admin loan</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12961-2
01:55:12.195 --> 01:55:15.668
<v Mertens, Aidric>data,
economic indicators and credit variables.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12966-0
01:55:21.388 --> 01:55:24.268
<v Galligan, Willy>Awesome. So I'll kick it off here so.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/12970-0
01:55:28.778 --> 01:55:30.098
<v Galligan, Willy>Sorry, one second here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13015-0
01:55:32.238 --> 01:55:35.985
<v Galligan, Willy>All right. So to start,
just to give you a little bit of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13015-1
01:55:35.985 --> 01:55:41.178
<v Galligan, Willy>background on industrial loan losses,
since kind of a commercial banking term,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13015-2
01:55:41.178 --> 01:55:46.569
<v Galligan, Willy>balance sheet forecasting term that not
everyone might have at least had previous</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13015-3
01:55:46.569 --> 01:55:47.358
<v Galligan, Willy>exposure to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13037-0
01:55:47.678 --> 01:55:53.702
<v Galligan, Willy>So industrial loan losses are financial
losses incurred by banks and financial</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13037-1
01:55:53.702 --> 01:55:57.438
<v Galligan, Willy>institutions when borrowers default on
loans or.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13039-0
01:55:58.358 --> 01:55:58.918
<v Galligan, Willy>For example.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13059-0
01:56:00.628 --> 01:56:06.068
<v Galligan, Willy>Fail to repay the principle and interest
is agreed upon in the terms of their note.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13065-0
01:56:07.028 --> 01:56:11.108
<v Galligan, Willy>These are typically tied to commercial or
industrial loans.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13084-0
01:56:12.638 --> 01:56:15.718
<v Galligan, Willy>Hence,
industrial loan loss that are extended to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13084-1
01:56:15.718 --> 01:56:19.238
<v Galligan, Willy>companies for purposes such as like
capital investment.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13100-0
01:56:20.878 --> 01:56:25.918
<v Galligan, Willy>Equity or equipment purchases or various
operational expenses?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13103-0
01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:28.478
<v Galligan, Willy>So some of the key points here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13122-0
01:56:29.618 --> 01:56:36.548
<v Galligan, Willy>Some causes behind these losses are,
for example, borrower insolvency,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13122-1
01:56:36.548 --> 01:56:41.818
<v Galligan, Willy>macroeconomic downturn,
industry specific challenges.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13154-0
01:56:43.198 --> 01:56:49.065
<v Galligan, Willy>Especially like with the tariffs that
we're seeing now or just poor credit risk</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13154-1
01:56:49.065 --> 01:56:52.658
<v Galligan, Willy>management,
this is very impactful for financial</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13154-2
01:56:52.658 --> 01:56:56.105
<v Galligan, Willy>institutions,
especially since banks set aside</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13154-3
01:56:56.105 --> 01:56:58.158
<v Galligan, Willy>provisions for these losses.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13170-0
01:56:59.188 --> 01:57:03.448
<v Galligan, Willy>Which reduces their capital reserves and
available liquidity.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13170-1
01:57:03.448 --> 01:57:05.028
<v Galligan, Willy>So they're not able to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13181-0
01:57:06.638 --> 01:57:10.438
<v Galligan, Willy>Loan out that liquidity and collect
interest on it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13185-0
01:57:10.798 --> 01:57:12.198
<v Galligan, Willy>So very impactful.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13195-0
01:57:12.678 --> 01:57:17.438
<v Galligan, Willy>And then these are typically reported as
a percentage of total loans.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13201-0
01:57:19.078 --> 01:57:20.758
<v Galligan, Willy>Or as a net charge off ratio.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13222-0
01:57:22.028 --> 01:57:28.194
<v Galligan, Willy>And then these provisions are forecasted
by banks and financial institutions since</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13222-1
01:57:28.194 --> 01:57:33.468
<v Galligan, Willy>they need the loan loss provision to
essentially total their expected.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13226-0
01:57:34.998 --> 01:57:36.118
<v Galligan, Willy>Unpaid notes.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13235-0
01:57:36.638 --> 01:57:40.358
<v Galligan, Willy>So you can see how critical it is that
they get this forecasting right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13248-0
01:57:42.028 --> 01:57:47.348
<v Galligan, Willy>And recently these aband between .
8% and 1% of total loans.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13294-0
01:57:52.468 --> 01:57:56.349
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yep.
So just stay on the same subject here to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13294-1
01:57:56.349 --> 01:58:02.676
<v Mertens, Aidric>show the financial ramifications of of
loan losses we see during the great</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13294-2
01:58:02.676 --> 01:58:07.737
<v Mertens, Aidric>financial crisis.
It peaks at 230 billion for for allowance</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13294-3
01:58:07.737 --> 01:58:12.546
<v Mertens, Aidric>for loan loss,
steadily goes down up until 2019 and then</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13294-4
01:58:12.546 --> 01:58:13.558
<v Mertens, Aidric>spikes back.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13303-0
01:58:13.588 --> 01:58:16.508
<v Mertens, Aidric>Up to 210 billion during COVID.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13318-0
01:58:17.318 --> 01:58:21.078
<v Mertens, Aidric>It kind of underscores how provisioning
only jumps in reaction to crisis.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13332-0
01:58:22.188 --> 01:58:27.748
<v Mertens, Aidric>That's why we're building a predictive
model that flags trouble earlier.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-0
01:58:32.248 --> 01:58:35.324
<v Galligan, Willy>Awesome.
So we saw this as a opportunity to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-1
01:58:35.324 --> 01:58:38.470
<v Galligan, Willy>implement neural networks into this
problem,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-2
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:43.363
<v Galligan, Willy>mainly due to the complexity of
forecasting loan loss provisions that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-3
01:58:43.363 --> 01:58:47.977
<v Galligan, Willy>goes on behind the scenes.
Neural networks are excellent for this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-4
01:58:47.977 --> 01:58:53.359
<v Galligan, Willy>because they're great at identifying
nonlinear complex relationships such as</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13380-5
01:58:53.359 --> 01:58:54.478
<v Galligan, Willy>loan loss. Prov.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13382-0
01:58:54.548 --> 01:58:55.428
<v Galligan, Willy>Forecasting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13404-0
01:58:57.758 --> 01:59:01.747
<v Galligan, Willy>So the ability to process
multidimensional data that is both</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13404-1
01:59:01.747 --> 01:59:05.998
<v Galligan, Willy>quantitative and qualitative,
especially seen in credit metrics.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13408-0
01:59:09.588 --> 01:59:11.228
<v Galligan, Willy>Uh, sorry I here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13411-0
01:59:16.618 --> 01:59:19.858
<v Galligan, Willy>So sorry.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13421-0
01:59:21.358 --> 01:59:23.598
<v Galligan, Willy>Sorry,
my computer's just messing up here a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13421-1
01:59:23.598 --> 01:59:24.158
<v Galligan, Willy>little bit.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13428-0
01:59:28.148 --> 01:59:30.428
<v Galligan, Willy>Oh,
so some of the key advantages of using.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13438-0
01:59:31.958 --> 01:59:34.558
<v Galligan, Willy>A neural network are the proactive risk
management.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13451-0
01:59:34.638 --> 01:59:39.165
<v Galligan, Willy>So like I said,
a more complex forecasting methodology</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13451-1
01:59:39.165 --> 01:59:40.318
<v Galligan, Willy>and then four.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13472-0
01:59:40.318 --> 01:59:45.405
<v Galligan, Willy>So theoretically this tool would be given
to institutions on their forecasting team</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13472-1
01:59:45.405 --> 01:59:49.887
<v Galligan, Willy>and it can be a lot more adaptable,
especially when you retrain the model</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13472-2
01:59:49.887 --> 01:59:51.038
<v Galligan, Willy>based on past data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13484-0
01:59:52.638 --> 01:59:56.231
<v Galligan, Willy>And it's very scalable too and can
provide a lot of different insights.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13484-1
01:59:56.231 --> 01:59:57.678
<v Galligan, Willy>And like I mentioned earlier.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13507-0
01:59:58.028 --> 02:00:00.680
<v Galligan, Willy>The real world application of a model
like this,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13507-1
02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:04.145
<v Galligan, Willy>I'm sure there's already institutions
that are implementing it,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13507-2
02:00:04.145 --> 02:00:06.148
<v Galligan, Willy>but we just wanted to create our own.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13519-0
02:00:09.388 --> 02:00:11.895
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yep.
So just moving into the project statement</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13519-1
02:00:11.895 --> 02:00:12.588
<v Mertens, Aidric>in the scope.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13531-0
02:00:13.268 --> 02:00:16.811
<v Mertens, Aidric>So as we mentioned,
we're building a neural network based on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13531-1
02:00:16.811 --> 02:00:17.508
<v Mertens, Aidric>credit risk.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13544-0
02:00:17.868 --> 02:00:21.708
<v Mertens, Aidric>We want to flag it before it hits the
P&amp;L for for these companies.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13551-0
02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:25.348
<v Mertens, Aidric>That's the main, you know, driver of this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13558-0
02:00:26.068 --> 02:00:30.508
<v Mertens, Aidric>That's the main reason why we have this
project to begin with.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13573-0
02:00:32.118 --> 02:00:35.559
<v Mertens, Aidric>It might seem like a little bit overkill
for this project,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13573-1
02:00:35.559 --> 02:00:38.358
<v Mertens, Aidric>but we're just beginning to benchmark it
again.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13598-0
02:00:38.628 --> 02:00:44.077
<v Mertens, Aidric>This more simple models and it turns out
that the accuracy even compared to a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13598-1
02:00:44.077 --> 02:00:48.268
<v Mertens, Aidric>simple linear regression is actually a
little bit stronger.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13609-0
02:00:48.268 --> 02:00:51.896
<v Mertens, Aidric>And maybe that's just due to the
variables that are getting input into the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13609-1
02:00:51.896 --> 02:00:52.428
<v Mertens, Aidric>model, but.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13623-0
02:00:54.238 --> 02:00:57.638
<v Mertens, Aidric>We have to handle sparse like default
rates.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13628-0
02:00:57.638 --> 02:01:00.038
<v Mertens, Aidric>There's a lot of missing borrower fields.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13637-0
02:01:01.838 --> 02:01:04.358
<v Mertens, Aidric>In success for us,
for this means a low RMSE.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13646-0
02:01:06.798 --> 02:01:09.758
<v Mertens, Aidric>Loss estimates plus solid default
detection.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13658-0
02:01:10.148 --> 02:01:15.028
<v Mertens, Aidric>Like a 01 will that will be able to
predict it based on that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13685-0
02:01:19.248 --> 02:01:21.937
<v Mertens, Aidric>So yeah,
just moving into the techniques and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13685-1
02:01:21.937 --> 02:01:26.598
<v Mertens, Aidric>methodologies before I start this page,
I just want to say that we built this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13685-2
02:01:26.598 --> 02:01:29.048
<v Mertens, Aidric>just to learn more about neural networks.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13697-0
02:01:29.288 --> 02:01:34.328
<v Mertens, Aidric>It's pretty complex and just making the
the model framework took a lot of time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13726-0
02:01:35.838 --> 02:01:40.824
<v Mertens, Aidric>And one other thing is other groups said
having the input data is really crucial</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13726-1
02:01:40.824 --> 02:01:44.025
<v Mertens, Aidric>and found that out the hard way after we
are ready,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13726-2
02:01:44.025 --> 02:01:48.518
<v Mertens, Aidric>built the model and the accuracy was
really poor and there was a lot of.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13739-0
02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:52.034
<v Mertens, Aidric>You know,
a lot of missing fields that we had to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13739-1
02:01:52.034 --> 02:01:53.068
<v Mertens, Aidric>use Python code.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13756-0
02:01:54.958 --> 02:02:01.198
<v Mertens, Aidric>To normalize but to the right,
here is the initial well after our third</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13756-1
02:02:01.198 --> 02:02:03.278
<v Mertens, Aidric>iteration or so results.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13760-0
02:02:04.918 --> 02:02:05.398
<v Mertens, Aidric>It does.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13780-0
02:02:05.398 --> 02:02:10.403
<v Mertens, Aidric>It is able to predict default and non
default but it's prediction for default</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13780-1
02:02:10.403 --> 02:02:11.558
<v Mertens, Aidric>is is pretty weak.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13797-0
02:02:11.798 --> 02:02:15.603
<v Mertens, Aidric>We have an accuracy of 84%,
but that's mainly coming off of it's</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13797-1
02:02:15.603 --> 02:02:18.238
<v Mertens, Aidric>getting the non default right,
but it's not.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13817-0
02:02:18.708 --> 02:02:24.046
<v Mertens, Aidric>So we're stating the default,
but that F1 score 2 for the non default.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13817-1
02:02:24.046 --> 02:02:24.948
<v Mertens, Aidric>Pretty good.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13825-0
02:02:25.468 --> 02:02:29.268
<v Mertens, Aidric>And it's it beats a coin flip,
at least with AOC.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13840-0
02:02:31.478 --> 02:02:36.747
<v Mertens, Aidric>So we could call that a win for us for
for now at least we might do some more</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13840-1
02:02:36.747 --> 02:02:38.638
<v Mertens, Aidric>iterations beyond this, but.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13863-0
02:02:40.398 --> 02:02:43.262
<v Mertens, Aidric>It really underscores the need for having
like rich features,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13863-1
02:02:43.262 --> 02:02:46.958
<v Mertens, Aidric>making sure that those features actually
matter to what's going into the model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13865-0
02:02:47.198 --> 02:02:49.918
<v Mertens, Aidric>We had the model way the the feature.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13893-0
02:02:51.668 --> 02:02:54.771
<v Mertens, Aidric>To be able to optimize it a little bit
better,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13893-1
02:02:54.771 --> 02:02:59.988
<v Mertens, Aidric>it performed about 5% more accurate just
from that little change in weighting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13902-0
02:02:59.988 --> 02:03:03.388
<v Mertens, Aidric>But I think that there could still be
further refinement.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13913-0
02:03:06.098 --> 02:03:08.487
<v Mertens, Aidric>So yeah,
moving into the data sources and the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13913-1
02:03:08.487 --> 02:03:09.058
<v Mertens, Aidric>processing.</v>

02:03:09.058 --> 02:03:11.298
<v Mertens, Aidric>So we drew on three key pillars.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13930-0
02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:14.778
<v Mertens, Aidric>It was the loan origination data that
came from the SBA.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13972-0
02:03:16.558 --> 02:03:21.143
<v Mertens, Aidric>It included performance records if they
defaulted or not when they defaulted.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13972-1
02:03:21.143 --> 02:03:25.611
<v Mertens, Aidric>How much a loan was for some of the
things that we some of the variables we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13972-2
02:03:25.611 --> 02:03:29.785
<v Mertens, Aidric>had from that was if they had collateral
with them, how many employee,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13972-3
02:03:29.785 --> 02:03:32.078
<v Mertens, Aidric>how many jobs are supported by this lo?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13979-0
02:03:32.518 --> 02:03:35.038
<v Mertens, Aidric>And then we also used a lot of Fred data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/13990-0
02:03:35.828 --> 02:03:39.748
<v Mertens, Aidric>GDP growth, unemployment rate,
the industrial output.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14007-0
02:03:42.968 --> 02:03:47.636
<v Mertens, Aidric>But once again mentioning the challenges
and limitations of this data was pretty</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14007-1
02:03:47.636 --> 02:03:48.328
<v Mertens, Aidric>hard to get.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14026-0
02:03:48.968 --> 02:03:56.538
<v Mertens, Aidric>The SBA had 530 thousand row or different
loan originations that we traded this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14026-1
02:03:56.538 --> 02:03:57.768
<v Mertens, Aidric>model off of.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14046-0
02:03:57.768 --> 02:04:01.642
<v Mertens, Aidric>So we did have a lot of data there,
but just even,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14046-1
02:04:01.642 --> 02:04:05.288
<v Mertens, Aidric>say GDP that comes out quarterly from the
Fred.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14050-0
02:04:05.288 --> 02:04:07.968
<v Mertens, Aidric>So we normalize that to be monthly.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14059-0
02:04:08.678 --> 02:04:12.118
<v Mertens, Aidric>As you can see in the graph to the right,
just so I was able to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14069-0
02:04:13.148 --> 02:04:16.548
<v Mertens, Aidric>Match up with all those other variables
that were monthly.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14085-0
02:04:19.048 --> 02:04:22.848
<v Mertens, Aidric>And then here's just some of the
variables that we put into the model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14088-0
02:04:22.848 --> 02:04:23.528
<v Mertens, Aidric>And what they look like?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14096-0
02:04:25.038 --> 02:04:27.198
<v Mertens, Aidric>In the middle you can see the confusion
matrix.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14117-0
02:04:28.878 --> 02:04:34.598
<v Mertens, Aidric>It does show that we did nail 10,
242 correct non defaults.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14129-0
02:04:34.838 --> 02:04:39.848
<v Mertens, Aidric>We did get not many,
but we did get some right correctly</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14129-1
02:04:39.848 --> 02:04:41.518
<v Mertens, Aidric>predicted defaults.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14144-0
02:04:41.518 --> 02:04:46.062
<v Mertens, Aidric>So seeing the getting,
at least for the first couple iterations,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14144-1
02:04:46.062 --> 02:04:49.278
<v Mertens, Aidric>having that that mix to work from from
there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14162-0
02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:55.026
<v Mertens, Aidric>Or at least the model is able to actually
correctly predict some from both sides of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14162-1
02:04:55.026 --> 02:04:55.548
<v Mertens, Aidric>the ale.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14180-0
02:05:00.298 --> 02:05:03.473
<v Mertens, Aidric>And then just for the results and
prototype. So in the top right here,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14180-1
02:05:03.473 --> 02:05:05.978
<v Mertens, Aidric>that was the first model that we were
going to go with.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14207-0
02:05:08.078 --> 02:05:12.194
<v Mertens, Aidric>Kind of realized we wanted to get
something more complex and wish that we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14207-1
02:05:12.194 --> 02:05:16.421
<v Mertens, Aidric>didn't do that because ended up kind of
biting us in the **** a little bit.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14207-2
02:05:16.421 --> 02:05:17.478
<v Mertens, Aidric>But with our first.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14217-0
02:05:19.198 --> 02:05:23.278
<v Mertens, Aidric>Prototype it was about 30% accurate,
which was terrible.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14234-0
02:05:25.118 --> 02:05:27.616
<v Mertens, Aidric>You're better off just flipping a coin at
that point.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14234-1
02:05:27.616 --> 02:05:30.438
<v Mertens, Aidric>Eventually through a couple iterations we
got above that 50.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14246-0
02:05:30.708 --> 02:05:37.348
<v Mertens, Aidric>50% so that is at least a little bit
better than than flipping a coin.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14271-0
02:05:40.608 --> 02:05:44.024
<v Mertens, Aidric>We also threw out time we didn't start
with the best source,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14271-1
02:05:44.024 --> 02:05:46.936
<v Mertens, Aidric>so we just kept cleaning up the sources
as we went,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14271-2
02:05:46.936 --> 02:05:50.128
<v Mertens, Aidric>which also made the the data a little bit
richer for us.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14280-0
02:05:51.638 --> 02:05:54.758
<v Mertens, Aidric>But still just need to keep iterating
this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14282-0
02:05:56.358 --> 02:05:56.638
<v Mertens, Aidric>Further.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14308-0
02:06:03.708 --> 02:06:07.869
<v Galligan, Willy>After kinda going through the model and
our iterations here,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14308-1
02:06:07.869 --> 02:06:13.191
<v Galligan, Willy>we wanted to share some next steps and
some possible improvements for further</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14308-2
02:06:13.191 --> 02:06:14.828
<v Galligan, Willy>iterations in the model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14336-0
02:06:16.238 --> 02:06:19.690
<v Galligan, Willy>So we have developed a strong base so far
the model,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14336-1
02:06:19.690 --> 02:06:24.053
<v Galligan, Willy>but there are some immediate things that
we can do to clean it up.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14336-2
02:06:24.053 --> 02:06:26.398
<v Galligan, Willy>First being error diagnosis section.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14346-0
02:06:28.158 --> 02:06:29.958
<v Galligan, Willy>That would be useful for the user.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14349-0
02:06:29.958 --> 02:06:32.558
<v Galligan, Willy>So if this were theoretically to go out
to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14355-0
02:06:33.668 --> 02:06:35.668
<v Galligan, Willy>Institutional forecasting teams.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14371-0
02:06:37.118 --> 02:06:43.101
<v Galligan, Willy>A module to allow them to easily view and
manipulate areas of the model that fail</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14371-1
02:06:43.101 --> 02:06:43.758
<v Galligan, Willy>the most.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14380-0
02:06:45.478 --> 02:06:46.598
<v Galligan, Willy>A comparison module.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14419-0
02:06:46.598 --> 02:06:50.106
<v Galligan, Willy>I think we have both agreed.
Would be very interesting too.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14419-1
02:06:50.106 --> 02:06:54.726
<v Galligan, Willy>Comparing this model driven by neural
networks against more of a legacy model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14419-2
02:06:54.726 --> 02:06:59.053
<v Galligan, Willy>I think I would provide a good sense
check because especially when you're</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14419-3
02:06:59.053 --> 02:07:02.678
<v Galligan, Willy>going into a more complicated models like
this, it's good to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14431-0
02:07:03.228 --> 02:07:08.720
<v Galligan, Willy>To kinda check back on what you know just
to get a sense of the delta between the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14431-1
02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:08.988
<v Galligan, Willy>two.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14445-0
02:07:10.518 --> 02:07:14.737
<v Galligan, Willy>And another area to improve in our
analysis is data sources.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14445-1
02:07:14.737 --> 02:07:17.158
<v Galligan, Willy>In the real World, Bank would have.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14457-0
02:07:18.798 --> 02:07:22.278
<v Galligan, Willy>Every data point imaginable on their loan
originations.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14481-0
02:07:22.278 --> 02:07:26.616
<v Galligan, Willy>So that'd be something that we don't
think would be a huge problem.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14481-1
02:07:26.616 --> 02:07:31.783
<v Galligan, Willy>But in their in the intermediate it is
and then some long term enhancements that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14481-2
02:07:31.783 --> 02:07:34.398
<v Galligan, Willy>could be added to improve the robustness.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14486-0
02:07:35.028 --> 02:07:36.868
<v Galligan, Willy>Robustness of the model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14529-0
02:07:38.678 --> 02:07:44.866
<v Galligan, Willy>In augment feature engineering to enhance
existing variables through the creation</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14529-1
02:07:44.866 --> 02:07:50.602
<v Galligan, Willy>of things like interaction terms,
dummy variables and also lagged variables</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14529-2
02:07:50.602 --> 02:07:54.677
<v Galligan, Willy>as well as consistent back testing
schedule for this,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14529-3
02:07:54.677 --> 02:08:00.790
<v Galligan, Willy>just to see how the performance drifts
away from previous quarters would also be</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14529-4
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:01.998
<v Galligan, Willy>very beneficial.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14551-0
02:08:05.888 --> 02:08:10.401
<v Galligan, Willy>And then since this project was
essentially trying to create our own</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14551-1
02:08:10.401 --> 02:08:13.934
<v Galligan, Willy>neural network,
we had a lot of reflections and great</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14551-2
02:08:13.934 --> 02:08:15.438
<v Galligan, Willy>learning opportunities.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14560-0
02:08:16.288 --> 02:08:20.368
<v Galligan, Willy>Probably biggest thing was if your data
set is not.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14573-0
02:08:21.838 --> 02:08:25.438
<v Galligan, Willy>Holistic in nature and is kind of dirty
in a sense.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14587-0
02:08:25.518 --> 02:08:27.623
<v Galligan, Willy>It makes the actual modeling very
difficult.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14587-1
02:08:27.623 --> 02:08:31.038
<v Galligan, Willy>'cause you have a whole new set of
challenges that you need to overcome.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14605-0
02:08:31.718 --> 02:08:35.387
<v Galligan, Willy>We talked about this week after week and
it was something that constantly came up</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14605-1
02:08:35.387 --> 02:08:37.758
<v Galligan, Willy>and we went through a lot of different
data sources.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14614-0
02:08:39.438 --> 02:08:42.238
<v Galligan, Willy>And then found the SBA data to be the
best.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14618-0
02:08:43.958 --> 02:08:44.838
<v Galligan, Willy>Yeah. Overall, just.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14645-0
02:08:45.108 --> 02:08:49.994
<v Galligan, Willy>Really seeing the complexity of neural
networks and I can only imagine what</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14645-1
02:08:49.994 --> 02:08:55.331
<v Galligan, Willy>institutional version of this would look
like compared to what we've produced thus</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14645-2
02:08:55.331 --> 02:08:55.588
<v Galligan, Willy>far.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14659-0
02:09:02.578 --> 02:09:05.058
<v Mertens, Aidric>Thank you ever any questions.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14674-0
02:09:04.008 --> 02:09:08.576
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect. I. Yeah,
I I I do love your your presentation of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14674-1
02:09:08.576 --> 02:09:12.408
<v Hou, Eric>the presentation deck looks pretty neat.
Thank you.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14692-0
02:09:13.008 --> 02:09:19.460
<v Hou, Eric>So my question will be you you said you
would like to have some benchmarks in the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14692-1
02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:22.528
<v Hou, Eric>future steps like what blocks you guys?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14698-0
02:09:23.918 --> 02:09:25.198
<v Hou, Eric>Creating some benchmark from the
beginning.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14706-0
02:09:27.988 --> 02:09:29.108
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yeah, that's a good question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14743-0
02:09:29.268 --> 02:09:34.628
<v Mertens, Aidric>I think it was just the the initial
complexity of it kind of was overwhelming.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14743-1
02:09:34.628 --> 02:09:39.648
<v Mertens, Aidric>And then just keep working to get that
accuracy better and then you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14724-0
02:09:35.648 --> 02:09:36.048
<v Hou, Eric>Hello.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14743-2
02:09:39.648 --> 02:09:43.108
<v Mertens, Aidric>now feel that it accuracy's at a semi
decent spot.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14757-0
02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:48.708
<v Mertens, Aidric>So then started even earlier today,
just building out a linear regression.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14769-0
02:09:48.708 --> 02:09:52.617
<v Mertens, Aidric>The benchmark it against and and then you
know random forest probably as well.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14769-1
02:09:52.617 --> 02:09:53.508
<v Mertens, Aidric>We're going to do.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14785-0
02:09:55.038 --> 02:09:59.095
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So,
so you know this problem will be oh, oh,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14785-1
02:09:59.095 --> 02:10:01.358
<v Hou, Eric>sorry. I just set up a timer.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14787-0
02:10:01.358 --> 02:10:01.798
<v Hou, Eric>I forgot.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14792-0
02:10:04.478 --> 02:10:05.438
<v Hou, Eric>It's just pretty loud.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14797-0
02:10:06.358 --> 02:10:08.238
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, because I I was.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14808-0
02:10:08.558 --> 02:10:15.078
<v Hou, Eric>I think that maybe you know this problem
will be really difficult to solve, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14816-0
02:10:15.078 --> 02:10:18.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then maybe you have like some
benchmarks, some really quick model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14848-0
02:10:18.268 --> 02:10:22.765
<v Hou, Eric>As you mentioned, in the next step, right,
so that if you have really quick models</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14848-1
02:10:22.765 --> 02:10:25.637
<v Hou, Eric>so they can help you understand well,
you know what,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14848-2
02:10:25.637 --> 02:10:29.863
<v Hou, Eric>it's a really hard problem to solve and
maybe you can try different models to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14848-3
02:10:29.863 --> 02:10:32.518
<v Hou, Eric>solve this problem and then try to
explore more.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14850-0
02:10:32.518 --> 02:10:32.908
<v Hou, Eric>Data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14872-0
02:10:34.438 --> 02:10:37.222
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah,
so I I will say maybe setting up the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14872-1
02:10:37.222 --> 02:10:40.247
<v Hou, Eric>benchmark,
although the benchmark will be really,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14872-2
02:10:40.247 --> 02:10:43.878
<v Hou, Eric>really bad will be a really good you know
first step to do.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14877-0
02:10:46.078 --> 02:10:47.478
<v Hou, Eric>And the second question.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14881-0
02:10:47.868 --> 02:10:48.868
<v Hou, Eric>I will be.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14887-0
02:10:48.988 --> 02:10:51.868
<v Hou, Eric>It may not have an answer,
but I still wanna ask.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14899-0
02:10:51.908 --> 02:10:56.628
<v Hou, Eric>So you you guys mentioned like you want
to have more better data?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14906-0
02:10:57.918 --> 02:10:59.438
<v Hou, Eric>Like what exactly?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14907-0
02:10:59.438 --> 02:11:01.038
<v Hou, Eric>The data source.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14914-0
02:11:01.038 --> 02:11:04.678
<v Hou, Eric>You'll be exploring to add, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14922-0
02:11:04.678 --> 02:11:07.958
<v Hou, Eric>So the data may exist or the data may not
even exist.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14928-0
02:11:07.958 --> 02:11:09.798
<v Hou, Eric>So it is what it is, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14931-0
02:11:09.798 --> 02:11:11.718
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then any thought on that?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14945-0
02:11:16.738 --> 02:11:20.831
<v Galligan, Willy>Well,
so first we started looking at busy S&amp;</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14945-1
02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:22.418
<v Galligan, Willy>P 500 constituents.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14947-0
02:11:22.988 --> 02:11:23.188
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14951-0
02:11:23.918 --> 02:11:25.078
<v Galligan, Willy>And found that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14979-0
02:11:27.078 --> 02:11:31.079
<v Galligan, Willy>Essentially,
in order to gather a large enough data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14979-1
02:11:31.079 --> 02:11:36.927
<v Galligan, Willy>source through market data providers,
the actual variables that are listed,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14979-2
02:11:36.927 --> 02:11:39.158
<v Galligan, Willy>such as net charge off ratio.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14975-0
02:11:37.378 --> 02:11:37.498
<v Hou, Eric>Hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14991-0
02:11:40.838 --> 02:11:43.649
<v Galligan, Willy>You know,
it's very it's very companywide and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14991-1
02:11:43.649 --> 02:11:45.238
<v Galligan, Willy>balance sheet wide ratios.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/14993-0
02:11:46.108 --> 02:11:46.308
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15013-0
02:11:46.308 --> 02:11:49.244
<v Galligan, Willy>And I think you know,
if this model were to,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15013-1
02:11:49.244 --> 02:11:53.876
<v Galligan, Willy>I mean be essentially used for
forecasting in individual banks balance</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15013-2
02:11:53.876 --> 02:11:54.268
<v Galligan, Willy>sheet.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15039-0
02:11:55.958 --> 02:12:01.027
<v Galligan, Willy>And you need much more granular data from
that and you know it's just very</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15039-1
02:12:01.027 --> 02:12:05.758
<v Galligan, Willy>difficult to find line by line
originations from a large institution.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15061-0
02:12:06.278 --> 02:12:10.358
<v Galligan, Willy>So I think that's, you know,
we're going into this without the data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15061-1
02:12:10.358 --> 02:12:15.158
<v Galligan, Willy>that you really need for this model to
truly work in the sense that it was made</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15061-2
02:12:15.158 --> 02:12:15.398
<v Galligan, Willy>for.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15092-0
02:12:15.668 --> 02:12:18.338
<v Galligan, Willy>Isn't necessarily something that we can
get,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15092-1
02:12:18.338 --> 02:12:22.433
<v Galligan, Willy>but through this process we're just
trying to find kind of the best,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15092-2
02:12:22.433 --> 02:12:26.468
<v Galligan, Willy>best data sources and variables that we
can use. Tele get us close.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15081-0
02:12:22.838 --> 02:12:22.958
<v Hou, Eric>Hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15091-0
02:12:25.538 --> 02:12:26.298
<v Hou, Eric>Sure.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15095-0
02:12:27.608 --> 02:12:28.048
<v Hou, Eric>Got it.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15097-0
02:12:28.088 --> 02:12:29.528
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect. Thank you.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15104-0
02:12:31.038 --> 02:12:31.638
<v Hou, Eric>Great, great work.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15101-0
02:12:31.218 --> 02:12:31.778
<v Galligan, Willy>Of course.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15107-0
02:12:31.958 --> 02:12:34.118
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. Thank you so much. All right.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15106-0

02:12:35.718 --> 02:12:37.358
<v Hou, Eric>Last, the group Group 2.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15115-0
02:12:41.928 --> 02:12:43.168
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I'm not sure my screen real quick.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15116-0
02:12:44.218 --> 02:12:44.698
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15119-0
02:12:47.748 --> 02:12:48.708
<v Hou, Eric>Natural market.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15137-0
02:12:55.108 --> 02:12:59.231
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>All right,
so turn it up and it's Patrick Kalbeck</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15137-1
02:12:59.231 --> 02:13:01.788
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>myself and will ham my partner.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15153-0
02:13:01.788 --> 02:13:08.463
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>We did a grocery product pricing analysis
specifically focused on metro market for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15153-1
02:13:08.463 --> 02:13:09.508
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>data reasons.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15180-0
02:13:10.268 --> 02:13:13.815
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So the core problem here is grocery
products. The prices, you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15180-1
02:13:13.815 --> 02:13:17.414
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>they're influenced by a lot of things,
could be sized product sized,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15180-2
02:13:17.414 --> 02:13:19.188
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>product servings, the ingredients.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15197-0
02:13:19.998 --> 02:13:22.752
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Competition.
Many different things that go into</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15197-1
02:13:22.752 --> 02:13:25.678

02:13:27.268 --> 02:13:32.535
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>This requires us to be very data-driven
and for a company to be very data-driven</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15232-1
02:13:32.535 --> 02:13:37.607
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>when they're pricing these products and
when you're trying to develop dynamic</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15232-2
02:13:37.607 --> 02:13:40.598
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>pricing,
you need to focus on the data to get</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15232-3
02:13:40.598 --> 02:13:40.988
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15249-0
02:13:41.028 --> 02:13:46.312
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So the scope of this project we primarily
focused on metro market due to the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15249-1
02:13:46.312 --> 02:13:48.508
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>availability of the data online.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15263-0
02:13:49.028 --> 02:13:52.108
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So going into this project,
you know our questions starting out where</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15263-1
02:13:52.108 --> 02:13:54.748
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>what was the best model for us to use to
determine pricing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15286-0
02:13:55.148 --> 02:13:59.243
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Go further along in the slides,
we'll go over that and then we're also</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15286-1
02:13:59.243 --> 02:14:02.647
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>considering, you know,
what attribute or what quality of a</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15286-2
02:14:02.647 --> 02:14:03.108
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>product.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15305-0
02:14:04.598 --> 02:14:07.809
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>It most influences the product's price,
so that could be anything from serving</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15305-1
02:14:07.809 --> 02:14:09.638
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>size or ingredients like I mentioned
before.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15309-0
02:14:11.878 --> 02:14:13.278
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So why is this relevant?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15342-0
02:14:13.558 --> 02:14:17.130
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>A lot of the presentations have been
about, you know, picking stocks,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15342-1
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:19.886
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>things like that.
But for focused on pricing products</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15342-2
02:14:19.886 --> 02:14:23.917
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>accurately and that's because, you know,
product pricing really helps to drive</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15342-3
02:14:23.917 --> 02:14:25.958
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>revenue and profitability for a company.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15367-0
02:14:26.118 --> 02:14:31.151
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Mispriced products causes lost sales,
which drives lower margins and lost sales</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15367-1
02:14:31.151 --> 02:14:35.051
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>can cause, you know,
excess inventory and a product price too</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15367-2
02:14:35.051 --> 02:14:40.021
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>low could cause increased demand and then
you know not enough inventory to get</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15367-3
02:14:40.021 --> 02:14:40.398
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15402-0
02:14:40.588 --> 02:14:44.374
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So you really want to be on point with
your pricing, especially in grocery,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15402-1
02:14:44.374 --> 02:14:48.060
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>which is known as one of the most
competitive industries when it comes to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15402-2
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:51.746
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>pricing and it's challenging for
companies to get their products into the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15402-3
02:14:51.746 --> 02:14:54.038
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>store in the 1st place.
And if you get there.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15436-0
02:14:54.038 --> 02:14:58.068
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>You definitely want to make sure that
your product is priced accurately,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15436-1
02:14:58.068 --> 02:15:01.932
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and as I mentioned previously,
you know dynamic pricing really allows</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15436-2
02:15:01.932 --> 02:15:06.348
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>companies to increase the revenue and
profitability and increase those margins.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15443-0
02:15:07.118 --> 02:15:08.958
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>During times when inputs are changing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15483-0
02:15:09.548 --> 02:15:12.920
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>You know, for example,
right now with tariffs going on,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15483-1
02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:17.858
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>input price could be changing a certain
ingredient in a product and it's nice for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15483-2
02:15:17.858 --> 02:15:22.495
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>the the grocery store like Metro market
for example to be able to accurately</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15483-3
02:15:22.495 --> 02:15:26.228
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>predict that coming and make adjustments
to you know support.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15508-0
02:15:27.678 --> 02:15:31.482
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Margins going forward with that
additional change and what's the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15508-1
02:15:31.482 --> 02:15:34.876
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>strategic value here for for a company
like Metro Market,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15508-2
02:15:34.876 --> 02:15:39.089
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>you know better understanding of how
these products are priced based on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15508-3
02:15:39.089 --> 02:15:40.318
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>different attributes.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15532-0
02:15:40.868 --> 02:15:44.096
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Of the product,
you know things that can be driven off of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15532-1
02:15:44.096 --> 02:15:48.382
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>these tools are targeted promotions.
If we see one of the characteristics we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15532-2
02:15:48.382 --> 02:15:50.108
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>looked at was customer reviews.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15571-0
02:15:50.108 --> 02:15:54.447
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So if we see a very high customer review,
you know consistently for a product,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15571-1
02:15:54.447 --> 02:15:59.005
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>you know I might want to run a promotion
up the price there a little bit you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15571-2
02:15:59.005 --> 02:16:03.234
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>get some premium pricing going within
that promotion based on the input data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15571-3
02:16:03.234 --> 02:16:04.278
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>that we are seeing.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15573-0
02:16:04.428 --> 02:16:05.308
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Into these.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15577-0
02:16:06.238 --> 02:16:07.478
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Models that we developed.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15619-0
02:16:10.478 --> 02:16:14.147
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So what do we use here for mlai
techniques started out with AK and N</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15619-1
02:16:14.147 --> 02:16:17.551
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>model similar to other groups,
just to build that baseline out,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15619-2
02:16:17.551 --> 02:16:21.646
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and I thought this was a good model
because a lot of these products are most</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15619-3
02:16:21.646 --> 02:16:24.358
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>likely priced similarly.
If you consider like BRE.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15650-0
02:16:24.358 --> 02:16:27.142
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>For example,
you know there's probably not a huge</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15650-1
02:16:27.142 --> 02:16:30.651
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>difference between one bread to the other
in terms of pricing,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15650-2
02:16:30.651 --> 02:16:34.437
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and you know that is a assumption,
but that's most likely the case.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15650-3
02:16:34.437 --> 02:16:37.723
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And we did get a good,
good standard there from the K&amp;</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15650-4
02:16:37.723 --> 02:16:38.558
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>N model and we.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15655-0
02:16:38.558 --> 02:16:39.638
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Were able to work off that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15691-0
02:16:40.138 --> 02:16:44.918
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>The next the other model we use was the
decision tree and also a pretty simple</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15691-1
02:16:44.918 --> 02:16:48.730
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>model based off rules.
A lot of you know kind of if statements</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15691-2
02:16:48.730 --> 02:16:53.632
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and the structure really helps to show
you know the uninformed view or how these</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15691-3
02:16:53.632 --> 02:16:55.568
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>features drag price you know in.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15723-0
02:16:55.558 --> 02:16:59.175
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>This case considering if I were a data
analyst at Metro Market,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15723-1
02:16:59.175 --> 02:17:01.662
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I need to present my findings to,
you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15723-2
02:17:01.662 --> 02:17:06.071
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>the boardroom or someone who is not as
intricately into the details of myself</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15723-3
02:17:06.071 --> 02:17:08.558
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and the tree model really helps me do
that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15765-0
02:17:09.428 --> 02:17:14.645
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And then lastly, the random forest model,
you know really a very accurate model as</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15765-1
02:17:14.645 --> 02:17:19.799
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>other groups have mentioned and we kind
of saw the same and we did expect this to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15765-2
02:17:19.799 --> 02:17:24.891
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>be the most accurate going in given the
variables or the features we are working</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15765-3
02:17:24.891 --> 02:17:25.708
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>with in this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15777-0
02:17:26.348 --> 02:17:29.922
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Model.
So going on to the data that we used will</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15771-0
02:17:27.948 --> 02:17:28.148
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15777-1
02:17:29.922 --> 02:17:31.308
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>will touch on this.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15818-0
02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:42.142
<v Halm, William>So the first issue that we ran into when
we decided to try to predict the prices</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15818-1
02:17:42.142 --> 02:17:47.077
<v Halm, William>was that there is no easily accessible
database of food information.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15818-2
02:17:47.077 --> 02:17:51.726
<v Halm, William>So unlike stock trading,
there's just nowhere that we could find</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15818-3
02:17:51.726 --> 02:17:53.228
<v Halm, William>that had food prices.</v>

02:17:53.428 --> 02:17:59.946
<v Halm, William>So we decided to make a web scraper and
create our own database of the option of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15834-1

02:18:01.158 --> 02:18:04.678
<v Halm, William>Prices and we use metro Markets website
because they had.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15851-0
02:18:04.868 --> 02:18:07.828
<v Halm, William>The most consistent format when it came
to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15859-0
02:18:10.838 --> 02:18:13.518
<v Halm, William>The HTML classes of the information.</v>

02:18:20.478 --> 02:18:25.611
<v Halm, William>So for getting the data we started with
just some links to the different sections</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15889-1
02:18:25.611 --> 02:18:28.678
<v Halm, William>of the metro market page,
starting with all the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15934-0
02:18:29.908 --> 02:18:35.924
<v Halm, William>Products that started with A and then BC
all the way to Z and then we used API to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15934-1
02:18:35.924 --> 02:18:40.619
<v Halm, William>take each link and retrieve all of the
HTML associated with it,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15934-2
02:18:40.619 --> 02:18:45.388
<v Halm, William>which then left us with a very long list
of product information.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15958-0
02:18:45.588 --> 02:18:50.082
<v Halm, William>Ended up being a little over 100,
000 characters for each individual</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15958-1
02:18:50.082 --> 02:18:53.339
<v Halm, William>product,
so it took a lot of effort to synthesize</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15958-2
02:18:53.339 --> 02:18:57.508
<v Halm, William>it into just one list that contained the
names, prices, brands.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15961-0
02:18:58.238 --> 02:18:58.878
<v Halm, William>And a couple other.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15996-0
02:19:00.028 --> 02:19:03.427
<v Halm, William>Metrics,
but eventually we were able to get an</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15996-1
02:19:03.427 --> 02:19:08.201
<v Halm, William>output that looked pretty good,
though it did take a long time to</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15996-2
02:19:08.201 --> 02:19:11.962
<v Halm, William>calculate.
It took over half an hour to run the web</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15996-3
02:19:11.962 --> 02:19:18.038
<v Halm, William>scraper and then it took almost 5 minutes
alone in the to do the the formulas just.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/15999-0
02:19:18.148 --> 02:19:19.948
<v Halm, William>Them down took awhile.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16015-0
02:19:21.478 --> 02:19:26.076
<v Halm, William>So using more data would take even longer,
but it was doable and we got some some</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16015-1
02:19:26.076 --> 02:19:27.478
<v Halm, William>pretty good data outputs.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16032-0
02:19:32.328 --> 02:19:37.008
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Awesome. So the results of the K&amp;M,
this is like our baseline again.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16071-0
02:19:37.408 --> 02:19:42.570
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So we were able to see that, you know,
for some of these lower priced items were</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16071-1
02:19:42.570 --> 02:19:45.948
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>somewhat accurate with the K&amp;N model.
And again,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16071-2
02:19:45.948 --> 02:19:51.174
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>we are seeing patterns for products with
similar features that we were looking at</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16071-3
02:19:51.174 --> 02:19:54.488
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>like ingredients,
but we had trouble looking at or.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16086-0
02:19:54.478 --> 02:19:59.052
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Determining any prices for any products
you know higher in price,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16086-1
02:19:59.052 --> 02:20:01.478
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>as you can see in the picture here.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16096-0
02:20:01.628 --> 02:20:04.708
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And you know,
this is greatly dependent on the data</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16096-1
02:20:04.708 --> 02:20:06.308
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>sets that we are inputting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16126-0
02:20:07.838 --> 02:20:11.290
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>As I go forward,
I'll talk a little bit more about some of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16126-1
02:20:11.290 --> 02:20:15.210
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>the stuff that really affected all of the
models. But for the KNN,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16126-2
02:20:15.210 --> 02:20:19.598
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>it really felt the brunt of the
challenges that we had with the data sets.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16153-0
02:20:21.588 --> 02:20:25.279
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>For the tree model, again,
I think the main reason we wanted to use</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16153-1
02:20:25.279 --> 02:20:29.514
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>this was to get good visualization of the
logic that we are going through and</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16153-2
02:20:29.514 --> 02:20:32.228
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>determining what the price of a product
could be.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16187-0
02:20:32.228 --> 02:20:36.432
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So really seeing you know,
is the weight over this much and so on</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16187-1
02:20:36.432 --> 02:20:39.998
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>and so forth.
And we did see that in the picture that I</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16187-2
02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:44.265
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>showed earlier and this was slightly more
accurate than the K&amp;</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16187-3
02:20:44.265 --> 02:20:48.278
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>N model and much better at predicting the
higher priced items.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16194-0
02:20:48.428 --> 02:20:49.988
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Although the lower priced items.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16197-0
02:20:50.678 --> 02:20:51.238
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Still seem.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16235-0
02:20:51.828 --> 02:20:55.293
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>To, you know,
be a little bit hit or miss and again we</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16235-1
02:20:55.293 --> 02:20:58.003
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>can,
you know the data set did 'cause some</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16235-2
02:20:58.003 --> 02:21:00.775
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>instability here and there was
overfitting,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16235-3
02:21:00.775 --> 02:21:05.816
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>which I think is probably why we were
able to have a little bit better accuracy</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16235-4
02:21:05.816 --> 02:21:07.958
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>with the higher priced items, but.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16256-0
02:21:07.958 --> 02:21:13.168
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>We saw similar issues in the lower priced
items or medium priced items as we did</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16256-1
02:21:13.168 --> 02:21:15.548
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>with the KNN due to that overfitting.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16274-0
02:21:17.628 --> 02:21:21.389
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And looking at the random forest,
you know I mentioned in the beginning of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16274-1
02:21:21.389 --> 02:21:24.348
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>the presentation was we wanted to figure
out what feature.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16300-0
02:21:25.758 --> 02:21:30.032
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Was driving the pricing the most I think
looking at the graph you can see that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16300-1
02:21:30.032 --> 02:21:34.198
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>weight clearly drove the pricing the most,
which is pretty intuitive, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16309-0
02:21:34.198 --> 02:21:40.078
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>If you buy 24 of something rather than
one in the 24 ways the same.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16328-0
02:21:41.878 --> 02:21:44.966
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>That could cause an issue,
but if the 24 weighs more as you'd expect,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16328-1
02:21:44.966 --> 02:21:46.598
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>it's also most likely more expensive.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16368-0
02:21:46.988 --> 02:21:51.371
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>But I don't think that's where we get the
most value from this model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16368-1
02:21:51.371 --> 02:21:56.131
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I think you know ignoring the weight and
looking more so at like the brand,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16368-2
02:21:56.131 --> 02:22:01.328
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>the ingredients and so on and so forth is
where we really find the value from this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16368-3

<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Part of the more heavy items most likely
going to weigh more because quantity may</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16382-1
02:22:07.771 --> 02:22:08.668

02:22:08.948 --> 02:22:10.788
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>One of the things that I did mention was.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16401-0
02:22:12.238 --> 02:22:14.808
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>The trouble that we're having with the
data set,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16401-1
02:22:14.808 --> 02:22:16.958
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>you know it was good to get quality data.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16426-0
02:22:17.308 --> 02:22:21.727
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Data from the Metro market website.
One of the things is not every product</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16426-1
02:22:21.727 --> 02:22:24.908
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>has the same number of ingredients,
of course, right?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16440-0
02:22:25.588 --> 02:22:28.897
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So ended up, you know,
at this stage looking at the combined</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16440-1
02:22:28.897 --> 02:22:29.548
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>ingredients.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16448-0
02:22:29.548 --> 02:22:32.068
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>So what is the sum of all the ingredients?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16478-0
02:22:32.068 --> 02:22:36.449
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>You know how many ingredients are in this
product rather than really looking at the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16478-1
02:22:36.449 --> 02:22:39.004
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>characteristics of each ingredient.
For example,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16478-2
02:22:39.004 --> 02:22:43.176
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>you know flour versus cornstarch in a
product. We're just looking at, you know,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16478-3
02:22:43.176 --> 02:22:44.428
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>there's two ingredients.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16485-0
02:22:45.198 --> 02:22:47.678
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Instead of the actual characteristics of
the ingredients.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16524-0
02:22:48.028 --> 02:22:53.437
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>But I think going forward that'll be
something to try to dig into a little bit</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16524-1
02:22:53.437 --> 02:22:56.245
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>more,
although that has turned out to be</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16524-2
02:22:56.245 --> 02:23:00.696
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>somewhat challenging to make the model
work as an attended well,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16524-3
02:23:00.696 --> 02:23:05.968

02:23:07.678 --> 02:23:11.339
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>But overall,
the random forest results reduce the</v>

02:23:11.339 --> 02:23:17.198
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>overfitting that we saw and was able to
handle the data set quite a bit better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16551-0
02:23:17.788 --> 02:23:20.148
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And the other models that we used.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16586-0
02:23:22.048 --> 02:23:26.707
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I should mention you know the weakness
here is if I were to try to present this</v>

02:23:26.707 --> 02:23:30.376

it may be more challenging to, you know,</v>

02:23:30.376 --> 02:23:35.152
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>describe exactly what's going on here.
Although as we'll see the overall results,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16586-3
02:23:35.152 --> 02:23:37.598
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>you know, kind of tell the story for them.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16613-0
02:23:37.808 --> 02:23:43.262
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>We see much better performance in the
random forest than the other two models</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16613-1
02:23:43.262 --> 02:23:46.618
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>overall,
although the MSE value is still pretty</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16613-2
02:23:46.618 --> 02:23:46.968
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>high.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16619-0
02:23:46.968 --> 02:23:48.790
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Here,
there's definitely some fine tuning still</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16619-1
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:49.208
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>to be done.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16622-0
02:23:50.438 --> 02:23:51.478
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>On these models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16656-0
02:23:51.868 --> 02:23:56.246
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>And I think a lot of that has to do with
how we're interpreting the data we are</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16656-1
02:23:56.246 --> 02:24:00.131
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>getting from the web scraper,
from the metro market site. Put overall,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16656-2
02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:04.618
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I think we see that the random Forbes is
clearly performing a lot better than the</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16656-3
02:24:04.618 --> 02:24:05.548
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>other two models.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16700-0
02:24:09.328 --> 02:24:13.155
<v Halm, William>All right.
So going into some of the next steps for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16700-1
02:24:13.155 --> 02:24:18.455
<v Halm, William>how we could improve our model.
Firstly a better user interface if this</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16700-2
02:24:18.455 --> 02:24:23.976
<v Halm, William>was to be used by, say, metro market,
we would want to be able to make our</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16700-3
02:24:23.976 --> 02:24:27.288
<v Halm, William>analysis more clear and easy to see we
also.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16732-0
02:24:27.688 --> 02:24:32.304
<v Halm, William>Could use some improvement in our data
collection and processing efficiency.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16732-1
02:24:32.304 --> 02:24:35.361
<v Halm, William>Like I said,
it took over half an hour for the web</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16732-2
02:24:35.361 --> 02:24:38.838
<v Halm, William>scraper to run and then like multiple
minutes every time.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16742-0
02:24:39.028 --> 02:24:43.348
<v Halm, William>A formula was updated so we would wanna
make that better.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16749-0
02:24:43.388 --> 02:24:46.788
<v Halm, William>And then we also really wanna improve our
data consistency.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16757-0
02:24:46.988 --> 02:24:50.388
<v Halm, William>The table in the middle of the page shows
what the.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16771-0
02:24:51.878 --> 02:24:55.394
<v Halm, William>Weight output sometimes is and it can be
all over the board,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16771-1
02:24:55.394 --> 02:24:57.238
<v Halm, William>so just getting those a unified.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16807-0
02:24:58.838 --> 02:25:03.546
<v Halm, William>Specific output is very important and we
can also collect more data,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16807-1
02:25:03.546 --> 02:25:09.277
<v Halm, William>so that's like more nutrition information,
because right now we're just calculating</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16807-2
02:25:09.277 --> 02:25:13.848
<v Halm, William>based on calories and then we could also
include sale information,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16807-3
02:25:13.848 --> 02:25:16.918
<v Halm, William>especially over time,
to see what discounts.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16847-0
02:25:18.268 --> 02:25:23.799
<v Halm, William>Affect the price as well as semantic
analysis of the comments 'cause every</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16847-1
02:25:23.799 --> 02:25:29.773
<v Halm, William>every product has has comments on it and
so seeing what people actually think of</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16847-2
02:25:29.773 --> 02:25:35.673
<v Halm, William>the products does affect the price a lot
as well as analysis of other companies</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16847-3
02:25:35.673 --> 02:25:38.918
<v Halm, William>seeing how, say,
Walmart prices their food.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16865-0
02:25:38.918 --> 02:25:44.015
<v Halm, William>Based on ingredients would be beneficial
and then lastly it would be pretty</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16865-1
02:25:44.015 --> 02:25:46.228
<v Halm, William>difficult to do, but it would be.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16868-0
02:25:46.958 --> 02:25:47.518
<v Halm, William>Cool to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16884-0
02:25:47.948 --> 02:25:54.211
<v Halm, William>You use the future trading price of
ingredients to predict the current price</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16884-1
02:25:54.211 --> 02:25:55.268
<v Halm, William>of a product.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16904-0
02:25:55.268 --> 02:25:58.841
<v Halm, William>So for example,
seeing what the future price of wheat is</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16904-1
02:25:58.841 --> 02:26:03.228
<v Halm, William>and comparing it and seeing how it'll
change the price of say, bread.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16932-0
02:26:07.428 --> 02:26:11.856
<v Halm, William>So for our reflection,
the biggest take away that we had is that</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16932-1
02:26:11.856 --> 02:26:16.353
<v Halm, William>data consistency is key.
The classic saying of garbage in garbage</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16932-2
02:26:16.353 --> 02:26:17.988
<v Halm, William>out really is important.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16948-0
02:26:17.988 --> 02:26:22.564
<v Halm, William>Here we spend a lot of time cleaning our
data and making sure it was accurate,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16948-1
02:26:22.564 --> 02:26:25.228
<v Halm, William>but there's definitely more that we could
do.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16972-0
02:26:25.268 --> 02:26:31.196
<v Halm, William>And so that's that's the biggest take
away for us as well as more models gives</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16972-1
02:26:31.196 --> 02:26:36.598
<v Halm, William>us more insights like the KNN didn't give
too much of an insight as to.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16974-0
02:26:37.178 --> 02:26:38.018
<v Halm, William>Value of.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16996-0
02:26:39.518 --> 02:26:43.909
<v Halm, William>The factors that we're tracking,
but using more models allowed us to get</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/16996-1
02:26:43.909 --> 02:26:47.638
<v Halm, William>more information as well as there's just
no perfect solution.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17033-0
02:26:48.118 --> 02:26:53.487
<v Halm, William>There's a lot of variables that we didn't
take account for that are just very</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17033-1
02:26:53.487 --> 02:26:57.410
<v Halm, William>difficult to do.
So like a lot of like political things,</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17033-2
02:26:57.410 --> 02:27:02.985
<v Halm, William>especially when it comes to ingredients,
because there's tariffs and whatnot for</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17033-3
02:27:02.985 --> 02:27:03.398
<v Halm, William>foods.</v>

02:27:04.598 --> 02:27:05.238
<v Halm, William>And yeah.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17039-0
02:27:07.998 --> 02:27:09.838
<v Halm, William>So any questions?</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17050-0
02:27:12.138 --> 02:27:16.258
<v Hou, Eric>My comment would be like I I I appreciate
the effort, I mean this.</v>

<v Hou, Eric>Certainly.
I mean you guys create your data set</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17062-1

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17086-0
02:27:29.588 --> 02:27:32.748

looked at.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17103-0
02:27:32.748 --> 02:27:35.887

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17128-0
02:27:38.508 --> 02:27:42.546
<v Halm, William>They just have pictures of the products
and then from the pictures you can get</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17107-0
02:27:38.898 --> 02:27:39.258

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17128-1
02:27:42.546 --> 02:27:46.788
<v Halm, William>the information but from just copying the
data there's no way to to get it easily.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17144-0
02:27:47.518 --> 02:27:52.434
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, that, that that's my answer.
In my mind. I just want to confirm that.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17198-0
02:28:14.398 --> 02:28:16.958
<v Hou, Eric>Price to predict whether or not they're
gonna price up or down.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17208-0
02:28:16.958 --> 02:28:20.238
<v Hou, Eric>So I think that's a really good use case
of your model.</v>

dab268bd-6fa7-4002-8466-1e02d587bfa3/17209-0
