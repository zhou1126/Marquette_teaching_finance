00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:06.313
<v Hou, Eric>Is it on?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/24-0
00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:08.693
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/32-0
00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:12.533
<v Hou, Eric>I guess it is OK let me share my screen.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/34-0
00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:21.973
<v Hou, Eric>Here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/38-0
00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:24.423
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/58-0
00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Hou, Eric>Do you already spring break?
I finally have time to create all your</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/58-1
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.943
<v Hou, Eric>homeworks and read through all your
proposals.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/72-0
00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:38.703
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's let's just talk about the
homework and surveys or stuff, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/73-0
00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:39.263
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/78-0
00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.703
<v Hou, Eric>So then, here's the slides.
I'm gonna touch base on that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/85-0
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.093
<v Hou, Eric>So right now, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/97-0
00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:51.453
<v Hou, Eric>So we have seven groups,
group number 123456 and #10.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/104-0
00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:56.533
<v Hou, Eric>So then account of students in each group.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/125-0
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:02.251
<v Hou, Eric>So screw 4 and 10.
Those two group have four students and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/125-1
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:05.753
<v Hou, Eric>group 2:00 and 6:00 they have two
students.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/135-0
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:10.713
<v Hou, Eric>So then on average,
we have three students in each group.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/144-0
00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:15.593
<v Hou, Eric>The good news is we do not have a single
team of one, which is awesome.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/151-0
00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.813
<v Hou, Eric>For the homework, as you can see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/159-0
00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.733
<v Hou, Eric>I think the homework is pretty easy for
you guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/167-0
00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:27.573
<v Hou, Eric>Homework. One average of 5.6 out of 6.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/184-0
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.196
<v Hou, Eric>So relative score is a 93.
25 and homework two.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/184-1
00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.093
<v Hou, Eric>I think that homework just too easy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/188-0
00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.413
<v Hou, Eric>So everyone got a perfect score.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/197-0
00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:40.133
<v Hou, Eric>Six out of six and a relative score is
100.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/216-0
00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:49.813
<v Hou, Eric>Homework 3. The average of 5.45 out of 6,
so relative score is 90.87.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/220-0
00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:52.933
<v Hou, Eric>The proposal is a teamwork right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/222-0
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:53.893
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/230-0
00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.093
<v Hou, Eric>19 out of 20 is a relative score 95.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/241-0
00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:03.863
<v Hou, Eric>The proposal is the mid term score that
you're going to find.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/263-0
00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:13.237
<v Hou, Eric>From Marquette University system I just
remember someone sent me a reminder,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/263-1
00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.563
<v Hou, Eric>asked me to midterm scores.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/269-0
00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:18.683
<v Hou, Eric>So then the proposal score gonna be that
one and.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/271-0
00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:20.453
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty much.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/286-0
00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:27.406
<v Hou, Eric>Majority of the folks got A and then
several folks got a minus and and that's</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/286-1
00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:27.613
<v Hou, Eric>it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/290-0
00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.173
<v Hou, Eric>And then there's no B.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/293-0
00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:29.813
<v Hou, Eric>There's no C.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/297-0
00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:31.533
<v Hou, Eric>There's no D in there,
so no F which is good.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/310-0
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.773
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's pretty much what we have
done in the first half of the class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/314-0
00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:37.523
<v Hou, Eric>Class, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/323-0
00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:41.123
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I will say congratulations.
You guys did a great job.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/331-0
00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:43.933
<v Hou, Eric>Homework isn't super hard.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/333-0
00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:45.413
<v Hou, Eric>And then you guys handle it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/346-0
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:51.853
<v Hou, Eric>But I also received some reminder from
Marquette University.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/353-0
00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:55.493
<v Hou, Eric>You guys know this is a combination of?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/360-0
00:02:57.573 --> 00:02:59.013
<v Hou, Eric>Two classes, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/369-0
00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:01.573
<v Hou, Eric>At least this is what I was told.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/377-0
00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:09.853
<v Hou, Eric>One is undergrad class,
another one is it's graduate level class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/382-0
00:03:11.073 --> 00:03:13.233
<v Hou, Eric>I remember to start with some #5.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/395-0
00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:19.732
<v Hou, Eric>So market University,
remind me that I need to give something</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/395-1
00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.013
<v Hou, Eric>challenging to grad students.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/412-0
00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:30.292
<v Hou, Eric>So then to differentiate this class
between a grad grad class and undergrad</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/412-1
00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:30.813
<v Hou, Eric>class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/427-0
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:35.813
<v Hou, Eric>So now I will have to change the homework
a little bit more.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/429-0
00:03:35.813 --> 00:03:39.173
<v Hou, Eric>It's, you know,
specifically for the grad students.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/439-0
00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:43.723
<v Hou, Eric>Oh please ignore the date.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/447-0
00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.803
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's definitely not 2023.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/456-0
00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:50.283
<v Hou, Eric>I don't wanna go back to 2023 and this is
definitely not November.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/468-0
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.893
<v Hou, Eric>So for the grad students,
you have one additional homework.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/474-0
00:03:56.613 --> 00:03:58.773
<v Hou, Eric>And you have one short.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/482-0
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.693
<v Hou, Eric>Code Oncode final exam.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/485-0
00:04:01.773 --> 00:04:05.093
<v Hou, Eric>That'll be something two additional.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/490-0
00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.533
<v Hou, Eric>Assignments for you guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/492-0
00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:10.663
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/506-0
00:04:12.413 --> 00:04:17.093
<v Hou, Eric>I right now I also need to clarify the
definition of grad students.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/514-0
00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:20.653
<v Hou, Eric>Because let me show you guys what I mean.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/518-0
00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:27.673
<v Hou, Eric>This is ad 2L.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/526-0
00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:38.153
<v Hou, Eric>Into D2L.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/538-0
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:44.433
<v Hou, Eric>We know that this course is FNA 4931 and
five 931.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/545-0
00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.173
<v Hou, Eric>Topics topics in finance, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/574-0
00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:56.707
<v Hou, Eric>So then my I don't know my the definition
of grad students who are the students who</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/574-1
00:04:56.707 --> 00:05:00.973
<v Hou, Eric>registered 5931. If that's the definition.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/586-0
00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:05.925
<v Hou, Eric>So then my definition of grad student who
gonna have additional homework additional</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/586-1
00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:06.573
<v Hou, Eric>final exam?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/606-0
00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna apply to those guys,
but if the definition by Marc and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/606-1
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.323
<v Hou, Eric>University is truly who are the find?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/610-0
00:05:16.363 --> 00:05:17.963
<v Hou, Eric>Who are the grad students?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/626-0
00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:23.843
<v Hou, Eric>Which will be a subset of the students
register for this 5931.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/633-0
00:05:23.883 --> 00:05:28.563
<v Hou, Eric>So then this this requirement will only
apply to those guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/639-0
00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:31.483
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's really depend on how.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/655-0
00:05:32.213 --> 00:05:35.246
<v Hou, Eric>Marquette University is defined in grad
students and how they're gonna</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/655-1
00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:36.613
<v Hou, Eric>differentiate those two classes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/659-0
00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:41.583
<v Hou, Eric>My current guess is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/670-0
00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:45.893
<v Hou, Eric>Whoever registered for this 5931.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/701-0
00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:52.229
<v Hou, Eric>So then those students will have one
additional homework that will be for that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/701-1
00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.319
<v Hou, Eric>individual,
so that you don't you you cannot do it</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/701-2
00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.809
<v Hou, Eric>with your group,
you have to do it individually and the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/701-3
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:02.493
<v Hou, Eric>one short final exam.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/707-0
00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:06.973
<v Hou, Eric>You have to do that on your own as well.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/718-0
00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:11.763
<v Hou, Eric>And that is what I told what I'm told.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/720-0
00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:13.603
<v Hou, Eric>That will I I need to do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/739-0
00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:19.918
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll be I'll be following that policy.
Apologize for that because I do not know</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/739-1
00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:21.013
<v Hou, Eric>that policy exists.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/741-0
00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:22.733
<v Hou, Eric>But now someone remind me that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/743-0
00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:27.083
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/755-0
00:06:28.683 --> 00:06:32.683
<v Haroon, Sufyan>In which week would you add the second
graduate assignment in?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/773-0
00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:40.238
<v Hou, Eric>I will try to give it as soon as possible
and and and I'll give the deadline as of</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/773-1
00:06:40.238 --> 00:06:41.213
<v Hou, Eric>last week, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/800-0
00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'll give it to you sometime
between those weeks and then I'll say</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/800-1
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.213
<v Hou, Eric>just before your final presentation.
Just turn in that homework. That's it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/817-0
00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:55.699
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then I will try to give that
final exam right before you know,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/817-1
00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.693
<v Hou, Eric>one week before the final presentation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/828-0
00:06:58.373 --> 00:07:01.968
<v Hou, Eric>And then if you can just turn it in that
that final homework,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/828-1
00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:04.693
<v Hou, Eric>it gonna be take home,
you can open your book.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/834-0
00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:07.783
<v Hou, Eric>And then just turn in before the final
presentation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/836-0
00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:08.343
<v Hou, Eric>That will be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/859-0
00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:13.457
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right,
so the final exam is going to be much</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/859-1
00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:17.183
<v Haroon, Sufyan>more like the homework assignments we've
been already doing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/867-0
00:07:17.623 --> 00:07:21.983
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Or would it be more a gaps on projects?
Kind of a situation?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/877-0
00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:27.203
<v Hou, Eric>Not decided yet, but what I was told was.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/883-0
00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:30.933
<v Hou, Eric>I need to make it challenging.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/887-0
00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:33.773
<v Hou, Eric>That's why I'm told.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/889-0
00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:35.913
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right. Thanks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/899-0
00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:40.053
<v Hou, Eric>Not, you know, I I don't know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/901-0
00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.733
<v Hou, Eric>I haven't decided how to, you know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/909-0
00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:45.893
<v Hou, Eric>How challenging that will be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/916-0
00:07:45.893 --> 00:07:50.013
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully not super challenging,
but some some work right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/920-0
00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:52.973
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
because you guys are grad students.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/934-0
00:07:54.553 --> 00:07:57.943
<v Hou, Eric>You you should be doing more.
So then I think that's the understanding</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/934-1
00:07:57.943 --> 00:07:58.993
<v Hou, Eric>and that's the policy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/941-0
00:07:58.993 --> 00:08:03.473
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'll be following it,
unfortunately otherwise otherwise.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/966-0
00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:09.677
<v Hou, Eric>The school will consider those two
classes the same, which is, I don't know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/966-1
00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:14.421
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly would choose bad for that,
but someone sent me some e-mail saying I</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/966-2
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.653
<v Hou, Eric>need to follow that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/989-0
00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:23.385
<v Teske, Benjamin>Is there a reason that there has to be
both homework and additional homework and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/989-1
00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:27.824
<v Teske, Benjamin>an exam like I've been in plenty of these
other grad classes that don't have final</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/989-2
00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:28.733
<v Teske, Benjamin>exams at the end.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/993-0
00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:30.803
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/996-0
00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:31.763
<v Hou, Eric>I hate bioexeem.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1005-0
00:08:31.763 --> 00:08:35.563
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can just basically consider
those are two additional homeworks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1016-0
00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:40.563
<v Hou, Eric>Ben, it's it won't be that challenging.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1018-0
00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:42.483
<v Hou, Eric>It won't be that stressful.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1034-0
00:08:44.013 --> 00:08:47.783
<v Hou, Eric>And you can open book, you can open codes.
You can do a lot of things.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1034-1
00:08:47.783 --> 00:08:50.013
<v Hou, Eric>He he shouldn't be bothering you too much.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1040-0
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:55.843
<v Hou, Eric>But why is there a final exam?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1045-0
00:08:58.073 --> 00:08:59.033
<v Hou, Eric>That's a good question.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1047-0
00:09:00.483 --> 00:09:00.803
<v Hou, Eric>I need to ask.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1058-0
00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.443
<v Hou, Eric>I I never heard about this policy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1068-0
00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:09.687
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm just being transparent and
telling you guys this is I'm planning to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1068-1
00:09:09.687 --> 00:09:09.883
<v Hou, Eric>do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1070-0
00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:12.063
<v Hou, Eric>But.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1072-0
00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:14.043
<v Hou, Eric>Someone said.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1093-0
00:09:16.003 --> 00:09:23.012
<v Hou, Eric>There has to be some substantial
differences between the grad student grad</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1093-1
00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:26.843
<v Hou, Eric>level class versus undergrad level class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1104-0
00:09:28.563 --> 00:09:32.963
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know how someone defines
substantial differences.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1106-0
00:09:38.403 --> 00:09:38.443
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1118-0
00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:43.306
<v Hou, Eric>I I think adding one short final and then
one assignment will be making it</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1118-1
00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:44.083
<v Hou, Eric>substantial.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1127-0
00:09:45.883 --> 00:09:47.483
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can just let it go.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1129-0
00:09:47.843 --> 00:09:48.843
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's my thought.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1147-0
00:09:55.593 --> 00:10:01.332
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely this is not something that you
know really helping you guys because that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1147-1
00:10:01.332 --> 00:10:04.953
<v Hou, Eric>means like you guys definitely gonna have
more work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1154-0
00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:10.383
<v Hou, Eric>Apologize for that because I I don't know
that policy either.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1160-0
00:10:11.913 --> 00:10:13.633
<v Hou, Eric>Should I know that policy?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1162-0
00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:14.753
<v Hou, Eric>I guess yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1170-0
00:10:17.063 --> 00:10:20.863
<v Hou, Eric>But maybe next time we can make it better
so then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1186-0
00:10:22.293 --> 00:10:27.092
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually issue this should grad
student do a little bit more on this I</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1186-1
00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:28.213
<v Hou, Eric>guess is also yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1189-0
00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:39.163
<v Hou, Eric>Any question?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1191-0
00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:43.763
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1197-0
00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:49.153
<v Hou, Eric>So so far this is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1205-0
00:10:49.393 --> 00:10:52.553
<v Hou, Eric>This is the homework and proposal results,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1221-0
00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:55.773
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
pretty good you guys view the pretty</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1221-1
00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:59.553
<v Hou, Eric>solid foundation and then we do have a
survey, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1236-0
00:10:59.553 --> 00:11:03.873
<v Hou, Eric>So then, here's a survey results.
I do have a sample size equal to 7.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1250-0
00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:10.784
<v Hou, Eric>Potentially those are result from seven
groups in terms of course rate out of</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1250-1
00:11:10.784 --> 00:11:13.353
<v Hou, Eric>five, the course rate is 3.9.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1256-0
00:11:14.183 --> 00:11:16.863
<v Hou, Eric>For the average and the median is 4.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1266-0
00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:20.933
<v Hou, Eric>And a standard deviation point I consider
this is not bad.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1305-0
00:11:22.823 --> 00:11:29.352
<v Hou, Eric>You know, follow my expectation.
So difficulty wise among those seven</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1305-1
00:11:29.352 --> 00:11:36.813
<v Hou, Eric>groups, the difficulty is 3 point 3.
6 and the median is 4 standard deviation .</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1305-2
00:11:36.813 --> 00:11:40.543
<v Hou, Eric>9 also. So it seems like the difficulty.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1311-0
00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:44.423
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of average, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1314-0
00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:45.303
<v Hou, Eric>So this is not high.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1317-0
00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:47.143
<v Hou, Eric>So which is not bad.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1341-0
00:11:48.813 --> 00:11:53.983
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know if that's 3.
6 only taking count of the materials with</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1341-1
00:11:53.983 --> 00:11:58.853
<v Hou, Eric>covered during the class or just the
homework because something.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1361-0
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:05.109
<v Hou, Eric>I couldn't connect is we're saying the
typical is 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1361-1
00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:09.823
<v Hou, Eric>6 out of five and the homework is close
to perfect?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1380-0
00:12:11.543 --> 00:12:18.783
<v Hou, Eric>Homework is definitely above 90,
so if I'm just reading from the numbers</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1380-1
00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:21.063
<v Hou, Eric>right, the homework is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1396-0
00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:29.703
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of relative score higher than 90
and then the rating of difficulty is 3.6.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1408-0
00:12:30.953 --> 00:12:35.101
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of average,
does that mean we do have a significant</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1408-1
00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:35.713
<v Hou, Eric>room for?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1414-0
00:12:37.143 --> 00:12:38.423
<v Hou, Eric>Guiding the homework more difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1418-0
00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.613
<v Hou, Eric>Just directly reading the numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1429-0
00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:48.018
<v Hou, Eric>That's how I read those numbers.
Is that the way how you guys read the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1429-1
00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:48.463
<v Hou, Eric>numbers?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1437-0
00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:59.013
<v Benbenek, MATT>I don't think the homework needs to get
more difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1442-0
00:13:00.473 --> 00:13:01.433
<v Benbenek, MATT>I think it's challenging.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1444-0
00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:03.223
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1447-0
00:13:06.183 --> 00:13:06.583
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1463-0
00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:13.293
<v Hou, Eric>So we we think that homework should be
kept as as was in terms of the difficulty.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1466-0
00:13:15.643 --> 00:13:16.243

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.693
<v Hou, Eric>That's managing that way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1476-0
00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:24.263
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1477-0
00:13:24.543 --> 00:13:24.983
<v Hou, Eric>That's fine.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1488-0
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:31.863

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:56.873
<v Hou, Eric>So I also asked the GPT for to give me
the weight where the weight is generated</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1540-1
00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:59.103

<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then the frequency of mentions,
have you mention similar things so many</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1561-1
00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:06.653
<v Hou, Eric>times or definitely consider those are?</v>

<v Hou, Eric>Definitely trying to build some strong
foundation in Aiml. That's the motivation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1833-0
00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:14.553
<v Hou, Eric>A medium emphasis so that we do have a
lot of lies and a code books.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1853-0

it's important to learning Python Python</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1871-1
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:32.873
<v Hou, Eric>projects.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1875-0
00:16:32.873 --> 00:16:34.393
<v Hou, Eric>Basically flexibility.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1898-0
00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:41.379
<v Hou, Eric>I I really do not like final exam if if
the university doesn't require me to do</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1898-1

00:16:47.043 --> 00:16:50.803
<v Hou, Eric>So those are pros,
so let's just focus on the cons, right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1916-0
00:16:53.323 --> 00:16:56.323
<v Hou, Eric>So then we I can't just explain each one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1922-0
00:16:57.753 --> 00:17:02.233
<v Hou, Eric>High emphasis,
heavy focus on coding stats.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1938-0
00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:08.523
<v Hou, Eric>Students want more AI applications and
case studies on business adoption.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1945-0

<v Hou, Eric>Yes, highly focus on coding stats.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1960-0
00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:22.803
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I I think I already explained
at the beginning of the class is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1982-0
00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:30.622
<v Hou, Eric>I do want you guys to have a taste of
those. The codes behind the scene,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1982-1
00:17:30.622 --> 00:17:34.313
<v Hou, Eric>how those,
how those results were generated.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/1988-0
00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:38.993
<v Hou, Eric>That was the purpose of the one of the
purpose of this class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2003-0
00:17:40.233 --> 00:17:47.273
<v Hou, Eric>I do need you guys to know the stats and
how you read those tables those results.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2005-0
00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:49.963
<v Hou, Eric>Because.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2023-0
00:17:51.723 --> 00:17:55.139
<v Hou, Eric>Even in the end,
you want to know a lot of AI applications</v>

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:16.523
<v Hou, Eric>You have to make the decisions based upon
numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2053-0
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.003

some department,</v>

00:18:24.184 --> 00:18:28.339
<v Hou, Eric>you will have to be numbers against the
numbers. You, you know,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2080-2
00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:32.363
<v Hou, Eric>you guys learn finance,
you guys learn the not present value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2115-0
00:18:33.163 --> 00:18:38.828
<v Hou, Eric>This is how you will be using how to go
or no go with your project right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2115-1
00:18:38.828 --> 00:18:45.258
<v Hou, Eric>So that you guys do the corporate finance
and then to to you know to to to evaluate</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2115-2

00:18:53.273 --> 00:18:58.633
<v Hou, Eric>In the in this current world,
my take of how business running is,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2137-1
00:18:58.633 --> 00:19:01.393
<v Hou, Eric>you know, numbers against numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2139-0
00:19:03.003 --> 00:19:03.123
<v Hou, Eric>You.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2174-0
00:19:04.803 --> 00:19:08.897
<v Hou, Eric>Show your numbers based upon your
assumptions compared to the other</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2174-1
00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:11.726
<v Hou, Eric>person's numbers based upon their
assumptions,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2174-2
00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:16.843
<v Hou, Eric>and then you have a you you have view the
foundation to have a further conversation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2181-0
00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:21.323
<v Hou, Eric>I do see this is getting more and more
utilized.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2195-0
00:19:24.283 --> 00:19:28.603
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why I do want you guys to
know the coding and stats.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2201-0
00:19:30.483 --> 00:19:33.243
<v Hou, Eric>But if the question is about.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2227-0
00:19:35.803 --> 00:19:40.603
<v Hou, Eric>Is about whether or not we should have a
lot of Python coding, and then you know,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2227-1
00:19:40.603 --> 00:19:45.285
<v Hou, Eric>in the finance the most important thing,
the most important tool we're actually</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2227-2
00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:46.163
<v Hou, Eric>using is Excel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2239-0
00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:52.043
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll do some Excel examples so that
you guys can learn how to use Excel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2246-0
00:19:52.553 --> 00:19:55.953
<v Hou, Eric>To to to build some models I will
definitely do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2250-0
00:19:57.353 --> 00:19:59.793
<v Hou, Eric>But Python coding is still going to be
there.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2271-0
00:20:01.713 --> 00:20:06.353
<v Hou, Eric>Lack of prior coding experience, making,
troubleshooting and understanding</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2271-1
00:20:06.353 --> 00:20:07.713
<v Hou, Eric>assignments difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2277-0
00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:13.553
<v Hou, Eric>I do acknowledge that this is definitely
one of the issues.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2290-0
00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:19.363
<v Hou, Eric>I do see if you do not have coding
experience before.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2294-0
00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:21.963
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2298-0
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:24.283
<v Hou, Eric>I do see that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2306-0
00:20:26.763 --> 00:20:29.723
<v Hou, Eric>Back to my MBA period of time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2314-0
00:20:31.403 --> 00:20:37.083
<v Hou, Eric>When when our professor offered, you know,
offered, you know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2330-0
00:20:38.763 --> 00:20:44.403
<v Hou, Eric>Machine learning and AI class at at Booth
I do know a lot of my my peers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2334-0
00:20:44.403 --> 00:20:46.043
<v Hou, Eric>They do not know how to code in.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2342-0
00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:47.953
<v Hou, Eric>Are how to call them Python?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2361-0
00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:54.815
<v Hou, Eric>They it's definitely an issue for them
and then back then that time there is no</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2361-1
00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:56.083
<v Hou, Eric>AI and there is no BT.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2375-0
00:20:56.643 --> 00:21:00.083
<v Hou, Eric>So then they can just ask and then ask
the chat GP to call for them.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2378-0
00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:01.643
<v Hou, Eric>So that's an issue.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2385-0
00:21:01.683 --> 00:21:05.523
<v Hou, Eric>That's a problem from what I can see in
my peers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2390-0
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.003
<v Hou, Eric>Went through that difficult time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2396-0
00:21:10.803 --> 00:21:13.243
<v Hou, Eric>They, they, they they survived.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2400-0
00:21:14.193 --> 00:21:15.713
<v Hou, Eric>They they definitely survived.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2422-0
00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:23.127
<v Hou, Eric>And and some of them are from Hashem,
some of them from big different companies,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2422-1
00:21:23.127 --> 00:21:25.523
<v Hou, Eric>consulting, managing, consulting.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2429-0
00:21:25.523 --> 00:21:29.323
<v Hou, Eric>They they don't have coding experience
they go through.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2434-0
00:21:30.963 --> 00:21:31.443
<v Hou, Eric>They were.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2438-0
00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:32.763
<v Hou, Eric>They're they're doing great.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2451-0
00:21:32.763 --> 00:21:41.123
<v Hou, Eric>So then the experience helped them to
eventually learn the job in big tax.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2457-0
00:21:42.763 --> 00:21:44.043
<v Hou, Eric>Some of them went to Google.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2461-0
00:21:44.043 --> 00:21:45.203
<v Hou, Eric>Some of them went to Amazon.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2469-0
00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:51.003
<v Hou, Eric>So then their feedback is this journey is
challenging is difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2474-0
00:21:51.433 --> 00:21:54.153
<v Hou, Eric>Do they like it?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2490-0
00:21:54.193 --> 00:21:58.829
<v Hou, Eric>They'll definitely say they like it,
but during the process they don't like it,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2490-1
00:21:58.829 --> 00:22:00.393
<v Hou, Eric>but they they went through.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2506-0
00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:07.837
<v Hou, Eric>So then I since I do have AII do value
Marquette University as a great</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2506-1
00:22:07.837 --> 00:22:08.953
<v Hou, Eric>university.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2512-0
00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.393
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm just using the same standard
here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2520-0
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:17.793
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know you will be facing a lot
of competition.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2523-0
00:22:18.483 --> 00:22:19.363
<v Hou, Eric>Out of school.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2535-0
00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:26.563
<v Hou, Eric>So then my philosophy is you the better
suffer in the school than out of school.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2574-0
00:22:27.423 --> 00:22:32.898
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then that's why, you know,
if you do feel prior, you know,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2574-1
00:22:32.898 --> 00:22:39.483
<v Hou, Eric>if you don't have coding experience is a
great opportunity to for you to pick that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2574-2
00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:45.355
<v Hou, Eric>up. Because if you go to your work,
if that you may need it and then it's</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2574-3
00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:46.703
<v Hou, Eric>it's better suff.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2577-0
00:22:46.903 --> 00:22:48.663
<v Hou, Eric>Now than later.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2588-0
00:22:49.833 --> 00:22:54.713
<v Hou, Eric>That's how I'm thinking of why design is
class now like this way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2617-0
00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:59.609
<v Hou, Eric>With that being said,
with that being said,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2617-1
00:22:59.609 --> 00:23:05.259
<v Hou, Eric>I did suggest that to the finance
department that maybe we should design</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2617-2
00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.283
<v Hou, Eric>some class right before this one to have
the folks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2622-0
00:23:11.953 --> 00:23:15.033
<v Hou, Eric>Start using some coding tools.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2630-0
00:23:16.523 --> 00:23:19.563
<v Hou, Eric>Learn some coding skills which going to
be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2637-0
00:23:21.363 --> 00:23:23.723
<v Hou, Eric>A fundamental skill for everyone.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2661-0
00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:32.655
<v Hou, Eric>The course content heavy,
making it challenging to digest all the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2661-1
00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:36.655
<v Hou, Eric>materials in one long lecture.
I totally agree with that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2661-2
00:23:36.655 --> 00:23:40.103
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think 3 hours class is really
helping us.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2664-0
00:23:41.643 --> 00:23:42.483
<v Hou, Eric>I don't like it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2697-0
00:23:44.163 --> 00:23:49.869
<v Hou, Eric>I think I I believe there is another
another suggestion to say saying the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2697-1
00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:54.188
<v Hou, Eric>similar thing right.
So then in the past case scenario,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2697-2
00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:56.963
<v Hou, Eric>this class should be split into two.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2703-0
00:23:56.963 --> 00:24:00.083
<v Hou, Eric>Each one could be like A1, an hour A1A,
half an hour.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2713-0
00:24:00.393 --> 00:24:03.113
<v Hou, Eric>Now be the best case scenario.
Three hours.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2715-0
00:24:03.513 --> 00:24:05.313
<v Hou, Eric>Oh man, this is really challenging.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2721-0
00:24:07.473 --> 00:24:08.713
<v Hou, Eric>I do agree with that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2734-0
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:12.984
<v Hou, Eric>This is some suggestion I'm gonna present
at the board meeting.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2734-1
00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:15.313
<v Hou, Eric>So then hopefully someone gonna change it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2741-0
00:24:16.633 --> 00:24:19.353
<v Hou, Eric>Coding errors can be frustrating all the
time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2743-0
00:24:20.843 --> 00:24:21.363
<v Hou, Eric>All the time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2751-0
00:24:23.443 --> 00:24:25.403
<v Hou, Eric>Luckily, luckily you guys have the AI.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2768-0
00:24:27.563 --> 00:24:32.883
<v Hou, Eric>When I was was undergrad,
my my undergrad was computational math.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2772-0
00:24:32.963 --> 00:24:35.803
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I learned A/C plus plus before.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2780-0
00:24:37.683 --> 00:24:39.723
<v Hou, Eric>Fortran, Java, Python, R.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2788-0
00:24:39.723 --> 00:24:46.043
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the programming language I
learned without AI, especially C.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2794-0
00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:49.633
<v Hou, Eric>You know you don't.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2798-0
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.873
<v Hou, Eric>You miss a semi column.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2811-0
00:24:50.873 --> 00:24:55.953
<v Hou, Eric>It won't run through and then you have to
spend hours. So to debug the errors.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2827-0
00:24:55.993 --> 00:24:58.780
<v Hou, Eric>Totally error coding errors can be
frustrating,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2827-1
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.553
<v Hou, Eric>especially without enough guidance or
troubleshooting resources.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2832-0
00:25:03.963 --> 00:25:05.163
<v Hou, Eric>I totally agree with you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2845-0
00:25:06.953 --> 00:25:13.273
<v Hou, Eric>If you do face any issue troubleshooting
those codes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2864-0
00:25:14.393 --> 00:25:21.043
<v Hou, Eric>The better suggestion is copy your code
and copy your error message to and and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2864-1
00:25:21.043 --> 00:25:24.073
<v Hou, Eric>paste in ChatGPT in the same prompt.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2868-0
00:25:24.993 --> 00:25:26.073
<v Hou, Eric>And help.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2876-0
00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:29.673
<v Hou, Eric>I ask GPD help you to decode debug.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2878-0
00:25:30.473 --> 00:25:31.673
<v Hou, Eric>Usually it's.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2891-0
00:25:33.523 --> 00:25:37.803
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's more in the future and for you
to just take a look at all the calls.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2928-0
00:25:39.633 --> 00:25:46.188
<v Hou, Eric>And and do use AI is definitely boost the
efficiency by at least 10 times. Uh.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2928-1
00:25:46.188 --> 00:25:51.331
<v Hou, Eric>But with that being said,
I understand you guys are using AI.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2928-2
00:25:51.331 --> 00:25:55.977
<v Hou, Eric>Understand you you using AI to solve a
lot of problems.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2928-3
00:25:55.977 --> 00:25:59.793
<v Hou, Eric>Try to split your problem into several
steps.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2934-0
00:26:01.073 --> 00:26:03.393
<v Hou, Eric>And solve the problem in each step.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2960-0
00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:10.853
<v Hou, Eric>Umm a general suggestion not to ask the
AI to solve a huge problem because the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2960-1
00:26:10.853 --> 00:26:15.443
<v Hou, Eric>the time you debug,
even with AI gonna be really really long.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2971-0
00:26:15.563 --> 00:26:19.203
<v Hou, Eric>I try to use AI to call the app for me.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2989-0
00:26:19.723 --> 00:26:24.844
<v Hou, Eric>Oh man, yes, in, in,
in one minute or two you will have pretty</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/2989-1
00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:29.883
<v Hou, Eric>much 90% of the calls ready for you for
the next three hours.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3005-0
00:26:30.273 --> 00:26:34.505
<v Hou, Eric>You just want to make sure every single
piece of the function will run inside</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3005-1
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:34.993
<v Hou, Eric>that app.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3009-0
00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:37.073
<v Hou, Eric>So it is challenging.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3011-0
00:26:37.073 --> 00:26:38.433
<v Hou, Eric>It is frustrating.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3023-0
00:26:40.113 --> 00:26:45.033
<v Hou, Eric>But you know when you code,
you have to do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3033-0
00:26:45.233 --> 00:26:47.993
<v Hou, Eric>But at least you have all the logic in
front of you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3061-0
00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.824
<v Hou, Eric>That's much better than Excel because you
have those numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3061-1
00:26:51.824 --> 00:26:56.300
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot guarantee those numbers are
correctly calculated because those</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3061-2
00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.473
<v Hou, Eric>formula are are are hidden unless you
Click to show you the formula.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3063-0
00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:01.833
<v Hou, Eric>But usually people do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3074-0
00:27:03.553 --> 00:27:10.873
<v Hou, Eric>So take away.
I will give you guys more Excel examples.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3081-0
00:27:13.353 --> 00:27:16.153
<v Hou, Eric>It is challenging,
so hopefully in the future.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3095-0
00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:20.977
<v Hou, Eric>We we can,
we can redesign this class in a better</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3095-1
00:27:20.977 --> 00:27:21.243
<v Hou, Eric>way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3100-0
00:27:21.243 --> 00:27:23.283
<v Hou, Eric>So then one and half an hour per class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3115-0
00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:28.564
<v Hou, Eric>Unfortunately,
coding debugging is frustrating and I,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3115-1
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:31.003
<v Hou, Eric>you know, utilizing AI can help that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3142-0
00:27:33.553 --> 00:27:38.838
<v Hou, Eric>And I do hope you guys can can
successfully go through this difficulty</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3142-1
00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:44.793
<v Hou, Eric>difficult and challenging pro class when
you do not have the coding experience.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3157-0
00:27:45.273 --> 00:27:50.388
<v Hou, Eric>Believe me,
if you just if you can handle this in the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3157-1
00:27:50.388 --> 00:27:53.513
<v Hou, Eric>end, you survive from your class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3168-0
00:27:54.193 --> 00:27:59.073
<v Hou, Eric>You the the way how you look at yourself.
You you know there's nothing you cannot.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3181-0
00:27:59.313 --> 00:28:04.951
<v Hou, Eric>There's nothing can block you and and and
you can start coding for something really</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3181-1
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:05.353
<v Hou, Eric>big K.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3192-0
00:28:06.883 --> 00:28:10.923
<v Hou, Eric>Medium emphasis student without a
business or finance background.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3205-0
00:28:10.923 --> 00:28:14.893
<v Hou, Eric>Find a finance aspect difficult to follow
and would benefit from over you before</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3205-1
00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:16.363
<v Hou, Eric>diving into technical content.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3210-0
00:28:18.933 --> 00:28:23.053
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, that is true as always.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3219-0
00:28:24.483 --> 00:28:25.683
<v Hou, Eric>And then that's the motivation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3261-0
00:28:25.683 --> 00:28:30.707
<v Hou, Eric>Why I I took it in my MBA because I'm
100% technical background.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3261-1
00:28:30.707 --> 00:28:35.808
<v Hou, Eric>I do not have any of well,
I sort of have some finance background</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3261-2
00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:42.223
<v Hou, Eric>just because what I'm learning is for my
pH. D is is totally related with finance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3261-3
00:28:42.223 --> 00:28:43.923
<v Hou, Eric>But I learned all the.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3265-0
00:28:43.923 --> 00:28:44.923
<v Hou, Eric>Finance aspects myself.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3267-0
00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:48.753
<v Hou, Eric>Is hard.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3280-0
00:28:50.683 --> 00:28:56.403
<v Hou, Eric>Because when I when I sort of took this
challenge to this class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3294-0
00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:02.963
<v Hou, Eric>The finance department told me that you
guys should have the finance background.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3322-0
00:29:04.803 --> 00:29:10.474
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know why why I received this
this comments so I will need to circle</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3322-1
00:29:10.474 --> 00:29:15.923
<v Hou, Eric>back to to finance department and then we
need to add some prerequisites.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3324-0
00:29:16.393 --> 00:29:17.433
<v Hou, Eric>For for this class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3330-0
00:29:19.853 --> 00:29:21.653
<v Hou, Eric>A steep learning curve in math.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3343-0
00:29:21.653 --> 00:29:27.653
<v Hou, Eric>Make it difficult to validate models even
if coding logic is understood OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3345-0
00:29:29.553 --> 00:29:30.473
<v Hou, Eric>Comment on that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3347-0
00:29:33.153 --> 00:29:33.273
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3362-0
00:29:36.463 --> 00:29:40.543
<v Hou, Eric>The coding logic is understood,
however it's it's hard.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3372-0
00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:47.063
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's, it's it's kind of the math,
looks like it's a blocker.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3377-0
00:29:48.523 --> 00:29:49.483
<v Hou, Eric>I I kind of agree with you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3382-0
00:29:51.403 --> 00:29:53.443
<v Hou, Eric>However, with that being said.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3396-0
00:29:56.473 --> 00:30:02.248
<v Hou, Eric>Will have to do.
Will have to use more math when we are</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3396-1
00:30:02.248 --> 00:30:05.753
<v Hou, Eric>talking about the neural networks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3399-0
00:30:07.283 --> 00:30:07.683
<v Hou, Eric>The reason?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3418-0
00:30:09.683 --> 00:30:17.214
<v Hou, Eric>I move this class so fast we pretty much
cover all the existing classic models</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3418-1
00:30:17.214 --> 00:30:18.643
<v Hou, Eric>before midterm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3427-0
00:30:20.723 --> 00:30:25.443
<v Hou, Eric>Is I want to cover neural network
transformer and large Lancet models.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3454-0
00:30:26.313 --> 00:30:31.253
<v Hou, Eric>In the second-half of of this class,
because I sort of believe that you guys</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3454-1
00:30:31.253 --> 00:30:35.615
<v Hou, Eric>choose register for this class,
not because of those tree models or</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3454-2
00:30:35.615 --> 00:30:36.833
<v Hou, Eric>linear regressions.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3457-0
00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:38.443
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3472-0
00:30:38.443 --> 00:30:42.416
<v Hou, Eric>I I kind of believe that you guys choose
these class because you want to know more</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3472-1
00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:43.803
<v Hou, Eric>of the large language models.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3497-0
00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:51.457
<v Hou, Eric>And I really do not want to have this
class to be those large language model</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3497-1
00:30:51.457 --> 00:30:56.741
<v Hou, Eric>class to teach you guys how to use
ChatGPT and how do you guys how to teach</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3497-2
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:57.783
<v Hou, Eric>you guys write.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3502-0
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:00.713
<v Hou, Eric>Good or bad? Prompt.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3511-0
00:31:02.203 --> 00:31:04.363
<v Hou, Eric>Like Pure experiment class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3512-0
00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:05.763
<v Hou, Eric>Like what?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3527-0
00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:13.178
<v Hou, Eric>I said I want you guys to learn why large
language models are so bad dealing with</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3527-1
00:31:13.178 --> 00:31:14.443
<v Hou, Eric>those numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3531-0
00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:16.403
<v Hou, Eric>There is a reason behind Dean.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3551-0
00:31:17.593 --> 00:31:25.352
<v Hou, Eric>But you know, when we when human evolve,
the tools that human human beings decide</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3551-1
00:31:25.352 --> 00:31:27.433
<v Hou, Eric>to use in mathematics.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3580-0
00:31:30.163 --> 00:31:35.563
<v Hou, Eric>It's the mathematics of getting
definitely getting more and more complex</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3580-1
00:31:35.563 --> 00:31:40.741
<v Hou, Eric>when we move from linear regression to
tree models to neural network,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3580-2
00:31:40.741 --> 00:31:43.403
<v Hou, Eric>and we're gonna touch base on today.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3590-0
00:31:45.763 --> 00:31:49.763
<v Hou, Eric>I will make small examples to make the
math easy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3595-0
00:31:49.763 --> 00:31:53.123
<v Hou, Eric>Easier for you, but it has to be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3601-0
00:31:54.643 --> 00:31:56.163
<v Hou, Eric>It's really relatively easier.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3622-0
00:31:57.803 --> 00:32:02.026
<v Hou, Eric>Because when we talk about neural network,
it's a it's a black box.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3622-1
00:32:02.026 --> 00:32:06.683
<v Hou, Eric>When we talk about deep learning,
it's getting black box even even darker.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3645-0
00:32:08.403 --> 00:32:11.721
<v Hou, Eric>Not a lot of people really know like
what's going on over there,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3645-1
00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:15.395
<v Hou, Eric>so you can sort of have a math
understanding of what's going on and you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3645-2
00:32:15.395 --> 00:32:17.283
<v Hou, Eric>understand algorithm, you understand.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3674-0
00:32:17.553 --> 00:32:22.449
<v Hou, Eric>Idea how you train a model,
but if you say later on, right,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3674-1
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:28.733
<v Hou, Eric>so then you have a math formula for you
to see like what we are seeing those</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3674-2
00:32:28.733 --> 00:32:29.793
<v Hou, Eric>three models.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3679-0
00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:32.313
<v Hou, Eric>Hey. Hey,
it's bigger than some number we go.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3683-0
00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:33.953
<v Hou, Eric>We go left hand side.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3690-0
00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:36.353
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise we go right hand side.
Those kind of structure.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3699-0
00:32:37.883 --> 00:32:41.891
<v Hou, Eric>You you,
you start losing that clarity going</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3699-1
00:32:41.891 --> 00:32:42.603
<v Hou, Eric>forward.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3705-0
00:32:44.243 --> 00:32:46.723
<v Hou, Eric>And and you want to know why?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3708-0
00:32:48.403 --> 00:32:49.043
<v Hou, Eric>I said.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3715-0
00:32:49.043 --> 00:32:51.123
<v Hou, Eric>The temperature equal to 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3719-0
00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:54.083
<v Hou, Eric>I send the same question to that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3731-0
00:32:55.843 --> 00:33:00.763
<v Hou, Eric>Oom by why do I still have two different
results?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3739-0
00:33:01.873 --> 00:33:04.193
<v Hou, Eric>Suppose the temperature equals to 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3750-0
00:33:04.193 --> 00:33:08.153
<v Hou, Eric>You should have a static result,
however you still have dynamic result.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3752-0
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.113
<v Hou, Eric>Why is that?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3759-0
00:33:10.353 --> 00:33:13.033
<v Hou, Eric>You you can know the idea.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3778-0
00:33:13.103 --> 00:33:18.019
<v Hou, Eric>You can know the reason,
but you wouldn't expect like there is</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3778-1
00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:20.983
<v Hou, Eric>randomness. All the place from now on.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3791-0
00:33:21.143 --> 00:33:26.620
<v Hou, Eric>So then the math is going to be more and
more difficult.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3791-1
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.943
<v Hou, Eric>And what I can do is give you more
examples.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3794-0
00:33:32.463 --> 00:33:34.583
<v Hou, Eric>Make it more transparent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3809-0
00:33:35.363 --> 00:33:41.763
<v Hou, Eric>So then you guys can have seen I have a
view of why those models work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3816-0
00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:46.073
<v Hou, Eric>But it is impossible.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3824-0
00:33:47.383 --> 00:33:51.463
<v Hou, Eric>To make math easier from now, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3842-0
00:33:52.953 --> 00:33:57.353
<v Hou, Eric>So lack of graded feedback on assignment
make it harder to judge expectations.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3846-0
00:33:57.713 --> 00:33:58.633
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry about that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3861-0
00:33:58.633 --> 00:34:01.290
<v Hou, Eric>I really didn't have time to create your
homework,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3861-1
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.353
<v Hou, Eric>and thanks to the the spring break I I
finished all the grading kind of work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3871-0
00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:10.273
<v Hou, Eric>But from now on I will try my best to
grade their homework on time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3892-0
00:34:12.983 --> 00:34:16.912
<v Hou, Eric>Online format,
a long lecture duration make focus and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3892-1
00:34:16.912 --> 00:34:20.696
<v Hou, Eric>retention difficult,
though recorded lectures help.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3892-2
00:34:20.696 --> 00:34:22.223
<v Hou, Eric>I do agree with that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3896-0
00:34:24.313 --> 00:34:24.353
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3909-0
00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:31.993
<v Hou, Eric>I made a number of recommendation to
change to change this course in person.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3916-0
00:34:33.633 --> 00:34:35.033
<v Hou, Eric>I I never was.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3926-0
00:34:35.113 --> 00:34:40.873
<v Hou, Eric>I never was a fan,
not even a biggest fan of online class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3928-0
00:34:40.873 --> 00:34:41.793
<v Hou, Eric>Not at all.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3931-0
00:34:43.013 --> 00:34:45.133
<v Hou, Eric>But my original.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3939-0
00:34:46.143 --> 00:34:48.063
<v Hou, Eric>Ask was to record his class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3949-0
00:34:48.063 --> 00:34:51.863
<v Hou, Eric>Not even, you know,
talk to you guys in real time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3955-0
00:34:52.343 --> 00:34:54.263
<v Hou, Eric>I I don't like that idea.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3958-0
00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:54.623
<v Hou, Eric>I push it back.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3962-0
00:34:54.623 --> 00:34:56.743
<v Hou, Eric>I think at least I need to talk to you
guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3970-0
00:34:58.593 --> 00:35:00.793
<v Hou, Eric>And then the department stopped it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3976-0
00:35:00.793 --> 00:35:02.913
<v Hou, Eric>And then that's why we have the current
format.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3994-0
00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:10.403
<v Hou, Eric>And I was even pushing the the in person
class and then they they're saying that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/3994-1
00:35:10.403 --> 00:35:12.393
<v Hou, Eric>let's just do online first.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4019-0
00:35:13.783 --> 00:35:19.851
<v Hou, Eric>And then that's why for one of the
speaker that gonna doing his presentation</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4019-1
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:24.263
<v Hou, Eric>on March the 31st,
I push my bass to make it in person.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4033-0
00:35:25.713 --> 00:35:28.113
<v Hou, Eric>So then at least we can have one class in
person.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4041-0
00:35:28.113 --> 00:35:31.153
<v Hou, Eric>At least I can see you guys and know you
guys right now.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4044-0
00:35:31.153 --> 00:35:32.313
<v Hou, Eric>You guys can only see me.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4049-0
00:35:32.313 --> 00:35:33.273
<v Hou, Eric>I don't see you guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4051-0
00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:36.593
<v Hou, Eric>So we just kind of interesting class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4071-0
00:35:38.783 --> 00:35:44.303
<v Hou, Eric>Grad students prefer a biweekly meeting
format instead of weekly 3 hour sessions.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4089-0
00:35:44.303 --> 00:35:47.663
<v Hou, Eric>I totally agree with you guys,
not only grass students,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4089-1
00:35:47.663 --> 00:35:49.943
<v Hou, Eric>but undergrad students also want that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4105-0
00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:53.061
<v Hou, Eric>Everyone wants that,
so this is one suggestion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4105-1
00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:57.023
<v Hou, Eric>I need to make in a board meeting to the
Finance department.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4120-0
00:35:58.403 --> 00:36:04.577
<v Hou, Eric>A more fundamental approach to teaching
coding before applying financial models</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4120-1
00:36:04.577 --> 00:36:06.043
<v Hou, Eric>will be beneficial.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4123-0
00:36:06.443 --> 00:36:07.603
<v Hou, Eric>I agree with you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4139-0
00:36:07.923 --> 00:36:12.574
<v Hou, Eric>So then from next time,
we should have some prerequisite of this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4139-1
00:36:12.574 --> 00:36:13.003
<v Hou, Eric>class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4145-0
00:36:13.003 --> 00:36:16.283
<v Hou, Eric>So then at least the students should have
some coding skills.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4148-0
00:36:17.713 --> 00:36:18.313
<v Hou, Eric>Addition.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4166-0
00:36:20.193 --> 00:36:23.993
<v Hou, Eric>Or guide and walk through will help.
Is coding experience exercises OK?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4182-0
00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:31.827

00:36:56.113 --> 00:37:00.645
<v Hou, Eric>I guess if we do need more walkthroughs
to help with coding,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4247-1

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4682-0
00:41:34.343 --> 00:41:37.583
<v Hou, Eric>So then in terms of questions you wanna
ask?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4688-0
00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:41.643
<v Hou, Eric>So then in terms of in terms of?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4704-0
00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:50.623
<v Hou, Eric>Interactions that you wanna do that do,
but do send me what you want to hear.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4713-0
00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:53.663
<v Hou, Eric>And I I do receive some really good
feedback, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4726-0
00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:56.372
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
for example in in Nadia's presentation,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4726-1
00:41:56.372 --> 00:41:58.583
<v Hou, Eric>you guys mentioned that maybe we should.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4729-0
00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:00.183
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe she should have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4742-0
00:42:00.303 --> 00:42:05.863
<v Hou, Eric>She should have send a video before the
hand so you guys can watch it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4754-0
00:42:05.863 --> 00:42:08.098
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
I I I think that's a perfect suggestion,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4754-1
00:42:08.098 --> 00:42:08.383
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4770-0
00:42:08.383 --> 00:42:15.023
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will do the same to to ask the
the future speakers to have them prepared.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4778-0
00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:19.223
<v Hou, Eric>Anything you guys want me to do,
I'll definitely transfer.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4788-0
00:42:19.993 --> 00:42:23.753
<v Hou, Eric>But I also want you guys to be prepared
in those presentations.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4796-0
00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:27.943
<v Hou, Eric>Because in terms of questions,
uh or or feedback, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4798-0
00:42:27.943 --> 00:42:28.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then yeah.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4814-0
00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:34.073
<v Hou, Eric>Offer more structured content with a
clear, uh, real world example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4817-0
00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:36.033
<v Hou, Eric>So enhance comprehension, OK?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4818-0
00:42:36.033 --> 00:42:36.993
<v Hou, Eric>I'll try to do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4824-0
00:42:38.713 --> 00:42:40.553
<v Hou, Eric>Include detail step by step video.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4838-0
00:42:42.153 --> 00:42:46.018
<v Hou, Eric>Tutorials and a guide to walk through for
coding assignments,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4838-1
00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:47.513
<v Hou, Eric>including common errors.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4841-0
00:42:49.783 --> 00:42:51.983
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, I'll try but.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4866-0
00:42:53.473 --> 00:42:57.394
<v Hou, Eric>I'll also ask you guys to come to my
office hours.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4866-1
00:42:57.394 --> 00:43:03.313
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the time dedicated for guided
walk through for coding assignments.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4873-0
00:43:05.113 --> 00:43:08.353
<v Hou, Eric>Style by step video tutorials.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4878-0
00:43:10.063 --> 00:43:12.263
<v Hou, Eric>I will have to say no.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4884-0
00:43:14.263 --> 00:43:17.423
<v Hou, Eric>Detailed step by step videos.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4887-0
00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:22.953
<v Hou, Eric>That's very tricky.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4891-0
00:43:24.543 --> 00:43:25.103
<v Hou, Eric>I will not do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4898-0
00:43:30.463 --> 00:43:32.623
<v Hou, Eric>Just because I really do not have time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4906-0
00:43:34.103 --> 00:43:38.823
<v Hou, Eric>So then you come to my office hour.
You post questions.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4914-0
00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:44.303
<v Hou, Eric>That's the two channels you can have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4925-0
00:43:45.903 --> 00:43:47.743
<v Hou, Eric>Step by step guided walkthroughs.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4934-0
00:43:48.143 --> 00:43:54.072
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise,
I assume you guys can handle it yourself,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4934-1
00:43:54.072 --> 00:43:54.743
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4940-0
00:43:55.183 --> 00:43:59.583
<v Hou, Eric>And because I do have the channel
designed for that purpose.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4942-0
00:44:00.093 --> 00:44:00.213
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4956-0
00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:05.293
<v Hou, Eric>And so far I don't think you. No one.
I don't think anyone's using that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4964-0
00:44:06.213 --> 00:44:10.053
<v Hou, Eric>And then why do I provide more help if
you guys can do it?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4982-0
00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:18.262
<v Hou, Eric>Shift to a two day a week in person
lecture format for better engagement and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4982-1
00:44:18.262 --> 00:44:19.203
<v Hou, Eric>the retention.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4984-0
00:44:20.243 --> 00:44:21.363
<v Hou, Eric>I do agree with you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4989-0
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:24.583
<v Hou, Eric>I do agree with you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/4995-0
00:44:25.383 --> 00:44:29.503
<v Hou, Eric>So then we will make the change for in
the future.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5013-0
00:44:31.143 --> 00:44:36.579
<v Hou, Eric>Balance AI application with math and
coding by dictating one lecture to each</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5013-1
00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:37.143
<v Hou, Eric>aspects.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5015-0
00:44:40.013 --> 00:44:40.173
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5022-0
00:44:44.193 --> 00:44:47.593
<v Hou, Eric>Dedicated volunteerver each aspect. So OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5027-0
00:44:49.423 --> 00:44:49.903
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5033-0
00:44:49.903 --> 00:44:54.023
<v Hou, Eric>So my understanding is we want to have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5036-0
00:44:56.823 --> 00:44:57.703
<v Hou, Eric>Math and coding.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5049-0
00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:07.043
<v Hou, Eric>That was a math and coding by dedicating
1 lecture.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5052-0
00:45:08.503 --> 00:45:09.143
<v Hou, Eric>To each aspect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5078-0
00:45:14.143 --> 00:45:20.568
<v Hou, Eric>Does it mean that we need to balance math
and coding 50 / 50 in one lecture or you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5078-1
00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:24.903
<v Hou, Eric>want one lecture with math and one
lecture with coding?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5087-0
00:45:31.393 --> 00:45:33.873
<v Hou, Eric>But I mean I can do either either way,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5094-0
00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:36.153
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can do more math.
I can do more coding.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5098-0
00:45:37.623 --> 00:45:38.903
<v Hou, Eric>And that's totally fine with me.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5107-0
00:45:40.543 --> 00:45:43.343
<v Hou, Eric>Take more time to explain code in detail
during class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5112-0
00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:45.623
<v Hou, Eric>I will try.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5122-0
00:45:46.183 --> 00:45:51.041
<v Hou, Eric>Like all I said,
it'll be better solution to come to the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5122-1
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.063
<v Hou, Eric>office hour.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5136-0
00:45:53.613 --> 00:45:58.899
<v Hou, Eric>Introduce more structure discussion posts
where students analyze and discuss in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5136-1
00:45:58.899 --> 00:45:59.493
<v Hou, Eric>business.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5146-0
00:46:04.193 --> 00:46:08.393
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I'll I'll do some more posts on teams.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5166-0
00:46:09.903 --> 00:46:13.436
<v Hou, Eric>I'll I'll do some try,
provide additional sources,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5166-1
00:46:13.436 --> 00:46:18.632
<v Hou, Eric>like recommending GitHub accounts,
research papers and reading for further</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5166-2
00:46:18.632 --> 00:46:19.463
<v Hou, Eric>exploration.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5168-0
00:46:21.223 --> 00:46:21.463
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5175-0
00:46:24.243 --> 00:46:26.563
<v Hou, Eric>I will try to do more papers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5189-0
00:46:27.733 --> 00:46:33.573
<v Hou, Eric>Improve the D2L page with more examples
and readings on accomplishing tasks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5193-0
00:46:35.643 --> 00:46:36.083
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5201-0
00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:39.203
<v Hou, Eric>So I guess this is similar to providing
more content.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5211-0
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:44.383
<v Hou, Eric>Introduce smaller and more frequent
assignments, building knowledge.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5213-0
00:46:52.833 --> 00:46:53.193
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5224-0
00:46:54.663 --> 00:46:58.031
<v Hou, Eric>Add in class.
Follow along assignments are increase</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5224-1
00:46:58.031 --> 00:46:58.743
<v Hou, Eric>engagement.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5236-0
00:47:00.423 --> 00:47:05.143
<v Hou, Eric>The way I wanna increase engagement is I
wanna cancel this online class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5239-0
00:47:07.303 --> 00:47:07.343
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5246-0
00:47:07.343 --> 00:47:10.263
<v Hou, Eric>I I want to move the entire class to be
in person.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5257-0
00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:15.703
<v Hou, Eric>Like the the work in office kind of
movement.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5262-0
00:47:16.183 --> 00:47:19.423
<v Hou, Eric>No one should be working from home,
in my opinion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5269-0
00:47:21.243 --> 00:47:24.403
<v Hou, Eric>I really do not like that idea I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5283-0
00:47:26.183 --> 00:47:30.411
<v Hou, Eric>Really hope that you know we can move
away from that working,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5283-1
00:47:30.411 --> 00:47:32.183
<v Hou, Eric>working from home culture.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5294-0
00:47:33.823 --> 00:47:37.647
<v Hou, Eric>To move everyone back to the office,
that's my opinion in person.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5294-1
00:47:37.647 --> 00:47:38.863
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely add value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5304-0
00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:43.697
<v Hou, Eric>And then yes,
I totally agree with whoever made that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5304-1
00:47:43.697 --> 00:47:44.343
<v Hou, Eric>suggestion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5313-0
00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:49.333
<v Hou, Eric>In class it will be 100%.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5322-0
00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:54.293
<v Hou, Eric>In class it'll be 100% in person,
office hour, no.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5332-0
00:47:54.293 --> 00:47:59.940
<v Hou, Eric>Working from home, no remote class.
I I'm totally aligned with that</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5332-1
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.853
<v Hou, Eric>suggestion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5342-0
00:48:03.383 --> 00:48:06.623
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I think those are the feedbacks.
Any questions?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5357-0
00:48:34.923 --> 00:48:39.163
<v Mertens, Aidric>I agree with you Professor on having this
class in person as well.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5364-0
00:48:39.163 --> 00:48:40.963
<v Mertens, Aidric>Think it be beneficial for us all.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5363-0
00:48:39.373 --> 00:48:39.853
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5369-0
00:48:43.463 --> 00:48:45.743
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, I totally agree with that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5398-0
00:48:47.263 --> 00:48:50.359
<v Hou, Eric>And also I if I may make a suggestion
right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5398-1
00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:54.763
<v Hou, Eric>So then like when I made the same
suggestion several weeks ago,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5398-2
00:48:54.763 --> 00:48:57.583
<v Hou, Eric>maybe you guys wanna turn on your camera.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5410-0
00:48:57.783 --> 00:49:02.223
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's just a mimic code and call
like in person kind of environment.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5413-0
00:49:04.453 --> 00:49:05.693
<v Hou, Eric>But it's really up to you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5431-0
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:17.174
<v Hou, Eric>Because from my perspective, you know,
teaching, teaching a class,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5431-1
00:49:17.174 --> 00:49:20.153
<v Hou, Eric>you know everyone is turned off their
camera.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5434-0
00:49:20.153 --> 00:49:22.993
<v Hou, Eric>I'm only the person talking.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5436-0
00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:24.013
<v Hou, Eric>Uh.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5441-0
00:49:25.693 --> 00:49:27.853
<v Hou, Eric>Is really challenging for myself.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5443-0
00:49:36.413 --> 00:49:36.893
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5448-0
00:49:38.553 --> 00:49:41.113
<v Hou, Eric>So the take away is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5460-0
00:49:44.383 --> 00:49:48.543
<v Hou, Eric>We gonna cover more examples and then we
gonna do more Excel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5464-0
00:49:51.853 --> 00:49:53.093
<v Hou, Eric>We gonna do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5477-0
00:49:55.143 --> 00:49:58.303
<v Hou, Eric>We still have to do some coding and then
we have to do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5485-0
00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:03.103
<v Hou, Eric>A lot math,
because unfortunately that's the reality.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5495-0
00:50:04.743 --> 00:50:11.103
<v Hou, Eric>And then in class in person kind of
engagement.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5506-0
00:50:13.303 --> 00:50:16.063
<v Hou, Eric>Is really hard for this semester.
Unfortunately for you guys.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5515-0
00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:19.503
<v Hou, Eric>So that's changed that I do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5518-0
00:50:19.503 --> 00:50:20.703
<v Hou, Eric>Why you your feedback?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5535-0
00:50:21.513 --> 00:50:25.704
<v Hou, Eric>And this is this is super valuable for
the finance department.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5535-1
00:50:25.704 --> 00:50:27.633
<v Hou, Eric>I can finally tell them that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5541-0
00:50:29.063 --> 00:50:30.583
<v Hou, Eric>For future class, don't make.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5550-0
00:50:32.383 --> 00:50:37.063
<v Hou, Eric>This class, at least this class online.
It's not helping.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5562-0
00:50:40.693 --> 00:50:46.653
<v Hou, Eric>And I will try to make the home future
homework the same difficulty.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5564-0
00:50:48.783 --> 00:50:49.383
<v Hou, Eric>But.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5576-0
00:50:51.343 --> 00:50:54.743
<v Hou, Eric>I will have to manage with that being
said, I'll have to manage that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5590-0
00:50:58.063 --> 00:51:03.258
<v Hou, Eric>At least the score will be not like
everyone got a perfect score.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5590-1
00:51:03.258 --> 00:51:05.383
<v Hou, Eric>That's not going to happen.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5602-0
00:51:06.113 --> 00:51:09.993
<v Hou, Eric>OK, that everyone got a perfect score.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5605-0
00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:13.153
<v Hou, Eric>Home mortgages too easy in my opinion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5610-0
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:14.553
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have to address that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5618-0
00:51:15.153 --> 00:51:17.113
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will track the average.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5633-0
00:51:17.113 --> 00:51:23.161
<v Hou, Eric>So hopefully our average will be 5.
5 some for almost all homework,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5633-1
00:51:23.161 --> 00:51:26.273
<v Hou, Eric>so that would be pretty good to me.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5646-0
00:51:28.223 --> 00:51:32.823
<v Hou, Eric>And then also for the grad students,
I need to clarify the definition.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5652-0
00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:36.303
<v Hou, Eric>And I'll let you let you guys know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5668-0
00:51:37.613 --> 00:51:43.320
<v Hou, Eric>What I mean by additional homework and
additional final exam,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5668-1
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.173
<v Hou, Eric>so to help you guys prepare OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5672-0
00:51:49.043 --> 00:51:50.603
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you for.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5686-0
00:51:53.263 --> 00:51:57.103
<v Hou, Eric>Taking this class and then thank you for
providing a survey.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5690-0
00:51:57.423 --> 00:52:00.943
<v Hou, Eric>I think those are really valuable
feedback, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5709-0
00:52:04.373 --> 00:52:13.373
<v Hou, Eric>And to utilize the the office hour on
Tuesdays and and Thursdays, right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5732-0
00:52:13.373 --> 00:52:19.138
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's I do see for a lot of
feedback that you guys need help and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5732-1
00:52:19.138 --> 00:52:25.213
<v Hou, Eric>there's a way of there's a way that I can
help you and do utilize those ways.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5736-0
00:52:28.383 --> 00:52:31.863
<v Hou, Eric>OK, last round any questions?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5738-0
00:52:39.003 --> 00:52:39.563
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5747-0
00:52:41.783 --> 00:52:43.743
<v Hou, Eric>I'll close this one, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5749-0
00:52:43.743 --> 00:52:45.063
<v Hou, Eric>So that's just finish.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5752-0
00:52:49.863 --> 00:52:50.903
<v Hou, Eric>OK, that's.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5768-0
00:52:59.683 --> 00:53:02.539
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
I think before the spring break we talked</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5768-1
00:53:02.539 --> 00:53:05.083
<v Hou, Eric>about the support vector machines, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5772-0
00:53:05.083 --> 00:53:07.243
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's just quickly finish that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5782-0
00:53:08.043 --> 00:53:11.083
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can move to the neural network,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5785-0
00:53:11.083 --> 00:53:14.323
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a one the last.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5798-0
00:53:15.823 --> 00:53:20.623
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of classic models that we are
covering, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5801-0
00:53:20.693 --> 00:53:22.133
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then what is this?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5807-0
00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:24.733
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a supervised machine learning
algorithm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5817-0
00:53:25.213 --> 00:53:29.453
<v Hou, Eric>It's only using for classification task,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5834-0
00:53:29.453 --> 00:53:35.633
<v Hou, Eric>So then the idea is quite unique is is
apply the optimal hyperplane a separate</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5834-1
00:53:35.633 --> 00:53:36.493
<v Hou, Eric>data point?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5842-0
00:53:38.023 --> 00:53:38.943
<v Hou, Eric>With the maximized margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5853-0
00:53:38.943 --> 00:53:42.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then we talk about if you guys do
remember those dots, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5864-0
00:53:42.863 --> 00:53:48.183
<v Hou, Eric>So then we talk about what's the best way
to separate those blue and orange dots?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5871-0
00:53:50.023 --> 00:53:51.823
<v Hou, Eric>And then during our discussion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5874-0
00:53:52.173 --> 00:53:53.333
<v Hou, Eric>We said OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5891-0
00:53:54.773 --> 00:53:59.893
<v Hou, Eric>The vertical line B is the best way to
separate those two groups of dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5906-0
00:54:00.613 --> 00:54:08.149
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is is that optimizing the
maximum distance to the blue dots and and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5906-1
00:54:08.149 --> 00:54:11.773
<v Hou, Eric>orange dots, so am A and C will offer.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5908-0
00:54:13.223 --> 00:54:13.543
<v Hou, Eric>One side.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5928-0
00:54:15.143 --> 00:54:19.070
<v Hou, Eric>A bigger distance, however,
for the other side it will be smaller,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5928-1
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:23.583
<v Hou, Eric>so you will be really beneficial to
balance the distance from the two sides.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5932-0
00:54:24.013 --> 00:54:25.053
<v Hou, Eric>Think that's sort of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5940-0
00:54:26.983 --> 00:54:28.663
<v Hou, Eric>A discussion we had in the previous week.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5943-0
00:54:28.823 --> 00:54:30.103
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry, in the previous class.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5953-0
00:54:32.103 --> 00:54:35.063
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, and this is some examples we made,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5957-0
00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:36.983
<v Hou, Eric>So then we still believe that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5961-0
00:54:38.573 --> 00:54:40.253
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe B is the best one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5970-0
00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:48.263
<v Hou, Eric>So now we do have a two-dimensional world,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5977-0
00:54:48.263 --> 00:54:49.783
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have those black dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5986-0
00:54:49.783 --> 00:54:52.903
<v Hou, Eric>We have those white dots, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/5990-0
00:54:52.903 --> 00:54:54.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then in the X1X2 plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6011-0
00:54:56.463 --> 00:55:02.742
<v Hou, Eric>How we gonna separate them so clearly H1
is not separating the the black dots and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6011-1
00:55:02.742 --> 00:55:04.503
<v Hou, Eric>the and the white dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6021-0
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:11.103
<v Hou, Eric>So the only real two candidates are H2
and H3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6053-0
00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:21.008
<v Hou, Eric>So the difference between H2 and H3 is
the closest point to H2 offers a much</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6053-1
00:55:21.008 --> 00:55:26.303
<v Hou, Eric>smaller distance to H2 compared to H3,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6054-0
00:55:26.343 --> 00:55:27.463
<v Hou, Eric>So for example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6068-0
00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:34.336
<v Hou, Eric>You know this, this one,
this black dots and this white dots are</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6068-1
00:55:34.336 --> 00:55:35.183
<v Hou, Eric>the closest.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6082-0
00:55:37.263 --> 00:55:42.383
<v Hou, Eric>Point dots to H2 in each group and and
and then we will have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6084-0
00:55:42.383 --> 00:55:43.263
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just draw on this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6104-0
00:55:46.293 --> 00:55:50.271
<v Hou, Eric>So we'll have this and this as a
difference.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6104-1
00:55:50.271 --> 00:55:53.453
<v Hou, Eric>Separating those two groups of dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6121-0
00:55:53.973 --> 00:55:58.353
<v Hou, Eric>However,
consider H3 this and this will be the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6121-1
00:55:58.353 --> 00:56:02.733
<v Hou, Eric>distances separating those two groups of
dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6131-0
00:56:02.933 --> 00:56:07.364
<v Hou, Eric>Apparently this is a.
This is a bigger distance compared to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6131-1
00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:07.733
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6145-0
00:56:07.893 --> 00:56:14.413
<v Hou, Eric>This H3H2, so making H3A better candidate,
separating those two groups of dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6155-0
00:56:14.573 --> 00:56:17.733
<v Hou, Eric>Because it offered uh, bigger uh,
distance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6158-0
00:56:18.093 --> 00:56:19.253
<v Hou, Eric>So that's sort of umm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6189-0
00:56:19.613 --> 00:56:26.670
<v Hou, Eric>That's what we we have discussed and now
we also make the example that what if we</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6189-1
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.801
<v Hou, Eric>we have chosen H3.
However we start having one,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6189-2
00:56:30.801 --> 00:56:36.653
<v Hou, Eric>why does on the other side and the one
black dot on the other side.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6205-0
00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:42.293
<v Hou, Eric>So then I think our conclusion is we
still consider H3 as good just because.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6211-0
00:56:43.023 --> 00:56:44.543
<v Hou, Eric>Those two does maybe.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6223-0
00:56:45.293 --> 00:56:48.573
<v Hou, Eric>Number one, they, they,
they they may be nominees.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6242-0
00:56:48.573 --> 00:56:54.655
<v Hou, Eric>#2 is still maximize the distance between
the majority of black and and white dots</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6242-1
00:56:54.655 --> 00:56:56.853
<v Hou, Eric>from the other another groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6251-0
00:56:57.053 --> 00:57:00.533
<v Hou, Eric>So then we still consider H3 as a better.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6258-0
00:57:01.943 --> 00:57:04.103
<v Hou, Eric>Better way to separate those two groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6310-0
00:57:06.253 --> 00:57:12.746
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then we're saying, OK,
what we're doing by choosing H3 is to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6310-1
00:57:12.746 --> 00:57:16.957
<v Hou, Eric>maximizing the margin between those two
groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6310-2
00:57:16.957 --> 00:57:24.239
<v Hou, Eric>When I say margin is the distance between
the closest out to the hyperplane H3 for</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6310-3
00:57:24.239 --> 00:57:28.713
<v Hou, Eric>the black group that is this distance and
for the.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6322-0
00:57:28.703 --> 00:57:32.053
<v Hou, Eric>For the group of Y DOS that is this
distance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6329-0
00:57:32.823 --> 00:57:35.023
<v Hou, Eric>We're maximizing the width of this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6331-0
00:57:35.693 --> 00:57:36.253
<v Hou, Eric>This band.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6348-0
00:57:37.813 --> 00:57:41.869
<v Hou, Eric>That is exactly what we're doing. However,
compared to H2,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6348-1
00:57:41.869 --> 00:57:44.893
<v Hou, Eric>the distance of the band is just too
small.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6351-0
00:57:45.333 --> 00:57:46.973
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why we are not.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6354-0
00:57:47.253 --> 00:57:47.693
<v Hou, Eric>We are.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6367-0
00:57:47.693 --> 00:57:53.413
<v Hou, Eric>We should not always consider H2 as a as
a as a way to separate those two groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6375-0
00:57:55.143 --> 00:57:58.223
<v Hou, Eric>And then we gave another example that OK,
so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6387-0
00:57:59.823 --> 00:58:07.423
<v Hou, Eric>This is one example we are seeing in X1
and X2 plane where.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6412-0
00:58:09.183 --> 00:58:17.556
<v Hou, Eric>Where X1 and X2 can be consider a
projection of higher dimensional plane to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6412-1
00:58:17.556 --> 00:58:23.063
<v Hou, Eric>this to this two-dimensional 2
dimensional plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6419-0
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:28.723
<v Hou, Eric>So the H2, sorry H3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6423-0
00:58:29.693 --> 00:58:31.093
<v Hou, Eric>It's a.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6430-0
00:58:31.093 --> 00:58:33.173
<v Hou, Eric>It's a line in the two-dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6452-0
00:58:33.453 --> 00:58:37.239
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if you see this H3 in a three-dimensional</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6452-1
00:58:37.239 --> 00:58:41.173
<v Hou, Eric>world, it's it's a it's a plane,
it's a hyper plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6457-0
00:58:41.173 --> 00:58:42.853
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is going to be a look.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6472-0
00:58:43.093 --> 00:58:48.096
<v Hou, Eric>It will look like this,
so it will be expanded to this way and it</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6472-1
00:58:48.096 --> 00:58:50.293
<v Hou, Eric>will be expanded to this way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6478-0
00:58:50.453 --> 00:58:51.853
<v Hou, Eric>So it will be a plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6490-0
00:58:51.933 --> 00:58:54.933
<v Hou, Eric>But however,
if you project it to X1 and X2,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6490-1
00:58:54.933 --> 00:58:56.333
<v Hou, Eric>it looks like a line.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6495-0
00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:57.133
<v Hou, Eric>But it is not.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6497-0
00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:58.093
<v Hou, Eric>It's a hyper plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6517-0
00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:05.252
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is and and and also in the in
the three-dimensional world,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6517-1
00:59:05.252 --> 00:59:07.503
<v Hou, Eric>those may not be thoughts.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6521-0
00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:10.023
<v Hou, Eric>Those thoughts could be spheres, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6529-0
00:59:10.023 --> 00:59:12.463
<v Hou, Eric>Could be boss and then and then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6549-0
00:59:12.463 --> 00:59:17.881
<v Hou, Eric>Now we are really talking about 3
dimensional world where we're saying this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6549-1
00:59:17.881 --> 00:59:19.663
<v Hou, Eric>X3 is just one dimension.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6568-0
00:59:19.743 --> 00:59:22.618
<v Hou, Eric>However,
this X3 could be could be two dimensions,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6568-1
00:59:22.618 --> 00:59:25.943
<v Hou, Eric>could be 3 dimensions,
and then we just write in this way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6575-0
00:59:26.133 --> 00:59:28.853
<v Hou, Eric>Of a three-dimensional world. So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6612-0
00:59:30.343 --> 00:59:36.704
<v Hou, Eric>This this dot could be really spheres of
N dimensional spheres and then or or N</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6612-1
00:59:36.704 --> 00:59:42.747
<v Hou, Eric>dimensional cylinders so they they they
can have a different possibilities.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6612-2
00:59:42.747 --> 00:59:48.551
<v Hou, Eric>Just looking at A2 dimensional
twodimensional world projection they look</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6612-3
00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:49.823
<v Hou, Eric>like dots right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6619-0
00:59:49.823 --> 00:59:52.983
<v Hou, Eric>So then we're really looking at a plane,
how to separate those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6623-0
00:59:55.063 --> 00:59:56.543
<v Hou, Eric>In dimensional objects.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6633-0
01:00:00.203 --> 01:00:03.643
<v Hou, Eric>So so I think this is something new.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6634-0
01:00:04.203 --> 01:00:05.763
<v Hou, Eric>However, this is really.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6636-0
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:15.823
<v Hou, Eric>Calculus.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6646-0
01:00:17.343 --> 01:00:21.143
<v Hou, Eric>102 I would say definitely not calculus
101.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6649-0
01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:24.303
<v Hou, Eric>So the question is given this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6656-0
01:00:25.903 --> 01:00:27.223
<v Hou, Eric>So the way I'm running this is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6668-0
01:00:29.263 --> 01:00:32.103
<v Hou, Eric>Wt is transposed over West by X + B.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6674-0
01:00:34.303 --> 01:00:36.103
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys know what transpose is?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6676-0
01:00:39.513 --> 01:00:40.153
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>No.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6678-0
01:00:40.563 --> 01:00:40.963
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6687-0
01:00:43.183 --> 01:00:46.863
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so I for one dimension, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6698-0
01:00:46.863 --> 01:00:55.903
<v Hou, Eric>So then if I have a WX plus B equals to 0,
do you know what what this is?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6707-0
01:00:59.513 --> 01:01:03.993
<v Hou, Eric>Suppose I know WI know B those are known.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6713-0
01:01:04.353 --> 01:01:07.753
<v Hou, Eric>Do you know what does this this equation?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6719-0
01:01:07.753 --> 01:01:10.233
<v Hou, Eric>What does this equation mean?
For example like let me say.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6732-0
01:01:11.743 --> 01:01:16.783
<v Hou, Eric>One One X + 2 equal to 0. What?
What is this?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6736-0
01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:19.663
<v Hou, Eric>In two-dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6745-0
01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:35.693
<v Hou, Eric>This in the two-dimensional world you
have X&amp;Y.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6755-0
01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:39.703
<v Hou, Eric>One X + 2 equal to 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6759-0
01:01:39.703 --> 01:01:41.423
<v Hou, Eric>That means X = -, 2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6762-0
01:01:41.423 --> 01:01:43.783
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a line, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6767-0
01:01:45.423 --> 01:01:46.423
<v Hou, Eric>That is a line here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6797-0
01:01:46.423 --> 01:01:53.752
<v Hou, Eric>So this is X + 2 equals to 0.
So for whatever Y on this on this on this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6797-1
01:01:53.752 --> 01:02:00.063
<v Hou, Eric>vertical line it satisfy this this
equation X + 2 equal to 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6799-0
01:02:01.653 --> 01:02:02.013
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6815-0
01:02:03.663 --> 01:02:12.063
<v Hou, Eric>And then we can generalize this idea,
where W could be W1 and W2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6822-0
01:02:13.823 --> 01:02:16.223
<v Hou, Eric>Where so we can consider this as a vector.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6825-0
01:02:18.303 --> 01:02:18.583
<v Hou, Eric>Do you?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6832-0
01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:22.623
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys learn a concept of vector
right vector?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6839-0
01:02:27.033 --> 01:02:28.593
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I have, yes, but it's been a little while.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6844-0
01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:27.363
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yep.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6843-0
01:02:28.643 --> 01:02:29.243
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6859-0
01:02:29.283 --> 01:02:36.963
<v Hou, Eric>OK, lachter,
so lachter let's say W is W1 and W2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6865-0
01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:41.483
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a single letter representing 2
numbers.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6878-0
01:02:42.903 --> 01:02:47.543
<v Hou, Eric>And in that sense,
the ax is not going to be an ax anymore.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6890-0
01:02:47.623 --> 01:02:51.792
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just erase all those
onedimensional things you guys already</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6890-1
01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:52.103
<v Hou, Eric>know.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6892-0
01:02:53.823 --> 01:02:54.143
<v Hou, Eric>It's good.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6903-0
01:02:58.613 --> 01:03:04.373
<v Hou, Eric>So X will be a vector of two numbers X1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6905-0
01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:06.143
<v Hou, Eric>And X2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6914-0
01:03:09.463 --> 01:03:14.543
<v Hou, Eric>And B will be vector of two numbers B1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6917-0
01:03:16.063 --> 01:03:16.703
<v Hou, Eric>And B2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6919-0
01:03:19.593 --> 01:03:19.953
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6921-0
01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:21.463
<v Hou, Eric>W.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6945-0
01:03:21.533 --> 01:03:28.059
<v Hou, Eric>T is a transpose of this vector,
so this vector looks like a vertical</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6945-1
01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:32.253
<v Hou, Eric>vector so that you have ax one,
you have X2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6959-0
01:03:32.253 --> 01:03:39.053
<v Hou, Eric>So to transpose of this one will be
horizontal X1 and W1 and W2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6967-0
01:03:40.703 --> 01:03:43.743
<v Hou, Eric>So wt, multiply X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6981-0
01:03:44.663 --> 01:03:50.823
<v Hou, Eric>So there will be this transpose transpose
a vector W one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6983-0
01:03:50.823 --> 01:03:54.223
<v Hou, Eric>After 2, multiply this original vector.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/6987-0
01:03:54.973 --> 01:03:57.413
<v Hou, Eric>X1 and X2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7002-0
01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:14.133
<v Hou, Eric>And then let's let's assume this B is is
just one constant, just B.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7006-0
01:04:15.783 --> 01:04:16.983
<v Hou, Eric>Dimensional B OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7010-0
01:04:19.543 --> 01:04:20.743
<v Hou, Eric>So in this case.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7020-0
01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:27.463
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys remember the matrix
multiplication?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7031-0
01:04:30.593 --> 01:04:33.233
<v Hou, Eric>If you have X W1W2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7038-0
01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:35.993
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply this vertical X1X22.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7039-0
01:04:35.993 --> 01:04:36.953
<v Hou, Eric>What is the results?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7047-0
01:04:39.733 --> 01:04:44.933
<v Hou, Eric>The result will be this W 1 multiplied X1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7055-0
01:04:46.423 --> 01:04:49.863
<v Hou, Eric>Plus this W2 multiply X2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7062-0
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.343
<v Hou, Eric>This is what this term represent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7082-0
01:04:54.743 --> 01:04:58.563
<v Hou, Eric>So now if we just consider B as a
constant,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7082-1
01:04:58.563 --> 01:05:02.383
<v Hou, Eric>so then this equation literally mean W
1X1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7084-0
01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:05.223
<v Hou, Eric>Plus.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7086-0
01:05:06.183 --> 01:05:06.343
<v Hou, Eric>West.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7088-0
01:05:06.343 --> 01:05:06.823
<v Hou, Eric>2X2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7094-0
01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:10.983
<v Hou, Eric>Plus a BYU equal to 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7096-0
01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:13.323
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7104-0
01:05:15.303 --> 01:05:18.263
<v Hou, Eric>This is exactly what this formula means.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7106-0
01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:20.573
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7112-0
01:05:22.173 --> 01:05:25.293
<v Hou, Eric>We we we discuss if W one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7120-0
01:05:26.943 --> 01:05:28.743
<v Hou, Eric>Or W2 equal to 0 right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7128-0
01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:31.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then we know it's just a line in in
one-dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7141-0
01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:36.983
<v Hou, Eric>But what if W1 and W2 both are not equal
to 0?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7147-0
01:05:39.493 --> 01:05:43.813
<v Hou, Eric>W1W2 both are not 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7152-0
01:05:45.303 --> 01:05:47.143
<v Hou, Eric>And what does this represent?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7156-0
01:05:55.403 --> 01:05:57.003
<v Hou, Eric>So this represent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7160-0
01:06:02.493 --> 01:06:03.413
<v Benbenek, MATT>The hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7169-0
01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:07.283
<v Hou, Eric>That's a hyperplane in this
three-dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7172-0
01:06:07.283 --> 01:06:07.963
<v Hou, Eric>Let's call it Z.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7174-0
01:06:08.843 --> 01:06:11.403
<v Hou, Eric>Could be someone like this?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7176-0
01:06:13.453 --> 01:06:14.333
<v Hou, Eric>It'll be a hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7195-0
01:06:15.863 --> 01:06:19.649
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
however it is aligned in a 2D world,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7195-1
01:06:19.649 --> 01:06:21.623
<v Hou, Eric>but it is what it means.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7199-0
01:06:21.623 --> 01:06:22.143
<v Hou, Eric>It's three.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7201-0
01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:23.783
<v Hou, Eric>D World is a hyper plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7215-0
01:06:25.423 --> 01:06:33.703
<v Hou, Eric>So so any difference between a point to
this to this line will be following this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7215-1
01:06:33.703 --> 01:06:34.623
<v Hou, Eric>equation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7234-0
01:06:36.303 --> 01:06:39.824
<v Hou, Eric>However,
any point in higher end dimensional world</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7234-1
01:06:39.824 --> 01:06:44.863
<v Hou, Eric>to that plane will be similar to that
formula will be looking like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7236-0
01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:45.453
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7249-0
01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:51.323
<v Hou, Eric>So you just plug in its X1X2 XN to this
formula.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7266-0
01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:58.423
<v Hou, Eric>And and then and then divide it by the
square root of all the weights.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7278-0
01:06:58.423 --> 01:07:02.475
<v Hou, Eric>That will be your your distance from that
point to the hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7278-1
01:07:02.475 --> 01:07:03.623
<v Hou, Eric>You know like here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7283-0
01:07:03.623 --> 01:07:08.063
<v Hou, Eric>You have a point.
Here's your hyperplane and.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7288-0
01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.333
<v Hou, Eric>And here is going to be your distance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7299-0
01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:20.423
<v Hou, Eric>To the the the projection of that point
to this hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7304-0
01:07:20.693 --> 01:07:21.853
<v Hou, Eric>And this is a formula.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7316-0
01:07:22.453 --> 01:07:27.059
<v Hou, Eric>So you don't have to know,
you can just remember memorize the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7316-1
01:07:27.059 --> 01:07:27.653
<v Hou, Eric>formula.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7322-0
01:07:28.053 --> 01:07:30.373
<v Hou, Eric>So what you can just use it right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7340-0
01:07:30.373 --> 01:07:39.028
<v Hou, Eric>So then for any single point to this H3,
you have a way to calculate the distance,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7340-1
01:07:39.028 --> 01:07:39.653
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7348-0
01:07:39.653 --> 01:07:41.693
<v Hou, Eric>You have a way to calculate the distance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7349-0
01:07:42.173 --> 01:07:43.853
<v Hou, Eric>Let's assume that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7352-0
01:07:46.023 --> 01:07:46.583
<v Hou, Eric>I I have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7356-0
01:07:48.263 --> 01:07:49.663
<v Hou, Eric>All the group of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7370-0
01:07:50.053 --> 01:07:54.973
<v Hou, Eric>A black point to reach a three is bigger
than this D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7381-0
01:07:56.373 --> 01:08:03.213
<v Hou, Eric>And then let's say all the points of here
are less than minus D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7386-0
01:08:04.053 --> 01:08:05.133
<v Hou, Eric>So what does that mean?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7388-0
01:08:05.133 --> 01:08:06.253
<v Hou, Eric>So it's sort of like here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7394-0
01:08:09.173 --> 01:08:09.733
<v Hou, Eric>Here's ad.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7396-0
01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:12.093
<v Hou, Eric>Here's a -, D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7399-0
01:08:13.943 --> 01:08:13.983
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7409-0
01:08:13.983 --> 01:08:19.583
<v Hou, Eric>Do some magic rotation.
I can have all the blacks points in here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7415-0
01:08:19.663 --> 01:08:21.583
<v Hou, Eric>All the Y points in here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7421-0
01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:25.703
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then this is my H3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7438-0
01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:33.943
<v Hou, Eric>This Y axis is my H3 so that I have all
the black dots here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7443-0
01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.193
<v Hou, Eric>I have all the white dots here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7455-0
01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:44.783
<v Hou, Eric>So that I have all the black dots that
leads to the H3. There's a vertical line.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7490-0
01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:52.183
<v Hou, Eric>Have a distance bigger than D because
this is definitely on the right hand side</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7490-1
01:08:52.183 --> 01:08:55.855
<v Hou, Eric>of this,
this this X = d hyperplane and I have all</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7490-2
01:08:55.855 --> 01:08:57.943
<v Hou, Eric>the Y dots less than minus D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7491-0
01:08:58.503 --> 01:08:59.063
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7497-0
01:09:01.263 --> 01:09:02.183
<v Hou, Eric>This minus D to D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7500-0
01:09:04.903 --> 01:09:05.783
<v Hou, Eric>This kind of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7515-0
01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:18.900
<v Hou, Eric>And this kind of a band is separating
those two two different two different</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7515-1
01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:21.573
<v Hou, Eric>groups of of of dots. So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7535-0
01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:32.300
<v Hou, Eric>This sort of is the idea of SVM can be
find a magic number D to separate two</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7535-1
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.303
<v Hou, Eric>different groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7537-0
01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:36.183
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7568-0
01:09:39.833 --> 01:09:45.464
<v Hou, Eric>It is not that obvious to see in this
chart, because in this chart,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7568-1
01:09:45.464 --> 01:09:51.673
<v Hou, Eric>how do you say this one is positive and
how do you say this one's minus D?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7580-0
01:09:52.273 --> 01:09:56.473
<v Hou, Eric>So the way how you do that is actually a
rotation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7589-0
01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:01.913
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you can always define
another X axis.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7598-0
01:10:01.913 --> 01:10:07.153
<v Hou, Eric>Here that is orthogonal to this H3 plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7599-0
01:10:07.433 --> 01:10:08.033
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7605-0
01:10:08.743 --> 01:10:10.263
<v Hou, Eric>You define this as actually your X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7640-0
01:10:10.853 --> 01:10:16.521
<v Hou, Eric>And this is actually your D and this is
your minus D you can always do this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7640-1
01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:22.263
<v Hou, Eric>rotation like you gonna rotate in this
way and then you do this rotation and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7640-2
01:10:22.263 --> 01:10:25.693
<v Hou, Eric>then you you see this and then this
rotation.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7655-0
01:10:27.263 --> 01:10:33.216
<v Hou, Eric>So we can mathematically we can do it
free for you and after rotation you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7655-1
01:10:33.216 --> 01:10:34.503
<v Hou, Eric>project this to.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7665-0
01:10:37.903 --> 01:10:40.063
<v Hou, Eric>Xy XY2D plane so that you can define.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7683-0
01:10:40.173 --> 01:10:45.403
<v Hou, Eric>And DN minus D, so we can say, hey,
those black dots are bigger than D and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7683-1
01:10:45.403 --> 01:10:47.773
<v Hou, Eric>these Y dots are minus negative D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7691-0
01:10:47.973 --> 01:10:51.973
<v Hou, Eric>So those two groups of dots are separated
by.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7697-0
01:10:53.503 --> 01:10:55.143
<v Hou, Eric>A 2D with band.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7700-0
01:10:55.423 --> 01:10:58.223
<v Hou, Eric>So that's is the idea.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7728-0
01:10:58.703 --> 01:11:05.644
<v Hou, Eric>So if we say this guy is bigger than D
and this guy is less than minus D,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7728-1
01:11:05.644 --> 01:11:12.303
<v Hou, Eric>I'm literally utilizing the the formula
for each dot to this H3 plane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7752-0
01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:16.374
<v Hou, Eric>I have that distance and then I have that
distance.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7752-1
01:11:16.374 --> 01:11:21.913
<v Hou, Eric>I want those guys bigger than D and I
want those guys minus less than D my less</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7752-2
01:11:21.913 --> 01:11:22.813
<v Hou, Eric>than minus D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7778-0
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:27.245
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
since the D as a distance is definitely</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7778-1
01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:30.881
<v Hou, Eric>bigger than 0,
I can divide the two side of the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7778-2
01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:32.093
<v Hou, Eric>inequality by D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7784-0
01:11:32.773 --> 01:11:35.573
<v Hou, Eric>That's why I have this and that's why I
have this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7791-0
01:11:37.173 --> 01:11:40.573
<v Hou, Eric>So we can always normalize.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7803-0
01:11:42.343 --> 01:11:49.703
<v Hou, Eric>The denominator to make everything here
equal to one, we can always do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7825-0
01:11:49.863 --> 01:11:55.650
<v Hou, Eric>So if we do that,
I just can cancel out this denominator to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7825-1
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.543
<v Hou, Eric>make this formula look better.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7841-0
01:11:58.543 --> 01:12:03.914
<v Hou, Eric>So when I define,
the black dots are Y equal to one and I</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7841-1
01:12:03.914 --> 01:12:05.303
<v Hou, Eric>define those Y.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7847-0
01:12:05.303 --> 01:12:07.583
<v Hou, Eric>Dots are y = -, 1 I have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7853-0
01:12:08.303 --> 01:12:09.823
<v Hou, Eric>When I'm talking about the black dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7857-0
01:12:11.743 --> 01:12:13.503
<v Hou, Eric>I have this numerator.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7885-0
01:12:13.773 --> 01:12:20.563
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna want just because I defy my
denominator equal to 1 so that I can just</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7885-1
01:12:20.563 --> 01:12:27.173
<v Hou, Eric>ignore it and I can say all the Y dots
which I define them as Y equal -1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7908-0
01:12:27.293 --> 01:12:32.736
<v Hou, Eric>I have the numerator less than -1,
so then I can do a trick that is a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7908-1
01:12:32.736 --> 01:12:38.333
<v Hou, Eric>multiplication of those two.
I can successfully cancel this minus sign.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7917-0
01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.303
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I have this formula in the
end.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7945-0
01:12:42.293 --> 01:12:46.451
<v Hou, Eric>So for all the machine learning books you
you'll be,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7945-1
01:12:46.451 --> 01:12:50.139
<v Hou, Eric>you'll see that SVM is requiring this
formula,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7945-2
01:12:50.139 --> 01:12:54.453
<v Hou, Eric>and this is exactly where this formula is
coming from.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7951-0
01:12:55.093 --> 01:12:58.253
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is not that hard.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7957-0
01:12:58.453 --> 01:13:01.573
<v Hou, Eric>However,
you have to go through all those steps.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7967-0
01:13:01.573 --> 01:13:05.333
<v Hou, Eric>In the end you have this formula and this
is the formula.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7970-0
01:13:05.653 --> 01:13:07.813
<v Hou, Eric>You know the the the computer science.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7976-0
01:13:08.543 --> 01:13:10.063
<v Hou, Eric>Programmer gonna base upon.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7995-0
01:13:11.873 --> 01:13:17.592
<v Hou, Eric>Without being sad.
You what you need to remember the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7995-1
01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:20.073
<v Hou, Eric>remember is so the SVM.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/7998-0
01:13:20.873 --> 01:13:24.873
<v Hou, Eric>The idea is how can we find?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8016-0
01:13:25.713 --> 01:13:35.454
<v Hou, Eric>A 2D width band to separate those two
group of points in an dimensional in a N</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8016-1
01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:37.673
<v Hou, Eric>dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8047-0
01:13:39.193 --> 01:13:47.580
<v Hou, Eric>And the center hyper plane of that 2D
with band is the hyperplane we are going</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8047-1
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:55.753
<v Hou, Eric>to use to separate those two groups of
two groups of two two groups of dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8052-0
01:13:56.303 --> 01:13:57.623
<v Hou, Eric>Or two groups of data.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8058-0
01:13:59.313 --> 01:14:00.953
<v Hou, Eric>That is how the SVM is working.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8064-0
01:14:03.593 --> 01:14:05.793
<v Hou, Eric>Essentially, in an N dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8101-0
01:14:07.473 --> 01:14:13.441
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully that's making sense to you guys,
but but this is a really the math</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8101-1
01:14:13.441 --> 01:14:19.253
<v Hou, Eric>background behind this and you can
definitely read this slide after class,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8101-2
01:14:19.253 --> 01:14:23.593
<v Hou, Eric>but you don't have to follow every single
stab in here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8114-0
01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:28.389
<v Hou, Eric>You can just remember sort of making
sense of the SVM is finding one</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8114-1
01:14:28.389 --> 01:14:29.153
<v Hou, Eric>hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8125-0
01:14:29.903 --> 01:14:33.663
<v Hou, Eric>To separate two different groups of dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8132-0
01:14:33.663 --> 01:14:36.800
<v Hou, Eric>That's the idea.
If you have that idea in your mind,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8132-1
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.983
<v Hou, Eric>that's great enough.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8155-0
01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:47.478
<v Hou, Eric>So this is sort of the we are just
looking for that hyperplane that is our</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8155-1
01:14:47.478 --> 01:14:52.003
<v Hou, Eric>job to run in the codes to finding to
find the best SVM.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8160-0
01:14:53.913 --> 01:14:54.473
<v Hou, Eric>Where the margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8163-0
01:14:54.473 --> 01:14:57.953
<v Hou, Eric>The margin is the width of the band.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8165-0
01:14:59.873 --> 01:14:59.993
<v Hou, Eric>How?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8176-0
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:05.193
<v Hou, Eric>How how much margin is basically we're
talking about how big the yud is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8187-0
01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:10.323
<v Hou, Eric>The objective is really to maximize the
margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8205-0
01:15:10.323 --> 01:15:14.616
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
so you if you remember the H2 and H3 the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8205-1
01:15:14.616 --> 01:15:20.243
<v Hou, Eric>two ways of separated and then why we
chose H3 is through.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8216-0
01:15:21.713 --> 01:15:27.313
<v Hou, Eric>This step to minimize this by maximizing
this by maximizing the margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8233-0
01:15:30.423 --> 01:15:35.543
<v Hou, Eric>And there is a two different margins like
what we have discussed.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8240-0
01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:41.703
<v Hou, Eric>One is called hard margin where in hard
margin literally there is no.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8250-0
01:15:43.593 --> 01:15:49.393
<v Hou, Eric>Dots from the opposite group is within
that band, for example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8263-0
01:15:51.033 --> 01:15:57.420
<v Hou, Eric>I can clearly separate those two group of
dots that is called margin the soft</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8263-1
01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:57.993
<v Hou, Eric>margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8271-0
01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:04.903
<v Hou, Eric>Can I just take one step back?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8275-0
01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:07.223
<v Hou, Eric>Can I have a margin or hyperplane?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8282-0
01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:12.663
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of block a separate majority of
those two groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8302-0
01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:19.273
<v Hou, Eric>With knowing that some of those points
are still within that margin,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8302-1
01:16:19.273 --> 01:16:23.353
<v Hou, Eric>but still a win for me,
so that is called soft margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8318-0
01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:30.267
<v Hou, Eric>The difference between hard margin and
soft margin is whether or not there is a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8318-1
01:16:30.267 --> 01:16:32.393
<v Hou, Eric>tolerance for class Miss Classic.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8320-0
01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:33.103
<v Hou, Eric>Occasion.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8330-0
01:16:34.143 --> 01:16:39.743
<v Hou, Eric>For hard there's no tolerance for soft
there are some tiny.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8335-0
01:16:41.193 --> 01:16:43.033
<v Hou, Eric>Misclassification that is allowed.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8348-0
01:16:44.713 --> 01:16:47.493
<v Hou, Eric>A party,
if you can find a hard margin to separate</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8348-1
01:16:47.493 --> 01:16:48.473
<v Hou, Eric>the two groups of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8368-0
01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Hou, Eric>That's definitely a better,
best case scenario,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8368-1
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:58.713
<v Hou, Eric>but you you may not end up with having a
higher margin all the time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8376-0
01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:02.833
<v Hou, Eric>It's really eventually really like
whether or not you solve.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8385-0
01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:05.943
<v Hou, Eric>Ad prop. 80% of the problem.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8401-0
01:17:06.423 --> 01:17:12.206
<v Hou, Eric>So if 8020 rule is still works and then
if you believe in that rule so then you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8401-1
01:17:12.206 --> 01:17:14.663
<v Hou, Eric>may believe soft margin will work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8403-0
01:17:16.783 --> 01:17:17.183
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8425-0
01:17:19.233 --> 01:17:26.062
<v Hou, Eric>So here is how we really separate those
those two data so that I have this blue</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8425-1
01:17:26.062 --> 01:17:28.793
<v Hou, Eric>dots, I have the cross and then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8440-0
01:17:30.673 --> 01:17:36.713
<v Hou, Eric>So how to visualize SVM is here is 1
hyperplane.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8445-0
01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:37.833
<v Hou, Eric>Separate those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8449-0
01:17:38.113 --> 01:17:40.713
<v Hou, Eric>So then you definitely have those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8457-0
01:17:42.313 --> 01:17:45.753
<v Hou, Eric>Those blue dots in here,
you definitely have those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8477-0
01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:52.932
<v Hou, Eric>Crossing here and definitely you can see
this is is a soft margin just because you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8477-1
01:17:52.932 --> 01:17:55.783
<v Hou, Eric>do have some misclassification in each.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8484-0
01:17:57.423 --> 01:18:00.503
<v Hou, Eric>The separate region, so it is soft margin.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8486-0
01:18:07.443 --> 01:18:07.843
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8501-0
01:18:11.663 --> 01:18:18.169
<v Hou, Eric>So this is already using a linear
function out of box SVM to to separate</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8501-1
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.703
<v Hou, Eric>those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8513-0
01:18:18.743 --> 01:18:23.343
<v Hou, Eric>And then there's a concept you said is
using linear kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8518-0
01:18:23.343 --> 01:18:25.023
<v Hou, Eric>So what is a kernel?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8531-0
01:18:25.143 --> 01:18:32.623
<v Hou, Eric>So kernel is one function that is helping
us to separate those dots.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8535-0
01:18:33.063 --> 01:18:35.423
<v Hou, Eric>You can totally ignore those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8540-0
01:18:36.143 --> 01:18:37.823
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just take a look at one example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8545-0
01:18:39.543 --> 01:18:41.383
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say we do have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8559-0
01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:50.793
<v Hou, Eric>Those red rectangles surrounded by those
green dots, right? So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8570-0
01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:55.353
<v Hou, Eric>That's considered as.
Just imagine that a linear function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8576-0
01:18:55.353 --> 01:18:58.153
<v Hou, Eric>How can we use a linear function to
separate?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8592-0
01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:07.058
<v Hou, Eric>Those red dots from those green dots or
those red rectangles from those green</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8592-1
01:19:07.058 --> 01:19:07.753
<v Hou, Eric>circles?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8607-0
01:19:08.623 --> 01:19:12.555
<v Hou, Eric>There's no way,
because every single linear function</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8607-1
01:19:12.555 --> 01:19:16.783
<v Hou, Eric>you're trying,
you'll have a lot of a misclassification.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8615-0
01:19:17.743 --> 01:19:20.863
<v Hou, Eric>What we are thinking as a human being is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8623-0
01:19:22.393 --> 01:19:25.753
<v Hou, Eric>How about we can find a circle here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8654-0
01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:33.462
<v Hou, Eric>That will be the best case scenario,
but the way how to find a circle is quite</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8654-1
01:19:33.462 --> 01:19:36.947
<v Hou, Eric>tricky in machine learning.
Just because this circle,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8654-2
01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:40.883
<v Hou, Eric>how do you define in each circle what is
the margin between?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8668-0
01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:46.113
<v Hou, Eric>This red rectangle region versus the the
green circle region.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8680-0
01:19:46.113 --> 01:19:51.593
<v Hou, Eric>That's so hard where we can just apply
this kernel kind of concept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8681-0
01:19:51.993 --> 01:19:54.073
<v Hou, Eric>What kernel mean?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8685-0
01:19:54.073 --> 01:19:55.993
<v Hou, Eric>The kernel is just a function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8687-0
01:19:57.713 --> 01:19:57.953
<v Hou, Eric>Like.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8713-0
01:19:59.143 --> 01:20:02.353
<v Hou, Eric>Like all the functions we were talking
about,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8713-1
01:20:02.353 --> 01:20:08.143
<v Hou, Eric>the kernel is adding more is solving this
problem by adding more complexity to it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8723-0
01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:14.863
<v Hou, Eric>So now we have those red rectangles and
and green circles in 2D world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8729-0
01:20:16.393 --> 01:20:17.913
<v Hou, Eric>In circles we can actually.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8744-0
01:20:19.673 --> 01:20:25.153
<v Hou, Eric>Adding or transforming those 2D dots or
rectangles into 3D World.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8751-0
01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:29.673
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can make these two D we can
project these two D.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8763-0
01:20:31.703 --> 01:20:37.583
<v Hou, Eric>Sets of points to a 3D World and
hopefully we can make it like.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8767-0
01:20:39.073 --> 01:20:39.713
<v Hou, Eric>This mountain.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8807-0
01:20:39.713 --> 01:20:44.812
<v Hou, Eric>Kind of shape. If we do,
if we are able to do that and then the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8807-1
01:20:44.812 --> 01:20:51.185
<v Hou, Eric>way how to separate this is really easy
because those red rectangles are on the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8807-2
01:20:51.185 --> 01:20:57.559
<v Hou, Eric>top of this mount and those green circles
on the bottom of this, this mountain,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8807-3
01:20:57.559 --> 01:20:58.833
<v Hou, Eric>so that you can.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8809-0
01:20:58.833 --> 01:20:59.153
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8817-0
01:21:00.503 --> 01:21:02.383
<v Hou, Eric>Block them from the middle of the month.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8823-0
01:21:02.783 --> 01:21:04.903
<v Hou, Eric>That is the way how to separate them.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8838-0
01:21:05.183 --> 01:21:12.517
<v Hou, Eric>So this kernel is doing that trick is to
provide to solve the problem by adding</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8838-1
01:21:12.517 --> 01:21:13.983
<v Hou, Eric>some complexity.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8842-0
01:21:13.983 --> 01:21:17.303
<v Hou, Eric>Usually that is helping like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8865-0
01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:22.169
<v Hou, Eric>However,
how you their the default kernel we're</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8865-1
01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:25.574
<v Hou, Eric>using is cutting the plane by a linear
function,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8865-2
01:21:25.574 --> 01:21:28.353
<v Hou, Eric>so we're actually using a linear kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8884-0
01:21:28.703 --> 01:21:31.959
<v Hou, Eric>So.
So this is sort of way to say that for</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8884-1
01:21:31.959 --> 01:21:37.183
<v Hou, Eric>every time you run the SVM,
we are assuming we have a linear kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8909-0
01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:42.024
<v Hou, Eric>But we can always apply different non
linear kernels.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8909-1
01:21:42.024 --> 01:21:46.273
<v Hou, Eric>A polynomial kernel with the RBF kernel
to transfer.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8927-0
01:21:46.383 --> 01:21:51.063
<v Hou, Eric>The data to either 3 dimensional world or
four dimensional world.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8930-0
01:21:51.063 --> 01:21:54.303
<v Hou, Eric>That's actually easier for us to separate
them.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8947-0
01:21:55.833 --> 01:22:00.376
<v Hou, Eric>So that this is how you will be using
kernel and it is how the kernel is</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8947-1
01:22:00.376 --> 01:22:00.873
<v Hou, Eric>working.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8950-0
01:22:02.593 --> 01:22:02.793
<v Hou, Eric>In SVM.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8955-0
01:22:04.793 --> 01:22:05.873
<v Hou, Eric>But good news is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8965-0
01:22:07.593 --> 01:22:11.033
<v Hou, Eric>The SVM is one step earlier than your
network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8976-0
01:22:12.633 --> 01:22:16.713
<v Hou, Eric>With neural network you do not have to
define a kernel ourselves.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8994-0
01:22:17.543 --> 01:22:21.323
<v Hou, Eric>And you and I were gonna do that work for
you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/8994-1
01:22:21.323 --> 01:22:25.183
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the reason why the SVM is so
popular.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9038-0
01:22:26.593 --> 01:22:32.545
<v Hou, Eric>For a period of the time and later on,
I don't think a lot of people are still</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9038-1
01:22:32.545 --> 01:22:38.874
<v Hou, Eric>using SVM because the neural network can
do a much convenient work for us than SVM.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9038-2
01:22:38.874 --> 01:22:44.751
<v Hou, Eric>At least I didn't use SVM quite often,
but you need to understand this kernel</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9038-3
01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:45.353
<v Hou, Eric>concept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9043-0
01:22:45.353 --> 01:22:47.313
<v Hou, Eric>Is bringing more complexity.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9054-0
01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:53.033
<v Hou, Eric>And and transfer this data and it's
actually easier to solve.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9056-0
01:22:55.063 --> 01:22:55.943
<v Hou, Eric>So for example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9070-0
01:22:57.713 --> 01:23:02.553
<v Hou, Eric>In A2 dimensional world we have those
zeros and ones looks like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9073-0
01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:03.753
<v Hou, Eric>I understand.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9074-0
01:23:03.753 --> 01:23:05.313
<v Hou, Eric>It's sort of like.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9098-0
01:23:07.073 --> 01:23:12.973
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's really difficult to to to
separate because if you use any linear</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9098-1
01:23:12.973 --> 01:23:18.793
<v Hou, Eric>function you see this linear function is
not helping us separating those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9102-0
01:23:20.433 --> 01:23:21.113
<v Hou, Eric>Two groups of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9109-0
01:23:23.033 --> 01:23:25.833
<v Hou, Eric>Blue dots and then and the red crosses.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9112-0
01:23:26.743 --> 01:23:28.183
<v Hou, Eric>It's just impossible.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9139-0
01:23:29.413 --> 01:23:36.537
<v Hou, Eric>What we are hoping is we hope to have a
boundary like this to separate those two</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9139-1
01:23:36.537 --> 01:23:42.693
<v Hou, Eric>groups, but as you can see,
that is definitely not a linear function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9148-0
01:23:42.693 --> 01:23:46.333
<v Hou, Eric>It is definitely a nonlinear function
here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9158-0
01:23:46.373 --> 01:23:51.093
<v Hou, Eric>So then we really cannot use a linear
kernel to achieve this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9166-0
01:23:51.173 --> 01:23:55.293
<v Hou, Eric>So you will need some nonlinear kernels
to achieve this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9185-0
01:23:57.253 --> 01:24:03.344
<v Hou, Eric>So using linear function you couldn't do
that and even use a polynomial and so</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9185-1
01:24:03.344 --> 01:24:05.733
<v Hou, Eric>nonlinear is really hard to do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9202-0
01:24:07.163 --> 01:24:10.155
<v Hou, Eric>Well,
actually I'm using a polynomial here,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9202-1
01:24:10.155 --> 01:24:12.603
<v Hou, Eric>so that is sort of a doing this way.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9210-0
01:24:12.683 --> 01:24:15.723
<v Hou, Eric>So there's only one missing,
which is awesome.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9216-0
01:24:16.363 --> 01:24:17.923
<v Hou, Eric>And I tried RBF.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9220-0
01:24:17.923 --> 01:24:19.723
<v Hou, Eric>It's even more missing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9244-0
01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:27.115
<v Hou, Eric>So then at least you can achieve that is
achieve like 95% of work which is why the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9244-1
01:24:27.115 --> 01:24:32.163
<v Hou, Eric>kernels are so great in achieving those
two those tasks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9252-0
01:24:33.623 --> 01:24:36.023
<v Hou, Eric>So however the the caveat is that you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9264-0
01:24:36.413 --> 01:24:41.093
<v Hou, Eric>Only you will need to choose the right
kernel all the time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9265-0
01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:42.973
<v Hou, Eric>Sometimes you have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9283-0
01:24:43.013 --> 01:24:48.067
<v Hou, Eric>You can visualize the data in this way,
so then you can see that the boundary has</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9283-1
01:24:48.067 --> 01:24:49.053
<v Hou, Eric>to be nonlinear.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9310-0
01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:54.706
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can choose a nonlinear kernel,
but sometimes that you you you do not you.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9310-1
01:24:54.706 --> 01:24:59.373
<v Hou, Eric>If you don't visualize the data,
you cannot choose a nonlinear kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9312-0
01:24:59.413 --> 01:25:01.293
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's reason why.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9319-0
01:25:01.983 --> 01:25:03.783
<v Hou, Eric>Your your end result may not be so great,
OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9332-0
01:25:06.513 --> 01:25:13.007
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you the code how I generate
those results and then we can take a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9332-1
01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:13.513
<v Hou, Eric>break.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9342-0
01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:17.973
<v Hou, Eric>And then when we come back,
we talk about the neural networks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9346-0
01:25:26.943 --> 01:25:27.383
<v Hou, Eric>The reason?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9365-0
01:25:27.383 --> 01:25:33.119
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just moving this SVM so quickly just
because this is something that one last</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9365-1
01:25:33.119 --> 01:25:36.943
<v Hou, Eric>traditional machine learning model we're
gonna cover.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9368-0
01:25:37.223 --> 01:25:38.903
<v Hou, Eric>I really wanna finish this one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9374-0
01:25:38.903 --> 01:25:41.303
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can have more time on your
network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9378-0
01:25:42.473 --> 01:25:43.113
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9381-0
01:25:43.113 --> 01:25:45.833
<v Hou, Eric>Here's the SVM code.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9390-0
01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:52.163
<v Hou, Eric>So only thing that is different is you
will be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9401-0
01:25:57.613 --> 01:26:02.373
<v Hou, Eric>So you'll be importing this SVC function
so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9446-0
01:26:04.383 --> 01:26:10.240
<v Hou, Eric>From this SVM package of SK learn OK,
all the other things are are the same,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9446-1
01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.803
<v Hou, Eric>so you still make the classifications and
then I this is a.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9446-2
01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:20.583
<v Hou, Eric>This is a way I'm making that example the
moon example I'll show you later.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9451-0
01:26:20.623 --> 01:26:22.943
<v Hou, Eric>And this is you do the train test lead.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9455-0
01:26:24.623 --> 01:26:24.903
<v Hou, Eric>You just.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9460-0
01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:28.023
<v Hou, Eric>You just import logistic regression as
before.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9476-0
01:26:28.733 --> 01:26:32.733
<v Hou, Eric>You have all different kind of score from
metrics.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9479-0
01:26:32.973 --> 01:26:34.293
<v Hou, Eric>You have those accuracy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9498-0
01:26:34.293 --> 01:26:38.925
<v Hou, Eric>You have those classification.
You have those confusion matrix and here</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9498-1
01:26:38.925 --> 01:26:42.013
<v Hou, Eric>are those are the explanation of those
metrics.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9514-0
01:26:43.463 --> 01:26:51.583
<v Hou, Eric>So first I just generate some linear
separable examples like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9529-0
01:26:51.663 --> 01:26:56.639
<v Hou, Eric>The first example I'm showing you guys,
I I I definitely split into train and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9529-1
01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:59.063
<v Hou, Eric>half and then the data look like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9557-0
01:27:00.153 --> 01:27:05.311
<v Hou, Eric>So if I do try a linear regression for
sorry logistic regression,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9557-1
01:27:05.311 --> 01:27:10.860
<v Hou, Eric>so the result isn't that bad,
so I just misclassify those five dots in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9557-2
01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.673
<v Hou, Eric>here so that I do have accuracy 88%.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9569-0
01:27:14.613 --> 01:27:19.413
<v Hou, Eric>I do have my iPhone score pretty decent,
so it's not bad.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9571-0
01:27:20.733 --> 01:27:20.853
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9584-0
01:27:22.773 --> 01:27:29.733
<v Hou, Eric>If I try I just train this SVM model
using the SVC function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9591-0
01:27:29.733 --> 01:27:31.773
<v Hou, Eric>I say the kernel is linear.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9614-0
01:27:31.853 --> 01:27:37.001
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I see kernel is linear is I I
sort of can see that a Direct Line of</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9614-1
01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:39.933
<v Hou, Eric>disk could separate those those data
points.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9621-0
01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.173
<v Hou, Eric>So now I just train a model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9634-0
01:27:42.453 --> 01:27:48.973
<v Hou, Eric>I feed a train and a train train and then
test it on the test data set.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9640-0
01:27:49.173 --> 01:27:51.813
<v Hou, Eric>So I I can see this is not even as good.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9678-0
01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:56.851
<v Hou, Eric>As the logistic regression as you can see,
the logistic regression,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9678-1
01:27:56.851 --> 01:28:01.552
<v Hou, Eric>I do have 88% accuracy.
I only misclassify those five points and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9678-2
01:28:01.552 --> 01:28:06.253
<v Hou, Eric>here I misclassify not only those five of
one additional points.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9682-0
01:28:06.253 --> 01:28:08.173
<v Hou, Eric>And that's why my accuracy is even lower.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9695-0
01:28:09.973 --> 01:28:14.173
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly,
the the F1 scores are not looking so bad.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9710-0
01:28:14.453 --> 01:28:19.586
<v Hou, Eric>So then what I can say is,
at least for those are linear function,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9710-1
01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:23.493
<v Hou, Eric>linear function,
separable datasets I don't think.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9732-0
01:28:24.843 --> 01:28:29.730
<v Hou, Eric>The the support vector machine is
providing tremendous value compared to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9732-1
01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:34.683
<v Hou, Eric>logistic regression because from this
example they are really comparable.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9734-0
01:28:34.813 --> 01:28:35.373
<v Hou, Eric>If not worse.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9744-0
01:28:36.983 --> 01:28:40.583
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can see how we separate those
boundaries.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9762-0
01:28:40.823 --> 01:28:45.080
<v Hou, Eric>The only thing that gonna make a huge
difference is to use is make more</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9762-1
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.503
<v Hou, Eric>functions that you're gonna start seeing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9763-0
01:28:47.503 --> 01:28:48.983
<v Hou, Eric>The data looks like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9775-0
01:28:50.623 --> 01:28:53.863
<v Hou, Eric>That is definitely not separable by
logistic regression.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9787-0
01:28:53.903 --> 01:29:01.221
<v Hou, Eric>You do logistic regression.
You see that still achieving 90% by doing</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9787-1
01:29:01.221 --> 01:29:01.743
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9800-0
01:29:02.923 --> 01:29:06.563
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really like the best
logistic regression can do.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9824-0
01:29:06.603 --> 01:29:12.227
<v Hou, Eric>Just find a a linear linear line to
separate those two groups of data.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9824-1
01:29:12.227 --> 01:29:18.563
<v Hou, Eric>But as you can see from visualization
perspective, a lot of misclassifications.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9846-0
01:29:18.683 --> 01:29:24.499
<v Hou, Eric>The reason we still achieve the 90%
accuracy is we are only taking a into</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9846-1
01:29:24.499 --> 01:29:27.563
<v Hou, Eric>account of the tasks data set. I don't.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9852-0
01:29:28.263 --> 01:29:30.983
<v Hou, Eric>Consider the the train. So then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9863-0
01:29:31.893 --> 01:29:34.933
<v Hou, Eric>That's why it is not so bad 90%.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9887-0
01:29:35.813 --> 01:29:39.933
<v Hou, Eric>But if I put the train and task together,
you can definitely see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9887-1
01:29:39.933 --> 01:29:44.989
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely see that we are we are
misclassifying a lot of data points in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9887-2
01:29:44.989 --> 01:29:47.173
<v Hou, Eric>here in this in this on this chart.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9908-0
01:29:48.013 --> 01:29:52.862
<v Hou, Eric>However,
let's do this support vector machine SVM</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9908-1
01:29:52.862 --> 01:29:57.613
<v Hou, Eric>so that we know the linear separator
won't work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9938-0
01:29:57.613 --> 01:30:01.596
<v Hou, Eric>So then this the first time we say, hey,
that's the choose,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9938-1
01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:06.440
<v Hou, Eric>the kernel to be a polynomial,
and we chose to use degree code to three,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9938-2
01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.493
<v Hou, Eric>and you can definitely try different
degrees.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9939-0
01:30:09.493 --> 01:30:12.253
<v Hou, Eric>Three is you. You're saying.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9956-0
01:30:13.063 --> 01:30:18.423
<v Hou, Eric>We allow X ^3 terms and X ^2 terms in
this in this kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9965-0
01:30:18.973 --> 01:30:22.053
<v Hou, Eric>How we project those data to a different
plane?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/9972-0
01:30:22.573 --> 01:30:27.133
<v Hou, Eric>So you try this this SVM model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10003-0
01:30:27.133 --> 01:30:32.934
<v Hou, Eric>You try this polynomial kernel and now
you see the accuracy is 97% compared to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10003-1
01:30:32.934 --> 01:30:38.294
<v Hou, Eric>logistic regression which is 90.
And from visualization perspective this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10003-2
01:30:38.294 --> 01:30:43.653
<v Hou, Eric>looks much better than the linear
functions separating those two groups.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10005-0
01:30:44.383 --> 01:30:44.783
<v Hou, Eric>Because.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10008-0
01:30:46.063 --> 01:30:46.383
<v Hou, Eric>Your I see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10026-0
01:30:47.183 --> 01:30:53.063
<v Hou, Eric>The way how they partition the entire
plane, I'm so convinced that that is one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10029-0
01:30:53.063 --> 01:30:55.423
<v Hou, Eric>This one is definitely better, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10043-0
01:30:55.623 --> 01:31:01.042
<v Hou, Eric>And then also you can try this RBF and
then the result is comparable 97.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10043-1
01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:02.303
<v Hou, Eric>So it seems like.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10062-0
01:31:03.823 --> 01:31:07.766
<v Hou, Eric>The real comparison is nonlinear kernel
versus linear kernel,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10062-1
01:31:07.766 --> 01:31:11.263
<v Hou, Eric>where the linear kernel is just a
logistic regression.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10074-0
01:31:12.373 --> 01:31:15.243
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then so then in the data to to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10074-1
01:31:15.243 --> 01:31:17.693
<v Hou, Eric>separate the data looks like those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10084-0
01:31:19.423 --> 01:31:23.263
<v Hou, Eric>Certainly nonlinear.
You use a nonlinear kernel to separate</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10084-1
01:31:23.263 --> 01:31:23.583
<v Hou, Eric>them.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10091-0
01:31:25.623 --> 01:31:28.303
<v Hou, Eric>And then code is super simple.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10120-0
01:31:28.303 --> 01:31:34.600
<v Hou, Eric>You just need to call this SVC function.
You just need to define a kernel.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10120-1
01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:38.881
<v Hou, Eric>You have only three options, linear,
Poly and RBS.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10120-2
01:31:38.881 --> 01:31:41.903
<v Hou, Eric>When you say linear just say linear.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10138-0
01:31:42.173 --> 01:31:45.844
<v Hou, Eric>And then when you say polynomial,
you need to define a degree and a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10138-1
01:31:45.844 --> 01:31:48.813
<v Hou, Eric>coefficient 0.
Whether or not you allow the intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10152-0
01:31:49.443 --> 01:31:52.758
<v Hou, Eric>You can try different values whenever
give you the best accuracy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10152-1
01:31:52.758 --> 01:31:53.963
<v Hou, Eric>You can choose that one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10187-0
01:31:55.463 --> 01:32:01.312
<v Hou, Eric>And and then you just fit based upon your
training train X and train Y and that's</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10187-1
01:32:01.312 --> 01:32:07.089
<v Hou, Eric>how you build a model in those two lines
of code you have your model and you can</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10187-2
01:32:07.089 --> 01:32:10.583
<v Hou, Eric>just evaluate based upon your test X and
test Y.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10191-0
01:32:10.783 --> 01:32:12.463
<v Hou, Eric>You do your prediction.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10196-0
01:32:12.463 --> 01:32:15.223
<v Hou, Eric>You compare your prediction versus the
actual.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10199-0
01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.383
<v Hou, Eric>Values so then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10213-0
01:32:18.693 --> 01:32:24.047
<v Hou, Eric>In that you have this classification
confusion matrix and the classification</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10213-1
01:32:24.047 --> 01:32:24.533
<v Hou, Eric>report.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10219-0
01:32:24.733 --> 01:32:28.711
<v Hou, Eric>Remember,
this SVM can only work on classification</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10219-1
01:32:28.711 --> 01:32:29.413
<v Hou, Eric>problems.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10238-0
01:32:29.653 --> 01:32:36.135
<v Hou, Eric>And you are not going to use this SVM to
to solve any regression problem where the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10238-1
01:32:36.135 --> 01:32:37.853
<v Hou, Eric>regression problem is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10245-0
01:32:39.343 --> 01:32:41.503
<v Hou, Eric>To predict the continuous Y values.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10249-0
01:32:43.263 --> 01:32:43.423
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10260-0
01:32:43.423 --> 01:32:47.943
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the quick version of touch
based on the SVM.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10277-0
01:32:48.543 --> 01:32:54.337
<v Hou, Eric>So now we can officially close all the
conventional machine learning models and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10277-1
01:32:54.337 --> 01:32:58.103
<v Hou, Eric>then we can start talking about the
neural network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10281-0
01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:01.893
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions before break?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10283-0
01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.103
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>No.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10286-0
01:33:09.193 --> 01:33:09.873
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10291-0
01:33:10.353 --> 01:33:12.153
<v Hou, Eric>No, no question, right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10299-0
01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.233
<v Hou, Eric>It's I upload the codes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10300-0
01:33:14.233 --> 01:33:17.313
<v Hou, Eric>It should be pretty simple.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10310-0
01:33:18.783 --> 01:33:21.863
<v Hou, Eric>And then let's take a 15 minute break.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10325-0
01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:27.663
<v Hou, Eric>We come back 721 and and we will start
talking about neural networks, OK?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10333-0
01:33:29.383 --> 01:33:33.423
<v Hou, Eric>I'll see you guys in 50 minutes.
15 minutes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10436-0
01:49:05.703 --> 01:49:06.503
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10438-0
01:49:06.503 --> 01:49:07.823
<v Hou, Eric>Welcome back.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10440-0
01:49:10.193 --> 01:49:11.113
<v Hou, Eric>Scoring.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10442-0
01:49:14.213 --> 01:49:14.893
<v Hou, Eric>All right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10445-0
01:49:16.823 --> 01:49:17.143
<v Hou, Eric>Can you guys hear me?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10448-0
01:49:19.253 --> 01:49:19.573
<v Mertens, Aidric>Jim.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10449-0
01:49:20.223 --> 01:49:20.503
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10452-0
01:49:22.143 --> 01:49:22.663
<v Hou, Eric>OK so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10476-0
01:49:25.103 --> 01:49:32.418
<v Hou, Eric>We'll be moving slowly or neural network.
We'll be moving much smaller than the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10476-1
01:49:32.418 --> 01:49:36.623
<v Hou, Eric>previous models in your network. OK,
so then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10494-0
01:49:38.743 --> 01:49:42.189
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is this model starting from
neural network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10494-1
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:45.383
<v Hou, Eric>Actually we're we're dealing with the
black boxes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10502-0
01:49:47.633 --> 01:49:51.553
<v Hou, Eric>Will be losing the sign of how the model
works.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10520-0
01:49:53.663 --> 01:49:57.546
<v Hou, Eric>But we we know the structure, OK,
we we we the structure we know them how</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10520-1
01:49:57.546 --> 01:49:58.543
<v Hou, Eric>we build the model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10534-0
01:49:59.143 --> 01:50:02.454
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually,
how the model is generated,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10534-1
01:50:02.454 --> 01:50:06.743
<v Hou, Eric>some of the results is it's it's really
hard to explain.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10541-0
01:50:07.143 --> 01:50:11.183
<v Hou, Eric>So you'll have to learn how to read the
reports.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10547-0
01:50:12.823 --> 01:50:13.583
<v Hou, Eric>Coming out of the model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10552-0
01:50:14.023 --> 01:50:16.863
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the only way that you start.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10558-0
01:50:18.583 --> 01:50:21.063
<v Hou, Eric>Sensing how the model really works OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10564-0
01:50:21.733 --> 01:50:23.933
<v Hou, Eric>So then we gonna move really slowly.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10584-0
01:50:25.423 --> 01:50:28.675
<v Hou, Eric>From now on,
so really I've I I I need to make sure</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10584-1
01:50:28.675 --> 01:50:31.863
<v Hou, Eric>every single staff you understand what's
going on.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10591-0
01:50:32.653 --> 01:50:34.133
<v Hou, Eric>Before we move further.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10597-0
01:50:34.133 --> 01:50:37.413
<v Hou, Eric>So then we let's just spend today to
review.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10629-0
01:50:38.863 --> 01:50:43.656
<v Hou, Eric>Some of the concepts and I hope you
understand it so that we don't have to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10629-1
01:50:43.656 --> 01:50:47.745
<v Hou, Eric>spend more time on it,
but I think some investment on review is</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10629-2
01:50:47.745 --> 01:50:48.703
<v Hou, Eric>still valuable.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10632-0
01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:50.743
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10645-0
01:50:51.383 --> 01:50:58.303
<v Hou, Eric>So first thing is I do want you guys to
review one thing that's called chain rule.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10646-0
01:50:58.823 --> 01:50:59.943
<v Hou, Eric>The reason?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10655-0
01:51:01.543 --> 01:51:05.943
<v Hou, Eric>Why Chain rule is so important is?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10670-0
01:51:07.623 --> 01:51:10.925
<v Hou, Eric>Eventually,
if you think through the neural network</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10670-1
01:51:10.925 --> 01:51:14.543
<v Hou, Eric>and then you won't say, hey,
what is the most important?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10691-0
01:51:15.573 --> 01:51:19.717
<v Hou, Eric>What are the most important concept we
gonna use in your network?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10691-1
01:51:19.717 --> 01:51:24.173
<v Hou, Eric>And one of those most important concept
be using in neural network is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10697-0
01:51:24.293 --> 01:51:26.013
<v Hou, Eric>Chair roll. OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10704-0
01:51:26.493 --> 01:51:31.053
<v Hou, Eric>So then I believe you guys learn it in
calculus 101.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10713-0
01:51:32.253 --> 01:51:38.133
<v Hou, Eric>But not just take one step back to review
the change rule.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10718-0
01:51:38.213 --> 01:51:38.893
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10732-0
01:51:39.213 --> 01:51:46.474
<v Hou, Eric>So the chain rule is solving a problem
that we gonna take the derivative of H of</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10732-1
01:51:46.474 --> 01:51:46.653
<v Hou, Eric>X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10745-0
01:51:48.263 --> 01:51:55.743
<v Hou, Eric>Where H of X is a function F of a
function G of X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10761-0
01:51:57.543 --> 01:52:05.449
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
for example H of X equals two X + 3 to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10761-1
01:52:05.449 --> 01:52:08.023
<v Hou, Eric>the Q. OK now.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10765-0
01:52:08.493 --> 01:52:09.853
<v Hou, Eric>We can consider.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10780-0
01:52:11.503 --> 01:52:16.423
<v Hou, Eric>That F of X = X ^3 and G of X = 2 + X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10812-0
01:52:19.183 --> 01:52:25.319
<v Hou, Eric>So then I know F of G of X equals two X +
3 ^3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10812-1
01:52:25.319 --> 01:52:30.303
<v Hou, Eric>Just plug in two X + 3 and this F of X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10820-0
01:52:30.463 --> 01:52:35.623
<v Hou, Eric>You have this H of X.
So let's say we have H of X equals this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10828-0
01:52:37.623 --> 01:52:43.063
<v Hou, Eric>The derivative of H in terms of X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10833-0
01:52:44.583 --> 01:52:46.463
<v Hou, Eric>Actually is not like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10840-0
01:52:54.173 --> 01:52:57.093
<v Hou, Eric>Is the derivative of F.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10853-0
01:52:59.163 --> 01:53:02.483
<v Hou, Eric>By plug in geovax,
multiply the derivative of G.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10869-0
01:53:03.803 --> 01:53:09.923
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
I know my H of X equals two X + 3 ^3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10890-0
01:53:10.803 --> 01:53:21.283
<v Hou, Eric>I know my F of X = X ^3 my G of X equals
two X + 3. My derivative of F is 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10891-0
01:53:21.643 --> 01:53:24.203
<v Hou, Eric>X ^2 you have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10904-0
01:53:24.823 --> 01:53:29.543
<v Hou, Eric>The you have the exponential piece to the
friend and then the 3 -, 1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10909-0
01:53:29.813 --> 01:53:31.933
<v Hou, Eric>I have a three X square.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10914-0
01:53:32.613 --> 01:53:34.653
<v Hou, Eric>I have the derivative of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10919-0
01:53:36.503 --> 01:53:37.543
<v Hou, Eric>G with respect to X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10928-0
01:53:39.463 --> 01:53:40.823
<v Hou, Eric>Equals to two.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10939-0
01:53:41.383 --> 01:53:51.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then the derivative of H of X with
respect to X is the derivative of F.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10954-0
01:53:53.953 --> 01:53:59.580
<v Hou, Eric>Of two plus two X + 3, which is G.
Multiply the two,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10954-1
01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:02.233
<v Hou, Eric>which is derivative of G.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10968-0
01:54:04.093 --> 01:54:10.173
<v Hou, Eric>So then I know the derivative of F is
three X ^2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10986-0
01:54:10.453 --> 01:54:17.133
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have F prime equal 3 X squared
and I plug in X equal to two X + 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/10987-0
01:54:17.133 --> 01:54:18.093
<v Hou, Eric>I have 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11000-0
01:54:19.583 --> 01:54:24.743
<v Hou, Eric>Two X + 3 ^2 multiply 2 which is 6.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11005-0
01:54:24.783 --> 01:54:27.823
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply by two X + 3 ^2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11013-0
01:54:28.873 --> 01:54:34.303
<v Hou, Eric>And this is how the chain rule works.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11015-0
01:54:34.533 --> 01:54:34.573
<v Hou, Eric>S.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11025-0
01:54:36.653 --> 01:54:42.013
<v Hou, Eric>Any question how I calculate the
derivative of H of X?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11028-0
01:54:43.623 --> 01:54:44.503
<v Hou, Eric>In this example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11030-0
01:54:52.213 --> 01:54:52.893
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11037-0
01:54:54.743 --> 01:54:57.463
<v Hou, Eric>Then I do have a group work.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11050-0
01:54:59.573 --> 01:55:04.653
<v Hou, Eric>The HL fax equals E to the three X + 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11082-0
01:55:05.293 --> 01:55:14.069
<v Hou, Eric>I have H of X = 1 / 1 + E to the XI want
to set up the rooms for you guys to spend</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11082-1
01:55:14.069 --> 01:55:20.413
<v Hou, Eric>5 minutes on both of them and eventually
give me an answer.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11090-0
01:55:20.493 --> 01:55:24.733
<v Hou, Eric>What are the derivative of those two
different H of X?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11092-0
01:55:25.543 --> 01:55:25.783
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11099-0
01:55:27.503 --> 01:55:31.583
<v Hou, Eric>You can do Google, but you in this time.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11103-0
01:55:31.933 --> 01:55:33.773
<v Hou, Eric>I'm trying not to use.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11144-0
01:55:35.263 --> 01:55:41.512
<v Hou, Eric>AI try to have a piece of paper and write
it down or discuss with your peers and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11144-1
01:55:41.512 --> 01:55:47.683
<v Hou, Eric>the figure out and answer yourself. OK,
because this chain rule will be really,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11144-2
01:55:47.683 --> 01:55:50.383
<v Hou, Eric>really important in neural network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11158-0
01:55:50.583 --> 01:55:55.198
<v Hou, Eric>I want you at least to have a hands on
session for, for,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11158-1
01:55:55.198 --> 01:55:57.303
<v Hou, Eric>for for this 5 minutes OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11161-0
01:55:57.623 --> 01:55:59.063
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll set up a room.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11165-0
01:55:59.303 --> 01:56:00.823
<v Hou, Eric>So separate rooms.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11170-0
01:56:00.823 --> 01:56:02.703
<v Hou, Eric>So then you guys spend 5 minutes over
there.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11172-0
01:56:03.603 --> 01:56:03.883
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11175-0
01:56:05.703 --> 01:56:06.623
<v Hou, Eric>Let me do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11320-0
02:06:19.233 --> 02:06:19.593
<v Hou, Eric>All right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11339-0
02:06:19.593 --> 02:06:26.121
<v Hou, Eric>Did you guys figure it out the the
derivative of those two hlvx functions?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11339-1
02:06:26.121 --> 02:06:27.513
<v Hou, Eric>Sure, my screen.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11342-0
02:06:29.973 --> 02:06:30.653
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11343-0
02:06:30.993 --> 02:06:31.953
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11354-0
02:06:33.343 --> 02:06:37.503
<v Hou, Eric>We want to be the volunteer for for the
first one so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11357-0
02:06:39.823 --> 02:06:40.223
<v Hou, Eric>E2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11360-0
02:06:40.223 --> 02:06:41.583
<v Hou, Eric>The three X + 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11362-0
02:06:46.113 --> 02:06:47.433
<v Benbenek, MATT>So we did.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11375-0
02:06:49.013 --> 02:06:53.773
<v Benbenek, MATT>We we came up with 3 * E to the three X +
3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11380-0
02:06:56.063 --> 02:06:58.143
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect. So it's correct.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11385-0
02:07:00.013 --> 02:07:02.133
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, let me just uh, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11388-0
02:07:02.893 --> 02:07:03.733
<v Hou, Eric>It should.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11391-0
02:07:04.453 --> 02:07:04.813
<v Hou, Eric>I'm of the X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11399-0
02:07:05.653 --> 02:07:09.373
<v Hou, Eric>So you're saying A/C call 3E2 now?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11402-0
02:07:11.903 --> 02:07:12.863
<v Hou, Eric>E2 the.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11405-0
02:07:14.983 --> 02:07:15.423
<v Hou, Eric>Ah, Rex.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11412-0
02:07:17.933 --> 02:07:20.013
<v Hou, Eric>That sucks. That is perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11415-0
02:07:20.413 --> 02:07:22.133
<v Hou, Eric>How how did you do that, Matt?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11420-0
02:07:23.793 --> 02:07:25.913
<v Benbenek, MATT>So you use the chain rule.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11422-0
02:07:26.373 --> 02:07:26.573
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11424-0
02:07:27.133 --> 02:07:27.973
<v Benbenek, MATT>And then.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11446-0
02:07:29.963 --> 02:07:38.144
<v Benbenek, MATT>Derivative of the exponent is 3 and then
derivative of E to whatever is always E</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11439-0
02:07:34.743 --> 02:07:34.943
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11446-1
02:07:38.144 --> 02:07:40.163
<v Benbenek, MATT>like the same thing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11448-0
02:07:41.723 --> 02:07:42.403
<v Hou, Eric>Correct.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11450-0
02:07:42.973 --> 02:07:43.493
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11479-0
02:07:49.643 --> 02:07:56.240
<v Hou, Eric>So a derivative of E to the X equal to E
to the X and AG of X equal 3X plus 3A</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11479-1
02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.243
<v Hou, Eric>derivative of G equal 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11486-0
02:07:58.243 --> 02:07:59.843
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you have a three here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11492-0
02:07:59.843 --> 02:08:02.163
<v Hou, Eric>You have AE 2, three X + 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11495-0
02:08:05.393 --> 02:08:06.393
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11498-0
02:08:06.393 --> 02:08:07.753
<v Hou, Eric>How about the second one?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11502-0
02:08:12.453 --> 02:08:14.893
<v Hou, Eric>Any luck? A second one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11510-0
02:08:15.293 --> 02:08:16.253
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah, we did.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11519-0
02:08:17.173 --> 02:08:24.733
<v Benbenek, MATT>We got negative E to the X / 1 + E to the
X ^2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11521-0
02:08:26.663 --> 02:08:27.223
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11534-0
02:08:39.213 --> 02:08:45.013
<v Hou, Eric>And then I guess you you saying Apple X
equals?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11537-0
02:08:48.743 --> 02:08:49.583
<v Hou, Eric>One or X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11542-0
02:08:53.663 --> 02:08:55.623
<v Hou, Eric>Or X to the -1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11545-0
02:08:55.543 --> 02:08:56.823
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah, X to the -1.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11554-0
02:08:57.313 --> 02:09:02.421
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
treating blacks equals one plus etuda X,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11554-1
02:09:02.421 --> 02:09:03.073
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11556-0
02:09:03.743 --> 02:09:04.063
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yep.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11561-0
02:09:08.213 --> 02:09:12.013
<v Hou, Eric>Say it's X to the -1 easier to see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11564-0
02:09:15.933 --> 02:09:16.173
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11579-0
02:09:16.173 --> 02:09:22.053
<v Hou, Eric>So then the durable X to the -1 is -1 X
to the -2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11598-0
02:09:23.053 --> 02:09:28.613
<v Hou, Eric>So then you plug in EE 1 + E to the X and
derivative of G is just E to the X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11620-0
02:09:28.613 --> 02:09:35.745
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why you have minus E to
the X / E to the E to the X 1 + E to the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11620-1
02:09:35.745 --> 02:09:37.973
<v Hou, Eric>X ^2. That's perfect. OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11630-0
02:09:37.973 --> 02:09:41.533
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a good review of chain rule.
So how I hope everybody.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11640-0
02:09:42.303 --> 02:09:46.663
<v Hou, Eric>Got you know their you know the memory
bag of chain rule.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11652-0
02:09:47.173 --> 02:09:51.493
<v Hou, Eric>Because we are certainly use that. OK,
so this is a first serve review.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11683-0
02:09:53.103 --> 02:09:59.715
<v Hou, Eric>A second review is so that we have touch
base on all the machine learning models</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11683-1
02:09:59.715 --> 02:10:05.183
<v Hou, Eric>and here is sort of the recipe how we
introduce those guys, right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11690-0
02:10:05.703 --> 02:10:10.143
<v Hou, Eric>So then first we need to have data, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11691-0
02:10:10.143 --> 02:10:11.103
<v Hou, Eric>Except for.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11698-0
02:10:12.983 --> 02:10:15.583
<v Hou, Eric>The the clustering analysis.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11706-0
02:10:19.223 --> 02:10:23.063
<v Hou, Eric>All the data that we have are labeled
data.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11738-0
02:10:24.823 --> 02:10:29.093
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning labeled data,
meaning that we have a classification.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11738-1
02:10:29.093 --> 02:10:33.083
<v Hou, Eric>We can say either they have a group,
one versus Group 2,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11738-2
02:10:33.083 --> 02:10:36.583
<v Hou, Eric>or Group One versus Group 2 versus Group
Group 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11743-0
02:10:36.583 --> 02:10:38.263
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have those labels.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11763-0
02:10:38.263 --> 02:10:46.418
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of groups they are or we have
we have a continuous value that we use to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11763-1
02:10:46.418 --> 02:10:49.103
<v Hou, Eric>to label one single set of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11766-0
02:10:50.063 --> 02:10:50.623
<v Hou, Eric>Information.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11773-0
02:10:51.013 --> 02:10:54.013
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then we have the house size.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11801-0
02:10:54.013 --> 02:10:57.596
<v Hou, Eric>We have the House number of rooms,
we have the location,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11801-1
02:10:57.596 --> 02:11:02.562
<v Hou, Eric>those kind of information and we put a
label on that set of information saying</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11801-2
02:11:02.562 --> 02:11:04.573
<v Hou, Eric>that is the price of that House.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11806-0
02:11:04.613 --> 02:11:06.693
<v Hou, Eric>So then we do have labeled data.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11834-0
02:11:08.383 --> 02:11:12.591
<v Hou, Eric>We do have independent variables for
independent variables.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11834-1
02:11:12.591 --> 02:11:15.886
<v Hou, Eric>Could be you know house size,
number of rooms,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11834-2
02:11:15.886 --> 02:11:20.023
<v Hou, Eric>the location of the house where the
dependent variable is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11836-0
02:11:20.023 --> 02:11:21.743
<v Hou, Eric>We use those independent variable.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11849-0
02:11:23.453 --> 02:11:26.373
<v Hou, Eric>To make that dependent variable makes
sense.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11866-0
02:11:26.493 --> 02:11:34.094
<v Hou, Eric>So why the hell is selling $1 million a
while while another house nearby only</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11866-1
02:11:34.094 --> 02:11:35.653
<v Hou, Eric>sells 1/2 of it?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11899-0
02:11:35.653 --> 02:11:38.629
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then we are using independent value,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11899-1
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:43.124
<v Hou, Eric>we independent variable to explain that
dependent variable or at least we</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11899-2
02:11:43.124 --> 02:11:47.253
<v Hou, Eric>consider dependent variable is a function
of independent variables.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11909-0
02:11:47.253 --> 02:11:50.653
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have a training data as a
first ever step.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11913-0
02:11:51.383 --> 02:11:52.583
<v Hou, Eric>The second step is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11935-0
02:11:52.973 --> 02:11:56.907
<v Hou, Eric>Is we choose uh,
a method that we gonna we gonna use.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11935-1
02:11:56.907 --> 02:12:02.296
<v Hou, Eric>We choose a decision function. What?
What decision function we're talking</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11935-2
02:12:02.296 --> 02:12:02.733
<v Hou, Eric>about.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11936-0
02:12:02.733 --> 02:12:03.373
<v Hou, Eric>Are we talking?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11945-0
02:12:03.373 --> 02:12:06.933
<v Hou, Eric>Where are we going to use logistic
regression?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11953-0
02:12:07.173 --> 02:12:09.773
<v Hou, Eric>Are we going to use a linear regression?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11956-0
02:12:09.813 --> 02:12:12.093
<v Hou, Eric>Are we going to use a tree model?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11966-0
02:12:13.663 --> 02:12:14.663
<v Hou, Eric>Are we going to use K NN?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11977-0
02:12:14.663 --> 02:12:21.703
<v Hou, Eric>So then we will decide a function to this
to to to make the decision for the.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/11988-0
02:12:22.733 --> 02:12:25.853
<v Hou, Eric>Dependent variable using all the
independent variables.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12001-0
02:12:25.933 --> 02:12:30.733
<v Hou, Eric>So we choose a decision function and then
we also choose a loss function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12019-0
02:12:30.733 --> 02:12:36.836
<v Hou, Eric>So how are we going to say,
how are we going to determine whether or</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12019-1
02:12:36.836 --> 02:12:38.693
<v Hou, Eric>not a model is ready?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12037-0
02:12:39.293 --> 02:12:46.573
<v Hou, Eric>So we we use a train and test speed,
we build a model based upon the decision</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12037-1
02:12:46.573 --> 02:12:48.253
<v Hou, Eric>function we chose.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12044-0
02:12:48.983 --> 02:12:52.423
<v Hou, Eric>And then we use a loss function to tell
us, hey.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12058-0
02:12:52.893 --> 02:12:57.613
<v Hou, Eric>My model is ready to use and this my
model is ready to use.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12084-0
02:12:58.213 --> 02:13:02.238
<v Hou, Eric>On the task data.
So the last function could be the last</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12084-1
02:13:02.238 --> 02:13:07.674
<v Hou, Eric>function could be mean squared error.
The last function could be entropy for</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12084-2
02:13:07.674 --> 02:13:08.733
<v Hou, Eric>classification.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12101-0
02:13:08.733 --> 02:13:14.924
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have to choose a method and
then we have to choose a way how to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12101-1
02:13:14.924 --> 02:13:17.813
<v Hou, Eric>quantify how good or bad our model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12108-0
02:13:19.223 --> 02:13:20.743
<v Hou, Eric>Is in terms of generating.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12122-0
02:13:22.463 --> 02:13:27.475
<v Hou, Eric>The predictions of the dependent
variables and then we need to define a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12122-1
02:13:27.475 --> 02:13:27.823
<v Hou, Eric>goal.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12162-0
02:13:28.413 --> 02:13:31.905
<v Hou, Eric>Assuming now we already define a loss
function,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12162-1
02:13:31.905 --> 02:13:35.833
<v Hou, Eric>our goal is we want to minimize the
prediction error.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12162-2
02:13:35.833 --> 02:13:40.998
<v Hou, Eric>We want to maximize F1 score.
We we we or we want to just sort of like</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12162-3
02:13:40.998 --> 02:13:44.053
<v Hou, Eric>were you guys working on a business right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12170-0
02:13:44.053 --> 02:13:46.333
<v Hou, Eric>So then we want to maximize revenue.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12182-0
02:13:46.333 --> 02:13:52.333
<v Hou, Eric>We want to maximize margin.
Sometimes the goal you are setting up may</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12182-1
02:13:52.333 --> 02:13:53.533
<v Hou, Eric>drive totally.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12191-0
02:13:54.303 --> 02:13:58.383
<v Hou, Eric>Two different models. For example,
if you want to maximize the revenue.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12224-0
02:13:59.053 --> 02:14:03.767
<v Hou, Eric>You may end up with some not so great
margin result. However,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12224-1
02:14:03.767 --> 02:14:09.925
<v Hou, Eric>if you want to maximize margin percent,
you may eventually have the best revenue</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12224-2
02:14:09.925 --> 02:14:10.533
<v Hou, Eric>results.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12230-0
02:14:10.603 --> 02:14:13.203
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to know what you want.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12265-0
02:14:13.363 --> 02:14:19.971
<v Hou, Eric>So then you are going to define a goal
and then the last step is we are going to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12265-1
02:14:19.971 --> 02:14:26.742
<v Hou, Eric>use a way to optimize the model and then
to achieve the goal that we have by using</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12265-2
02:14:26.742 --> 02:14:29.923
<v Hou, Eric>the decision function on loss function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12271-0
02:14:29.923 --> 02:14:31.883
<v Hou, Eric>So sort of, we are optimizing the model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12277-0
02:14:31.883 --> 02:14:34.123
<v Hou, Eric>This is the machine learning recipe.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12278-0
02:14:34.723 --> 02:14:35.483
<v Hou, Eric>The data.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12289-0
02:14:36.213 --> 02:14:40.573
<v Hou, Eric>The method we're going to use,
what goal we want to achieve.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12299-0
02:14:41.003 --> 02:14:43.683
<v Hou, Eric>And we run the iterations to achieve the
goal.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12305-0
02:14:43.723 --> 02:14:47.123
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a machine learning recipe,
right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12319-0
02:14:47.123 --> 02:14:51.163
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just give you guys some examples
that we already touch base on.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12331-0
02:14:51.323 --> 02:14:55.412
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
my prediction target might dependent</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12331-1
02:14:55.412 --> 02:14:57.803
<v Hou, Eric>variable is house price, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12340-0
02:14:57.803 --> 02:15:02.403
<v Hou, Eric>So then we definitely walk work on that
data set, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12344-0
02:15:02.403 --> 02:15:05.043
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have our independent variables.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12356-0
02:15:05.853 --> 02:15:09.933
<v Hou, Eric>We have the house size, the living room,
kitchen, basement, et cetera.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12374-0
02:15:10.723 --> 02:15:14.325
<v Hou, Eric>We have a number of rooms.
We have house conditions,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12374-1
02:15:14.325 --> 02:15:16.363
<v Hou, Eric>we have a location, et cetera.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12379-0
02:15:16.363 --> 02:15:18.443
<v Hou, Eric>Those are our independent variables.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12383-0
02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:20.723
<v Hou, Eric>We have those data right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12386-0
02:15:20.723 --> 02:15:21.203
<v Hou, Eric>We have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12427-0
02:15:21.243 --> 02:15:26.384
<v Hou, Eric>We have done that exercise and then we
through the journey before, for, for,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12427-1
02:15:26.384 --> 02:15:30.656
<v Hou, Eric>for the beginning to now we have tasks it
on linear regression.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12427-2
02:15:30.656 --> 02:15:34.929
<v Hou, Eric>We have tried the KNN,
we have tried the tree models and if you</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12427-3
02:15:34.929 --> 02:15:38.333
<v Hou, Eric>learn the loss function we use it's a
mean square.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12429-0
02:15:38.403 --> 02:15:38.683
<v Hou, Eric>Error.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12454-0
02:15:39.733 --> 02:15:46.088
<v Hou, Eric>So then what our goal is we want to mix
minimize the difference between the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12454-1
02:15:46.088 --> 02:15:49.933
<v Hou, Eric>predicted house price and actual house
price.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12477-0
02:15:50.043 --> 02:15:54.556
<v Hou, Eric>That is our goal,
and if you remember the way how we talk</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12477-1
02:15:54.556 --> 02:15:59.536
<v Hou, Eric>about the tree model,
we actually talk about one concept called</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12477-2
02:15:59.536 --> 02:16:01.403
<v Hou, Eric>gradient descent, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12493-0
02:16:01.403 --> 02:16:06.633
<v Hou, Eric>So then we take the small steps to
achieve the goal and then we take small</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12493-1
02:16:06.633 --> 02:16:09.003
<v Hou, Eric>steps to separate the tree, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12511-0
02:16:09.003 --> 02:16:14.166
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we take small steps to build
what kind of a number of neighborhood we</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12511-1
02:16:14.166 --> 02:16:16.843
<v Hou, Eric>should be using using KNN, right? So then?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12518-0
02:16:17.573 --> 02:16:19.173
<v Hou, Eric>This is how we predict the house price.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12526-0
02:16:19.683 --> 02:16:22.403
<v Hou, Eric>We are just directly following this
recipe.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12545-0
02:16:23.993 --> 02:16:29.208
<v Hou, Eric>And remember, we have done this.
This company bankruptcy example that this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12545-1
02:16:29.208 --> 02:16:31.433
<v Hou, Eric>this the classification example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12566-0
02:16:31.433 --> 02:16:36.642
<v Hou, Eric>So then we use their revenue margin
current ratio, quick ratio,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12566-1
02:16:36.642 --> 02:16:40.793
<v Hou, Eric>a lot of different ratios as independent
variable.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12576-0
02:16:40.793 --> 02:16:44.529
<v Hou, Eric>We are assuming that there is going to be
some.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12576-1
02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:47.953
<v Hou, Eric>There will be some leading indicators
that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12585-0
02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:52.493
<v Hou, Eric>Tells us whether or not a company is
going to bankrupt.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12596-0
02:16:53.463 --> 02:16:55.783
<v Hou, Eric>And then we try the logistic regression.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12638-0
02:16:55.783 --> 02:17:00.327
<v Hou, Eric>We try the tree models and then in those
mod, if you don't remember,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12638-1
02:17:00.327 --> 02:17:05.661
<v Hou, Eric>but we definitely use entropy function
and I'll remind you what entropy function</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12638-2
02:17:05.661 --> 02:17:08.690
<v Hou, Eric>is and then we want to maximize the
position,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12638-3
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:10.863
<v Hou, Eric>recall score as much as possible.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12652-0
02:17:10.983 --> 02:17:17.058
<v Hou, Eric>So and then using those tree models,
we definitely also use a gradient descent</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12652-1
02:17:17.058 --> 02:17:18.903
<v Hou, Eric>for logistic regression.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12662-0
02:17:18.903 --> 02:17:23.253
<v Hou, Eric>We didn't use much of optimization
because just just.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12675-0
02:17:23.403 --> 02:17:27.723
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty much like a one time running a
model, but we can definitely optimize it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12691-0
02:17:27.923 --> 02:17:34.963
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the recipe of machine learning
and what does it mean to neural network?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12698-0
02:17:35.203 --> 02:17:40.043
<v Hou, Eric>So neural network is a new class of
decision functions.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12722-0
02:17:40.323 --> 02:17:44.084
<v Hou, Eric>We're still gonna get the same training
data,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12722-1
02:17:44.084 --> 02:17:49.725
<v Hou, Eric>but now instead of in addition to tree
models and regression models,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12722-2
02:17:49.725 --> 02:17:53.403
<v Hou, Eric>we will add neural network to this
decision.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12727-0
02:17:53.483 --> 02:17:55.843
<v Hou, Eric>Functions right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12741-0
02:17:56.403 --> 02:18:01.882
<v Hou, Eric>But we're we're we're still going to use
existing loss functions that we have</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12741-1
02:18:01.882 --> 02:18:02.443
<v Hou, Eric>learned.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12753-0
02:18:02.523 --> 02:18:07.995
<v Hou, Eric>So how we tell the models good or bad?
We still use whatever we have already</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12753-1
02:18:07.995 --> 02:18:08.563
<v Hou, Eric>learned.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12768-0
02:18:08.603 --> 02:18:13.403
<v Hou, Eric>Nothing new in here,
but we just add one decision function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12768-1
02:18:13.403 --> 02:18:15.483
<v Hou, Eric>One family of models here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12772-0
02:18:18.373 --> 02:18:21.173
<v Hou, Eric>And this is too small.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12792-0
02:18:22.563 --> 02:18:27.022
<v Hou, Eric>And and then one thing we will add to the
optimization,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12792-1
02:18:27.022 --> 02:18:30.843
<v Hou, Eric>the goal will keep the goal the same as
before.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12809-0
02:18:30.883 --> 02:18:37.123
<v Hou, Eric>The bad propagation is one way we will be
using to optimize the neural networks.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12826-0
02:18:37.403 --> 02:18:45.869
<v Hou, Eric>So in addition to the gradient descent,
so then conceptually the back propagation</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12826-1
02:18:45.869 --> 02:18:48.243
<v Hou, Eric>is the same or similar.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12834-0
02:18:48.933 --> 02:18:51.413
<v Hou, Eric>Well, 90% similar to gradient descent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12864-0
02:18:52.093 --> 02:18:58.766
<v Hou, Eric>And then if you just want to know the
core idea of about propagation,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12864-1
02:18:58.766 --> 02:19:05.533
<v Hou, Eric>you actually found the back propagation
is a fancy name of chain rule.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12878-0
02:19:05.653 --> 02:19:11.582
<v Hou, Eric>So then eventually we're just applying
chain rule here in the back propagation</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12878-1
02:19:11.582 --> 02:19:14.133
<v Hou, Eric>of the neural network step, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12882-0
02:19:14.173 --> 02:19:16.093
<v Hou, Eric>So then the neural network is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12893-0
02:19:16.893 --> 02:19:21.453
<v Hou, Eric>Not super new or novel for this machine
learning recipe.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12900-0
02:19:22.243 --> 02:19:24.803
<v Hou, Eric>We're just adding two new flavors.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12908-0
02:19:24.843 --> 02:19:29.483
<v Hou, Eric>One is we add new network as a new
decision function.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12927-0
02:19:29.723 --> 02:19:38.463
<v Hou, Eric>#2 is we're introducing A11 new
optimization method that is called back</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12927-1
02:19:38.463 --> 02:19:40.283
<v Hou, Eric>propagation OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12934-0
02:19:40.443 --> 02:19:43.963
<v Hou, Eric>That's the only thing new in the neural
network.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12943-0
02:19:45.533 --> 02:19:48.293
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
the main loss functions as what I said.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12948-0
02:19:48.293 --> 02:19:51.413
<v Hou, Eric>We're using the main the mean squared
error.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12957-0
02:19:51.763 --> 02:19:55.963
<v Hou, Eric>Which is MSE for regression problem.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12960-0
02:19:56.003 --> 02:19:57.043
<v Hou, Eric>What is that?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12969-0
02:19:57.243 --> 02:20:03.763
<v Hou, Eric>That is our prediction as ay hat our
actual value of Y.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12989-0
02:20:03.763 --> 02:20:09.605
<v Hou, Eric>I want to compare the difference between
my actual value and my prediction my</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12989-1
02:20:09.605 --> 02:20:10.803
<v Hou, Eric>predicted value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12993-0
02:20:11.243 --> 02:20:12.683
<v Hou, Eric>I calculate the difference.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/12998-0
02:20:12.883 --> 02:20:14.083
<v Hou, Eric>I square the difference.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13001-0
02:20:14.163 --> 02:20:16.003
<v Hou, Eric>I summon the mob and take the average.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13009-0
02:20:16.813 --> 02:20:20.893
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of the time we know our sample size.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13016-0
02:20:21.243 --> 02:20:24.683
<v Hou, Eric>Is the same meaning this little N is the
same.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13025-0
02:20:24.723 --> 02:20:28.843
<v Hou, Eric>So we can just ignore this one over a 1 /
N this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13051-0
02:20:29.323 --> 02:20:36.835
<v Hou, Eric>Taking average P step so that we can save
a lot of computation power so that we</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13051-1
02:20:36.835 --> 02:20:40.403
<v Hou, Eric>just sum up all the square difference.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13064-0
02:20:40.443 --> 02:20:46.323
<v Hou, Eric>So this is not necessarily MSE,
it will be the sum of the square errors.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13088-0
02:20:46.523 --> 02:20:51.015
<v Hou, Eric>So then when we talk about MSE,
I may actually refer to SSE,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13088-1
02:20:51.015 --> 02:20:56.611
<v Hou, Eric>which is sum of a square errors because
we are always dealing with the same</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13088-2
02:20:56.611 --> 02:20:58.083
<v Hou, Eric>sample size. So MSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13099-0
02:20:58.403 --> 02:21:02.267
<v Hou, Eric>And SSE,
they have a different value and only</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13099-1
02:21:02.267 --> 02:21:03.443
<v Hou, Eric>difference is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13111-0
02:21:03.563 --> 02:21:08.283
<v Hou, Eric>The wine has taken the average of msse.
Another one is not taking average so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13114-0
02:21:09.813 --> 02:21:11.333
<v Hou, Eric>Conceptually, they are the same.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13135-0
02:21:13.013 --> 02:21:18.020
<v Hou, Eric>For classification we are using is cross
entropy function where the cross entropy</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13135-1
02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:18.813
<v Hou, Eric>is like this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13142-0
02:21:19.053 --> 02:21:23.133
<v Hou, Eric>So the TI is one of the two values.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13160-0
02:21:23.173 --> 02:21:27.569
<v Hou, Eric>It's either zero or one if this TI equal
to one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13160-1
02:21:27.569 --> 02:21:32.413
<v Hou, Eric>I just want to know the probability of
this TI being.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13171-0
02:21:34.003 --> 02:21:38.083
<v Hou, Eric>If TI is actually zero,
I want to know the probability of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13192-0
02:21:38.163 --> 02:21:45.413
<v Hou, Eric>This ti being zero and I want to know my
Y you multiply the logarithm of my</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13192-1
02:21:45.413 --> 02:21:48.083
<v Hou, Eric>probability and sum them up.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13215-0
02:21:48.083 --> 02:21:53.087
<v Hou, Eric>This is the entropy function definition.
I will definitely use that for</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13215-1
02:21:53.087 --> 02:21:58.161
<v Hou, Eric>classification problem and this is going
to be my main loss function for</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13215-2
02:21:58.161 --> 02:21:59.203
<v Hou, Eric>classification.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13218-0
02:22:00.693 --> 02:22:00.893
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13228-0
02:22:01.053 --> 02:22:07.333
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we literally just use those
two different loss functions.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13238-0
02:22:08.003 --> 02:22:11.643
<v Hou, Eric>One is for regression,
another one for classification.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13243-0
02:22:13.213 --> 02:22:13.373
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13250-0
02:22:13.373 --> 02:22:16.355
<v Hou, Eric>And then eventually,
we're gonna show the classification in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13250-1
02:22:16.355 --> 02:22:16.653
<v Hou, Eric>those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13255-0
02:22:18.253 --> 02:22:19.533
<v Hou, Eric>Tables that we are familiar with.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13266-0
02:22:21.293 --> 02:22:25.653
<v Hou, Eric>The the confusion matrix the the
precision, recall, F1 scores.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13270-0
02:22:27.333 --> 02:22:27.773
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13278-0
02:22:27.933 --> 02:22:31.733
<v Hou, Eric>Next one is the gradient descent, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13293-0
02:22:31.733 --> 02:22:38.355
<v Hou, Eric>So the gradient descent is. Is this so?
It's an optimization algorithm and we</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13293-1
02:22:38.355 --> 02:22:40.053
<v Hou, Eric>gonna find the best.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13302-0
02:22:41.653 --> 02:22:43.213
<v Hou, Eric>Parameters that minimize SSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13313-0
02:22:44.763 --> 02:22:49.803
<v Hou, Eric>So now let me show you the first ever
Excel example.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13315-0
02:22:58.733 --> 02:22:58.933
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13336-0
02:23:27.843 --> 02:23:32.863
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I already view this one,
but I can just definitely view this in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13336-1
02:23:32.863 --> 02:23:35.003
<v Hou, Eric>real time so that we can see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13346-0
02:23:35.163 --> 02:23:37.723
<v Hou, Eric>I can show you guys how I actually build
it, OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13354-0
02:23:38.163 --> 02:23:41.643
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just copy paste the sum of data
so now I don't have to build.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13361-0
02:23:43.693 --> 02:23:45.453
<v Hou, Eric>I don't have to redo it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13362-0
02:23:45.493 --> 02:23:47.173
<v Hou, Eric>So here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13364-0
02:23:49.853 --> 02:23:49.933
<v Hou, Eric>Is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13366-0
02:23:50.903 --> 02:23:51.983
<v Hou, Eric>To make it bigger.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13368-0
02:23:53.533 --> 02:23:53.893
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13381-0
02:23:55.413 --> 02:24:01.373
<v Hou, Eric>Let's pretend I know the function that is
ay equals 7 + 3 X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13420-0
02:24:03.093 --> 02:24:07.364
<v Hou, Eric>In this sense,
I will add some noise to here because I</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13420-1
02:24:07.364 --> 02:24:13.731
<v Hou, Eric>do want to make this problem challenging
so that I really do not want to say hey,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13420-2
02:24:13.731 --> 02:24:16.293
<v Hou, Eric>I literally know this is 7 + 3 X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13437-0
02:24:17.043 --> 02:24:25.883
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will say here, here are my apps.
As you can see from .1 to 1.5.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13448-0
02:24:27.373 --> 02:24:30.733
<v Hou, Eric>And my noise is a random number.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13452-0
02:24:30.773 --> 02:24:35.813
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply the magnitude of of this noise.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13466-0
02:24:35.853 --> 02:24:39.708
<v Hou, Eric>So then there will be the random number
multip 19 which is this .</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13466-1
02:24:39.708 --> 02:24:41.693
<v Hou, Eric>1 as a parameter I'm setting here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13477-0
02:24:42.813 --> 02:24:45.173
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then this one,
I can say this is a .2.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13483-0
02:24:45.173 --> 02:24:47.013
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just try .2. That's totally fine.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13502-0
02:24:48.693 --> 02:24:56.093
<v Hou, Eric>So then my Y is 7 + 3 multiplied by my X
and then plus my noise.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13525-0
02:24:56.373 --> 02:25:04.198
<v Hou, Eric>I have this Yi want to know how can I
just go from this ax to this Y without</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13525-1
02:25:04.198 --> 02:25:07.653
<v Hou, Eric>using the linear regression model.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13530-0
02:25:10.143 --> 02:25:11.343
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13537-0
02:25:11.343 --> 02:25:12.943
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say I know this is a.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13543-0
02:25:13.023 --> 02:25:16.423
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say I I do know this is a linear.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13550-0
02:25:17.933 --> 02:25:19.493
<v Hou, Eric>Linear model I will be using.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13563-0
02:25:19.493 --> 02:25:25.373
<v Hou, Eric>So the next say I have AMB.
Let's say I try A to B0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13565-0
02:25:25.373 --> 02:25:26.773
<v Hou, Eric>I try B to be 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13568-0
02:25:28.573 --> 02:25:28.733
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13574-0
02:25:28.733 --> 02:25:33.453
<v Hou, Eric>So then I set up like two initial values.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13578-0
02:25:38.673 --> 02:25:40.853
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, this color that's over right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13580-0
02:25:41.123 --> 02:25:42.163
<v Hou, Eric>We use a different color.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13587-0
02:25:43.693 --> 02:25:45.773
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say I have two initial values,
A and B.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13593-0
02:25:47.803 --> 02:25:49.803
<v Hou, Eric>OK, those, those are the value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13598-0
02:25:49.803 --> 02:25:51.123
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just guessing right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13606-0
02:25:51.123 --> 02:25:55.323
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can have my Y hat uh to be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13609-0
02:25:56.853 --> 02:25:56.973
<v Hou, Eric>My X.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13623-0
02:25:58.973 --> 02:26:03.373
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply by a by initial guess of A plus
my B.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13625-0
02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:06.733
<v Hou, Eric>That'll be my initial guess of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13627-0
02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:09.613
<v Hou, Eric>Of.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13636-0
02:26:12.653 --> 02:26:14.613
<v Hou, Eric>Of my prediction.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13641-0
02:26:14.773 --> 02:26:17.573
<v Hou, Eric>So then I set him as constant.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13648-0
02:26:17.573 --> 02:26:20.293
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can copy and paste in here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13650-0
02:26:21.583 --> 02:26:21.663
<v Hou, Eric>Oh.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13652-0
02:26:28.463 --> 02:26:29.303
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, here we go.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13654-0
02:26:30.863 --> 02:26:31.183
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13674-0
02:26:32.653 --> 02:26:37.485
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see, right?
So now I'm guessing my intercept as a</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13674-1
02:26:37.485 --> 02:26:40.573
<v Hou, Eric>zero and my slope as zero as say slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13676-0
02:26:42.293 --> 02:26:42.813
<v Hou, Eric>Intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13718-0
02:26:44.493 --> 02:26:47.867
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then my Y hat are zeroes.
Now as you can see,</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13718-1
02:26:47.867 --> 02:26:52.806
<v Hou, Eric>whenever I I copy paste do something the
value changes because this random number</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13718-2
02:26:52.806 --> 02:26:57.444
<v Hou, Eric>generator is always changing numbers.
I don't want to make it static so then</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13718-3
02:26:57.444 --> 02:26:59.733
<v Hou, Eric>just bear with me if you do see those.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13721-0
02:26:59.733 --> 02:27:00.413
<v Hou, Eric>Yy values change.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13731-0
02:27:01.583 --> 02:27:04.543
<v Hou, Eric>So my Y hat are all zeroes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13771-0
02:27:04.543 --> 02:27:11.735
<v Hou, Eric>This is a. This is not a great prediction,
but I can still calculate error where the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13771-1
02:27:11.735 --> 02:27:17.235
<v Hou, Eric>error is my Y my actual Y minus my Y hat
which is my prediction.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13771-2
02:27:17.235 --> 02:27:24.173
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see this is not a great error
because I have all the errors super big.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13780-0
02:27:25.813 --> 02:27:30.373
<v Hou, Eric>Right, so now I can try an error squared.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13785-0
02:27:30.813 --> 02:27:32.133
<v Hou, Eric>So my error squared.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13789-0
02:27:32.133 --> 02:27:34.613
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just basically squared out.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13792-0
02:27:34.923 --> 02:27:36.123
<v Hou, Eric>Those errors.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13799-0
02:27:38.583 --> 02:27:40.343
<v Hou, Eric>Here are my what?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13800-0
02:27:40.343 --> 02:27:42.183
<v Hou, Eric>I have OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13813-0
02:27:42.543 --> 02:27:47.423
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm going to calculate this
average where the average is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13826-0
02:27:47.463 --> 02:27:52.848
<v Hou, Eric>You know your you guys are familiar with
the Excel function average of all the</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13826-1
02:27:52.848 --> 02:27:54.143
<v Hou, Eric>errors squared. OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13828-0
02:27:54.583 --> 02:27:56.143
<v Hou, Eric>What is this average?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13835-0
02:27:58.803 --> 02:28:01.083
<v Hou, Eric>Do you recall what this average is?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13841-0
02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:05.733
<v Hou, Eric>Remember this error square is my.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13875-0
02:28:07.413 --> 02:28:15.891
<v Hou, Eric>Error squared and my error is my column C
minus my column I and that is my actual Y</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13875-1
02:28:15.891 --> 02:28:20.533
<v Hou, Eric>minus my prediction of Y and take an
average.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13880-0
02:28:20.533 --> 02:28:23.333
<v Hou, Eric>What is the average if you guys remember?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13882-0
02:28:31.633 --> 02:28:33.273
<v Hou, Eric>So that is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13884-0
02:28:35.213 --> 02:28:35.933
<v Hou, Eric>Our famous.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13892-0
02:28:37.973 --> 02:28:38.533
<v Hou, Eric>Our metric MSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13914-0
02:28:39.173 --> 02:28:45.919
<v Hou, Eric>So MSE is I'm taking the average between
my actual values and my prediction and</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13914-1
02:28:45.919 --> 02:28:50.893
<v Hou, Eric>I'm taking a square and that different
square and that is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13918-0
02:28:52.893 --> 02:28:53.333
<v Hou, Eric>Exactly what?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13928-0
02:28:53.333 --> 02:28:58.973
<v Hou, Eric>I'm calculating here so this is not a
regular average, this is MSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13943-0
02:29:04.023 --> 02:29:11.743
<v Hou, Eric>So I will have this table prepared and I
have my MSE here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13946-0
02:29:12.923 --> 02:29:13.563
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13951-0
02:29:13.763 --> 02:29:17.723
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try one more thing. Sorry.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13961-0
02:29:20.993 --> 02:29:24.513
<v Hou, Eric>A beauty stable on on windows and right
now I'm using umm.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13963-0
02:29:26.523 --> 02:29:26.963
<v Hou, Eric>Mac.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13970-0
02:29:28.653 --> 02:29:29.453
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try one more thing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13981-0
02:29:29.453 --> 02:29:34.813
<v Hou, Eric>Let's change the slope to .
5 instead of a 00.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13986-0
02:29:35.013 --> 02:29:37.533
<v Hou, Eric>So then we will have a different.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/13991-0
02:29:39.333 --> 02:29:40.453
<v Hou, Eric>Set of Y hat.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14005-0
02:29:40.853 --> 02:29:47.253
<v Hou, Eric>There will be this X multiplying this
slope and plus this intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14012-0
02:29:49.093 --> 02:29:51.893
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can make those constant.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14016-0
02:29:53.913 --> 02:29:54.313
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14022-0
02:29:54.313 --> 02:29:56.913
<v Hou, Eric>I have this .05 here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14030-0
02:29:56.913 --> 02:29:59.753
<v Hou, Eric>That's a correct and I can recall it.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14052-0
02:29:59.753 --> 02:30:07.583
<v Hou, Eric>My error that'll be this Y minus this.
I have this value so now I can calculate.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14052-1
02:30:07.583 --> 02:30:12.513
<v Hou, Eric>I can do this calculation for all of
those values.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14060-0
02:30:13.853 --> 02:30:16.173
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see, I have a new MSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14064-0
02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.683
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try another thing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14076-0
02:30:22.573 --> 02:30:28.213
<v Hou, Eric>Let's get the slope equal to 0 and
intercept equal to 05.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14084-0
02:30:29.853 --> 02:30:31.213
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm still doing the trick.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14087-0
02:30:31.573 --> 02:30:33.293
<v Hou, Eric>Help help you guys can see.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14109-0
02:30:35.013 --> 02:30:40.460
<v Hou, Eric>I recalculate to be this X multiply this
slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14109-1
02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:46.133
<v Hou, Eric>Plus this is intercept and make them as
constant.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14116-0
02:30:48.923 --> 02:30:51.723
<v Hou, Eric>Static and I recalculate my error.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14123-0
02:30:54.773 --> 02:30:56.373
<v Hou, Eric>Minus is Y hat.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14126-0
02:30:57.373 --> 02:30:59.173
<v Hou, Eric>I still have this error squared.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14128-0
02:31:01.433 --> 02:31:01.993
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14133-0
02:31:05.533 --> 02:31:08.653
<v Hou, Eric>I see my MSE again.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14139-0
02:31:09.803 --> 02:31:12.323
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14160-0
02:31:12.803 --> 02:31:23.348
<v Hou, Eric>I change my slope from 02.5.
I got my MSE from this imperfect 92 to</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14160-1
02:31:23.348 --> 02:31:24.123
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14164-0
02:31:24.123 --> 02:31:26.683
<v Hou, Eric>Still imperfect, but better 84.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14166-0
02:31:29.053 --> 02:31:29.253
<v Hou, Eric>Right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14176-0
02:31:29.773 --> 02:31:34.533
<v Hou, Eric>So if I could calculate the change of MSE.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14186-0
02:31:39.493 --> 02:31:44.653
<v Hou, Eric>Divide by change of slope, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14191-0
02:31:45.013 --> 02:31:46.133
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can do this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14192-0
02:31:46.133 --> 02:31:47.013
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do that.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14196-0
02:31:47.133 --> 02:31:49.133
<v Hou, Eric>The change of MSE is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14200-0
02:31:50.653 --> 02:31:52.493
<v Hou, Eric>This minus this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14211-0
02:31:54.053 --> 02:31:59.093
<v Hou, Eric>And the change of slope is .5 -, 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14226-0
02:32:00.933 --> 02:32:09.653
<v Hou, Eric>So I have this change of MSE divided by
change of slope number -15.87.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14233-0
02:32:10.043 --> 02:32:13.003
<v Hou, Eric>7/3 I have AI have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14238-0
02:32:13.003 --> 02:32:14.323
<v Hou, Eric>AI have AI have a big number.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14241-0
02:32:14.363 --> 02:32:16.363
<v Hou, Eric>It's an active number, OK?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14243-0
02:32:17.893 --> 02:32:18.053
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14263-0
02:32:19.813 --> 02:32:26.813
<v Hou, Eric>First question I calculated as change of
MSE divided by the change of slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14269-0
02:32:29.163 --> 02:32:33.123
<v Hou, Eric>Does this ratio remind you something?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14280-0
02:32:35.763 --> 02:32:40.083
<v Hou, Eric>What does change of MSE?
Divide by change of slope mean?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14295-0
02:32:55.453 --> 02:33:01.213
<v Hou, Eric>So if you guys recall the the concept of
derivative right, so.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14299-0
02:33:03.013 --> 02:33:03.653
<v Hou, Eric>This let me just.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14309-0
02:33:05.533 --> 02:33:10.493
<v Hou, Eric>Merge these change of MSE versus change
of a slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14315-0
02:33:10.973 --> 02:33:14.173
<v Hou, Eric>This one is really the derivative.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14321-0
02:33:16.783 --> 02:33:21.263
<v Hou, Eric>Of Mic with respect to slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14344-0
02:33:22.733 --> 02:33:26.093
<v Hou, Eric>That's the same concept,
and this value is -15.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14344-1
02:33:26.093 --> 02:33:31.623
<v Hou, Eric>91 and then the reason you change the
value just because my random number kept</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14344-2
02:33:31.623 --> 02:33:32.253
<v Hou, Eric>changing.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14356-0
02:33:34.693 --> 02:33:40.024
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
And number two question is we change this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14356-1
02:33:40.024 --> 02:33:42.573
<v Hou, Eric>slope from zero to .5?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14362-0
02:33:43.763 --> 02:33:45.163
<v Hou, Eric>To .5 right.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14363-0
02:33:45.323 --> 02:33:46.883
<v Hou, Eric>So that we got.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14374-0
02:33:48.373 --> 02:33:54.173
<v Hou, Eric>Mse smaller and we got a derivative,
a minus number.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14388-0
02:33:54.413 --> 02:34:00.773
<v Hou, Eric>So then if I change slope from .0 to .
5 I got MSE smaller.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14398-0
02:34:01.173 --> 02:34:05.533
<v Hou, Eric>Can you guys tell me should I try the
next slope?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14403-0
02:34:05.533 --> 02:34:08.133
<v Hou, Eric>Bigger than .5 or smaller than .5.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14406-0
02:34:11.953 --> 02:34:12.593
<v Severin, Noah>Bigger.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14439-0
02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:22.183
<v Hou, Eric>Bigger, that's a great observation.
We should try a new slope bigger than .</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14439-1
02:34:22.183 --> 02:34:31.423
<v Hou, Eric>5 S if we want to try a number bigger
than .5 S, then that is the opposite.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14449-0
02:34:32.693 --> 02:34:37.813
<v Hou, Eric>Direction to the slope because we want to.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14457-0
02:34:38.093 --> 02:34:41.253
<v Hou, Eric>Our slope is telling us a negative number.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14458-0
02:34:41.293 --> 02:34:43.253
<v Hou, Eric>However, we will try.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14460-0
02:34:44.703 --> 02:34:44.783
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14465-0
02:34:44.863 --> 02:34:45.423
<v Hou, Eric>A bigger number.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14489-0
02:34:45.423 --> 02:34:52.521
<v Hou, Eric>So then the the next step we will be
trying some slope that is to the opposite</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14489-1
02:34:52.521 --> 02:34:57.103
<v Hou, Eric>direction that this this directive is
pointing to.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14496-0
02:34:57.383 --> 02:35:02.583
<v Hou, Eric>So if the director is telling negative,
we gonna add some value to this slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14514-0
02:35:03.543 --> 02:35:07.329
<v Hou, Eric>However,
in some cases you see these derivatives</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14514-1
02:35:07.329 --> 02:35:11.423
<v Hou, Eric>are positive.
Now means you want to lower the slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14531-0
02:35:11.423 --> 02:35:17.543
<v Hou, Eric>We always go the opposite direction to
the derivative MSE with this with respect</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14531-1
02:35:17.543 --> 02:35:18.223
<v Hou, Eric>to slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14537-0
02:35:19.703 --> 02:35:22.783
<v Hou, Eric>Similarly, we can calculate.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14544-0
02:35:24.543 --> 02:35:28.623
<v Hou, Eric>The change of MSE with respect to
intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14559-0
02:35:30.793 --> 02:35:37.033
<v Hou, Eric>Where exactly the same way that is,
we only changed intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14575-0
02:35:37.673 --> 02:35:49.113
<v Hou, Eric>I have the the new MSE minus the original
MSE divided by my new INTERCEPT minus.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14579-0
02:35:50.503 --> 02:35:51.223
<v Hou, Eric>The older intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14585-0
02:35:52.613 --> 02:35:55.973
<v Hou, Eric>I have a different derivative.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14591-0
02:35:57.823 --> 02:36:00.303
<v Hou, Eric>And this one is derivative.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14602-0
02:36:02.423 --> 02:36:09.463
<v Hou, Eric>Of MSE with respect with respect to
intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14609-0
02:36:11.853 --> 02:36:14.093
<v Hou, Eric>And similarly to the slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14632-0
02:36:15.413 --> 02:36:21.056
<v Hou, Eric>Similar to slope,
we know we raised the intercept from zero</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14632-1
02:36:21.056 --> 02:36:24.253
<v Hou, Eric>to .5, keeping the slope the same.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14648-0
02:36:24.253 --> 02:36:34.853
<v Hou, Eric>We have MSE smaller from 91.8 to 92.
6 so that we should always we should try.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14650-0
02:36:37.393 --> 02:36:38.593
<v Hou, Eric>A bigger.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14652-0
02:36:40.013 --> 02:36:40.893
<v Hou, Eric>Intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14659-0
02:36:42.503 --> 02:36:43.623
<v Hou, Eric>Which is also the opposite.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14670-0
02:36:46.363 --> 02:36:54.443
<v Hou, Eric>Direction to the derivative to to the
derivative with respect to.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14673-0
02:36:56.703 --> 02:36:57.663
<v Hou, Eric>Inters app.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14677-0
02:37:13.293 --> 02:37:13.453
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14709-0
02:37:14.753 --> 02:37:23.064
<v Hou, Eric>So now you may be wondering what is LR is
what this LR mean this LR means learning</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14709-1
02:37:23.064 --> 02:37:28.270
<v Hou, Eric>rate OK .1.
The reason we said this learning rate .</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14709-2
02:37:28.270 --> 02:37:31.073
<v Hou, Eric>1 you can say is smaller is.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14720-0
02:37:33.063 --> 02:37:37.143
<v Hou, Eric>This derivative and those two values are
actually called gradient.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14732-0
02:37:41.353 --> 02:37:44.873
<v Hou, Eric>Is a gradient, is a one of a gradients,
another one of the gradient.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14739-0
02:37:47.693 --> 02:37:49.733
<v Hou, Eric>And the gradient. Oh gosh, I just.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14758-0
02:37:52.293 --> 02:37:55.434
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then we we can definitely add this</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14758-1
02:37:55.434 --> 02:37:59.133
<v Hou, Eric>gradient back,
but we'd better just go step by step.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14761-0
02:37:59.133 --> 02:38:00.613
<v Hou, Eric>That's why I have this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14766-0
02:38:00.613 --> 02:38:02.333
<v Hou, Eric>I have a learning rate in here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14779-0
02:38:03.863 --> 02:38:07.303
<v Hou, Eric>What we're going to do is let's just copy
paste everything here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14785-0
02:38:12.313 --> 02:38:13.353
<v Hou, Eric>And we're gonna adjust.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14787-0
02:38:13.713 --> 02:38:15.593
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm going to.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14799-0
02:38:18.063 --> 02:38:21.943
<v Hou, Eric>App update the slow by intercept by doing
this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14801-0
02:38:21.943 --> 02:38:24.823
<v Hou, Eric>This equals this value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14803-0
02:38:26.583 --> 02:38:26.783
<v Hou, Eric>Minus.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14812-0
02:38:29.513 --> 02:38:35.313
<v Hou, Eric>The gradient for slope multiply my
learning rate.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14820-0
02:38:38.493 --> 02:38:44.293
<v Hou, Eric>And this one going to be my previous
intercept minus.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14828-0
02:38:45.703 --> 02:38:49.983
<v Hou, Eric>My gradient for intercept multiply my
learning rate.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14831-0
02:38:52.913 --> 02:38:53.473
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14853-0
02:38:53.633 --> 02:39:01.942
<v Hou, Eric>I have those values and then I gonna
recalculate the Y hat where Y hat is my .</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14853-1
02:39:01.942 --> 02:39:05.833
<v Hou, Eric>1. Multiply this slope the new slope.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14857-0
02:39:08.053 --> 02:39:11.013
<v Hou, Eric>Plus my new intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14866-0
02:39:14.253 --> 02:39:18.533
<v Hou, Eric>And my era is going to be my old.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14872-0
02:39:20.463 --> 02:39:21.983
<v Hou, Eric>Y minus my new Y hat.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14879-0
02:39:23.783 --> 02:39:25.223
<v Hou, Eric>And L square is the same.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14885-0
02:39:25.223 --> 02:39:28.743
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just refresh this table.
I'm sorry.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14895-0
02:39:33.983 --> 02:39:39.503
<v Hou, Eric>Boom, I reduced MSE from 92 to 41.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14898-0
02:39:39.783 --> 02:39:41.623
<v Hou, Eric>So now let's do this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14903-0
02:39:43.383 --> 02:39:44.263
<v Hou, Eric>Let's still calculate.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14927-0
02:39:45.983 --> 02:39:52.122
<v Hou, Eric>My my gradient by adding .
5 here and keep the intercept the same as</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14927-1
02:39:52.122 --> 02:39:57.103
<v Hou, Eric>before so that I will quickly calculate
the Y hat this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14930-0
02:39:58.783 --> 02:40:00.943
<v Hou, Eric>This plus this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14933-0
02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:04.133
<v Hou, Eric>I'll get nurse.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14939-0
02:40:07.383 --> 02:40:12.703
<v Hou, Eric>OK, my era this minus, yes.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14941-0
02:40:18.883 --> 02:40:19.203
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14955-0
02:40:20.903 --> 02:40:26.423
<v Hou, Eric>I got my God.
My MSE is smaller and this one I keep.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14961-0
02:40:26.423 --> 02:40:28.943
<v Hou, Eric>I I will keep the slope the same.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14968-0
02:40:29.263 --> 02:40:32.103
<v Hou, Eric>I'll add a .5 to this intercept.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14976-0
02:40:34.703 --> 02:40:36.503
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I let me recalculate the Y hat.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14980-0
02:40:51.953 --> 02:40:53.073
<v Hou, Eric>I recall that error.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14986-0
02:40:58.223 --> 02:40:59.863
<v Hou, Eric>Cool off this.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/14990-0
02:41:03.833 --> 02:41:04.393
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15003-0
02:41:04.633 --> 02:41:11.725
<v Hou, Eric>I have another new gradient OK,
but as you can see all the mses are</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15003-1
02:41:11.725 --> 02:41:13.393
<v Hou, Eric>getting smaller.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15009-0
02:41:13.433 --> 02:41:15.913
<v Hou, Eric>We are getting there and then we have a
new.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15029-0
02:41:17.503 --> 02:41:21.750
<v Hou, Eric>Set of gradients and as you can see the
gradients is actually getting a smaller</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15029-1
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:23.183
<v Hou, Eric>in terms of absolute value.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15035-0
02:41:23.183 --> 02:41:25.743
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just do one more step and then
we'll stop.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15041-0
02:41:27.093 --> 02:41:28.773
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just copy.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15049-0
02:41:30.273 --> 02:41:33.633
<v Hou, Eric>And and start and paste it here.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15061-0
02:41:33.873 --> 02:41:41.028
<v Hou, Eric>So this value will be this M2 minus this
number multiplied this. OK perfect.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15061-1
02:41:41.028 --> 02:41:42.793
<v Hou, Eric>This Y hat will be.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15063-0
02:41:45.343 --> 02:41:45.383
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15065-0
02:41:46.733 --> 02:41:48.893
<v Hou, Eric>T&amp;U.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15070-0
02:41:50.623 --> 02:41:53.183
<v Hou, Eric>It's error will be C.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15085-0
02:41:58.843 --> 02:42:05.243
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see, if I just ignore this,
the those gradient steps, right?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15101-0
02:42:06.703 --> 02:42:14.303
<v Hou, Eric>So we are moving from 92 initial guess 00
and 92 MSE to 18.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15106-0
02:42:15.983 --> 02:42:18.023
<v Hou, Eric>So this stops.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15112-0
02:42:20.663 --> 02:42:21.623
<v Hou, Eric>And if I may say.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15120-0
02:42:25.433 --> 02:42:27.233
<v Hou, Eric>Sure. Is that intrinsic?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15125-0
02:42:27.673 --> 02:42:31.713
<v Hou, Eric>So this is step one or step 0.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15129-0
02:42:35.023 --> 02:42:36.343
<v Hou, Eric>This is step one.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15131-0
02:42:40.553 --> 02:42:41.473
<v Hou, Eric>This step too.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15137-0
02:42:43.063 --> 02:42:44.023
<v Hou, Eric>And you keep going.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15141-0
02:42:44.023 --> 02:42:45.063
<v Hou, Eric>You have Step 3.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15164-0
02:42:45.063 --> 02:42:48.566
<v Hou, Eric>Step 4.
You will have this MSE getting smaller</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15164-1
02:42:48.566 --> 02:42:51.920
<v Hou, Eric>and smaller.
This gradient is going to stop.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15164-2
02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:55.423
<v Hou, Eric>Those stepwise is getting smaller and
smaller.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15184-0
02:42:55.423 --> 02:43:02.634
<v Hou, Eric>You eventually have those slow and
intersect close to this seven and three.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15184-1
02:43:02.634 --> 02:43:06.903
<v Hou, Eric>In the end,
this is the process of gradient.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15186-0
02:43:08.063 --> 02:43:08.303
<v Hou, Eric>Descent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15217-0
02:43:08.973 --> 02:43:15.346
<v Hou, Eric>OK, in, in, in computer science,
we just have all those Staffs coded in</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15217-1
02:43:15.346 --> 02:43:22.869
<v Hou, Eric>Python so that you can just directly call.
So this is the the Excel demonstration of</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15217-2
02:43:22.869 --> 02:43:24.373
<v Hou, Eric>gradient descent.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15220-0
02:43:26.143 --> 02:43:27.143
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15236-0
02:43:37.023 --> 02:43:39.783
<v Hou, Eric>OK, if you don't have any questions,
I hope you have.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15237-0
02:43:39.783 --> 02:43:41.223
<v Hou, Eric>Enjoy the week.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15244-0
02:43:41.343 --> 02:43:44.423
<v Hou, Eric>I'll let you guys know the homework and
then we'll meet next week.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15254-0
02:43:46.793 --> 02:43:47.433

02:43:47.883 --> 02:43:48.283
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

cc4d3ee7-656d-433f-a6c0-feb7200ff15f/15260-0
