00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:08.928
<v Hou, Eric>Recording started perfect.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/30-0
00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:13.928
<v Hou, Eric>So last time we talked about, you know,
the the tree model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/40-0
00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.888
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just quickly review what we just
covered, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/46-0
00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:20.368
<v Hou, Eric>So then make sure we're on the same page.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/56-0
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.464
<v Hou, Eric>So tree model,
we talk about classification and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/56-1
00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:26.688
<v Hou, Eric>regression trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/69-0
00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:33.808
<v Hou, Eric>So tree model As for model is quite I
would say straightforward.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/73-0
00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.928
<v Hou, Eric>The reason why I'm saying straightforward
is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/86-0
00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:40.318
<v Hou, Eric>As you know,
we are using as a human being, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/92-0
00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:43.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then we use tree models.
Pretty much every single day.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/113-0
00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:48.545
<v Hou, Eric>How we make decisions for our lives and
how we make decisions for the business,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/113-1
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:52.278
<v Hou, Eric>we actually utilize the tree model,
knowingly or not knowingly.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/116-0
00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:54.768
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/129-0
00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:58.003
<v Hou, Eric>How we use a tree model,
we really use a tree model for two</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/129-1
00:00:58.003 --> 00:00:58.488
<v Hou, Eric>purposes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/135-0
00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:00.088
<v Hou, Eric>One is called classification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/143-0
00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:04.968
<v Hou, Eric>We want to predict the yes or no or
category 123.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/146-0
00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:07.568
<v Hou, Eric>That kind of question.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/153-0
00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:10.788
<v Hou, Eric>Should we go forward with this business
plan?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/154-0
00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:11.508
<v Hou, Eric>Should we just?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/169-0
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:15.519
<v Hou, Eric>Should we just? No, go,
go or no go decision making.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/169-1
00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.908
<v Hou, Eric>So those kind of the classification trees
we're building.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/173-0
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.328
<v Hou, Eric>Regression trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/179-0
00:01:22.328 --> 00:01:22.928
<v Hou, Eric>We're rebuilding.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/194-0
00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:26.888
<v Hou, Eric>For example, hey,
we have several folks in the same level</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/194-1
00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:29.288
<v Hou, Eric>and then they have a similar experience.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/205-0
00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:33.848
<v Hou, Eric>Should they have the same salary and the
salary has a continuous value?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/212-0
00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:37.048
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of dollars?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/217-0
00:01:37.048 --> 00:01:39.528
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is sort of like we are using
decision trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/244-0
00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:45.603
<v Hou, Eric>To judge by the the experience that
person have the degree that person has to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/244-1
00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:50.558
<v Hou, Eric>give a fair amount of dollars as a
payment to to the person, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/256-0
00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:56.238
<v Hou, Eric>So then there's one example that we are
building regression trees in finance.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/274-0
00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:00.878
<v Hou, Eric>So credit score,
you can consider this as a high, low,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/274-1
00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:03.758
<v Hou, Eric>medium kind of a class.
If that's the case.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/287-0
00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:07.732
<v Hou, Eric>We are really using classification model.
However,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/287-1
00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:10.008
<v Hou, Eric>we will really give a person credit score.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/295-0
00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:13.878
<v Hou, Eric>877 hundredish.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/301-0
00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:17.878
<v Hou, Eric>So those are really a regression model,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/314-0
00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:22.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then we're also using it for
healthcare decision prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/344-0
00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:28.717
<v Hou, Eric>I was in one project that we are we are
collecting a lot of data to predict</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/344-1
00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:34.552
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not if there's any early
leading indicator of a different kind of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/344-2
00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:35.158
<v Hou, Eric>cancers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/363-0
00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.064
<v Hou, Eric>Right,
so now you know some something happened</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/363-1
00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:41.008
<v Hou, Eric>to your body and then you, you,
you you went to the hospital and.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/376-0
00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:44.638
<v Hou, Eric>And take some pictures and CT or or X-ray.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/397-0
00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:48.717
<v Hou, Eric>So then there are some different features
on the picture,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/397-1
00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:53.598
<v Hou, Eric>so then you can use machine learning to
identify if those are different.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/425-0
00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:59.428
<v Hou, Eric>Strange PCs can lead to some specific
disease and also like you can use machine</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/425-1
00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:03.516
<v Hou, Eric>learning either classification,
regression to do the marketing,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/425-2
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.198
<v Hou, Eric>for example the the customer segmentation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/443-0
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:12.778
<v Hou, Eric>So that's quite common to use emotional
learning on customer segmentation, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/454-0
00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:18.898
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually leverage the the
clustering analysis to sort of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/460-0
00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:22.888
<v Hou, Eric>Partition your customer base into
different groups.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/478-0
00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:29.638
<v Hou, Eric>And and and that's sort of anecdotal
results of of different groups, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/496-0
00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:35.012
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you do have some data that
from your marketing team,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/496-1
00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:38.118
<v Hou, Eric>they know the customer who purchased.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/506-0
00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:41.958
<v Hou, Eric>Products are definitely high value
customers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/525-0
00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:46.761
<v Hou, Eric>They, they,
they they purchase another amount of of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/525-1
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:50.318
<v Hou, Eric>dollars and then that could be a low
value customer groups.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/580-0
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:55.856
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's how you actually putting
the labels to those customers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/580-1
00:03:55.856 --> 00:04:00.828
<v Hou, Eric>Once you have the labels associated
customers and you can actually build a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/580-2
00:04:00.828 --> 00:04:05.867
<v Hou, Eric>machine learning algorithm to learn the
patterns behind the data and how to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/580-3
00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:08.784
<v Hou, Eric>identify a customer,
a high value customer,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/580-4
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.508
<v Hou, Eric>how you identify a custom.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/594-0
00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:14.995
<v Hou, Eric>A low value customer and then you can
design different marketing strategy based</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/594-1
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:15.948
<v Hou, Eric>upon the results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/605-0
00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:18.398
<v Hou, Eric>Just to double check,
I'm sharing these slides.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/607-0
00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:19.278
<v Hou, Eric>Can you guys see it?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/610-0
00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:24.458
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>We can.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/613-0
00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:24.668
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yep, I can see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/617-0
00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:25.238
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Yep.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/615-0
00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:25.778
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/620-0
00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:26.778
<v Hou, Eric>That is good. That's good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/625-0
00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:29.458
<v Hou, Eric>Should have checked this before so then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/638-0
00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:35.968
<v Hou, Eric>Usually people use this method quite
often in in e-commerce channel, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/640-0
00:04:36.248 --> 00:04:39.488
<v Hou, Eric>So quite common usage.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/652-0
00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:45.608
<v Hou, Eric>Is the lifetime value of of a customer
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/659-0
00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:48.928
<v Hou, Eric>So now you can.
You can view the classification model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/678-0
00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:53.072
<v Hou, Eric>As Brady,
we actually had that kind of model and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/678-1
00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:55.408
<v Hou, Eric>then we actually I,
I I led A-Team build up.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/720-0
00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:01.628
<v Hou, Eric>So then based upon their first ever
purchase data, so who they are,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/720-1
00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:05.273
<v Hou, Eric>what they did,
what kind of product did they purchase</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/720-2
00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:10.066
<v Hou, Eric>and how much money they spent on on
Brady's e-commerce channel, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/720-3
00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:14.318
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then you can actually learn
from that. You can you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/734-0
00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:19.993
<v Hou, Eric>Can project it that information into a
two year worth kind of arrange you,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/734-1
00:05:19.993 --> 00:05:20.598
<v Hou, Eric>can you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/740-0
00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:23.318
<v Hou, Eric>Can you can predict if some people?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/743-0
00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:25.008
<v Hou, Eric>Purchased.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/767-0
00:05:25.398 --> 00:05:29.565
<v Hou, Eric>Some subsid products and then they
definitely gonna keep purchasing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/767-1
00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:34.396
<v Hou, Eric>One good example will be for example,
if some customers purchase some printers,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/767-2
00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:34.758
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/783-0
00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:38.565
<v Hou, Eric>So then likeli,
they will keep purchasing the cartridges</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/783-1
00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:42.638
<v Hou, Eric>and paper associate with that to fit in
that printer, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/809-0
00:05:42.638 --> 00:05:46.901
<v Hou, Eric>So then and and if some person purchased
a a computer,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/809-1
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:53.178
<v Hou, Eric>and then maybe that person will purchase
the monitors and then mouse and and the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/809-2
00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:55.038
<v Hou, Eric>keyboard, those kind of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/813-0
00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:56.398
<v Hou, Eric>Product socialism.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/821-0
00:05:56.758 --> 00:05:59.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so really who your product?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/830-0
00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:03.505
<v Hou, Eric>Who your customer is and what they
purchased the first time.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/830-1
00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:04.638
<v Hou, Eric>First engagement.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/844-0
00:06:05.838 --> 00:06:08.598
<v Hou, Eric>And then how much money they just put on
the table?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/858-0
00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:13.975
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the good information and really
strong signal to tell the business</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/858-1
00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:16.838
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not they will keep purchasing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/886-0
00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:21.212
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then some data after that first ever</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/886-1
00:06:21.212 --> 00:06:25.026
<v Hou, Eric>engagement.
So the customer satisfaction score,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/886-2
00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:28.998
<v Hou, Eric>how often they they visit your your your
website?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/898-0
00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:32.358
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the information you can
actually acquire with your marketing team</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/898-1
00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.038
<v Hou, Eric>and then you can build different models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/910-0
00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:37.928
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon that, those those information,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/912-0
00:06:38.368 --> 00:06:40.648
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually leverage.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/924-0
00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:46.648
<v Hou, Eric>The large language models to send them
different personalized.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/937-0
00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:51.700
<v Hou, Eric>Personalized messages there could be
e-mail message.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/937-1
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.468
<v Hou, Eric>It could be a text message.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/950-0
00:06:55.368 --> 00:06:59.728
<v Hou, Eric>Right now I don't see a lot of companies
really changing their their own.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/976-0
00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:06.466
<v Hou, Eric>Web page based upon this this
classification results but in the future</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/976-1
00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:11.168
<v Hou, Eric>I guess it's doable you,
but you can definitely run some AP test.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/986-0
00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:15.968
<v Hou, Eric>To to to analyze the data you receive and
then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1008-0
00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Hou, Eric>To analyze their purchase pattern once
you leverage LLM to send the customer</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1008-1
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.438
<v Hou, Eric>personalized emails or text messages.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1027-0
00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:30.060
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon whether or not those customers
are high value group,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1027-1
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.678
<v Hou, Eric>high value customers or low value
customers, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1035-0
00:07:32.678 --> 00:07:36.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can do a lot of things based
upon this customer segmentation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1039-0
00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:38.788
<v Hou, Eric>More right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1086-0
00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:45.630
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm also in a group with my
friend Building 1 tool to to sort of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1086-1
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:52.847
<v Hou, Eric>automatically analyze 10K10Q data,
and then hopefully we we we thought those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1086-2
00:07:52.847 --> 00:08:00.251
<v Hou, Eric>are really good signal to identify to
identify if some your target company are</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1086-3
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:02.688
<v Hou, Eric>invnding new products not.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1090-0
00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:03.668
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna drive the revenue?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1100-0
00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:07.248
<v Hou, Eric>In the market or or make make them so
different in the market, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1113-0
00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:11.712
<v Hou, Eric>So now we are seeing.
We are hoping to analyze those data and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1113-1
00:08:11.712 --> 00:08:12.118
<v Hou, Eric>those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1130-0
00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:18.427
<v Hou, Eric>10K10Q report, right.
So then they also release a lot of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1130-1
00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:19.568
<v Hou, Eric>business risks.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1170-0
00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:25.697
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then that's some signal you
can analyze from different versions of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1170-1
00:08:25.697 --> 00:08:31.398
<v Hou, Eric>A10Q or different versions of 10K,
and whether or not there isn't any new</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1170-2
00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:37.330
<v Hou, Eric>risk, that company will be facing,
the new risks usually is really an active</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1170-3
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.408
<v Hou, Eric>sign to their.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1194-0
00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:44.730
<v Hou, Eric>Near a stop price and then you can you
can quantify whether or not that</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1194-1
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:50.278
<v Hou, Eric>additional new risk is really driving
that enterprise value down.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1217-0
00:08:50.438 --> 00:08:54.175
<v Hou, Eric>And how much based upon you know the
marketing response.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1217-1
00:08:54.175 --> 00:08:58.436
<v Hou, Eric>So then those kind of information that
are pretty cool analysis,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1217-2
00:08:58.436 --> 00:08:59.878
<v Hou, Eric>you can definitely do.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1251-0
00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:05.425
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then you can just consider
you can build a class,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1251-1
00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:10.349
<v Hou, Eric>you know regression tree to analyze to
those kind of new risks and categorize</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1251-2
00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:14.768
<v Hou, Eric>them and then to to to quantify the
impact to those companies, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1260-0
00:09:14.768 --> 00:09:18.145
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so those are something that good ideas</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1260-1
00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.888
<v Hou, Eric>that you can try in your final project.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1271-0
00:09:21.238 --> 00:09:25.998
<v Hou, Eric>I really received some teams sending me
in that OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1282-0
00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.478
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think this is a good,
reasonable idea?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1318-0
00:09:28.838 --> 00:09:33.628
<v Hou, Eric>So you know I my suggestion is yes,
I understand there are some LLM.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1318-1
00:09:33.628 --> 00:09:37.238
<v Hou, Eric>We were gonna be cover later.
But you know for LLM.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1318-2
00:09:37.238 --> 00:09:41.959
<v Hou, Eric>There is a lot of really good
applications that you can easily find</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1318-3
00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:45.638
<v Hou, Eric>those codes online and if you wanna
leverage LLM so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1327-0
00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:50.208
<v Hou, Eric>In your final projects you you if you
feel the LLM.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1359-0
00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:53.845
<v Hou, Eric>Llm is unnecessary piece of your final
projects.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1359-1
00:09:53.845 --> 00:09:57.625
<v Hou, Eric>I would say just use it and then I will
be more than happy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1359-2
00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:02.917
<v Hou, Eric>You just sign me one one task and say hey
Eric just can you help me code that piece</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1359-3
00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:03.358
<v Hou, Eric>for me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1368-0
00:10:03.718 --> 00:10:05.278
<v Hou, Eric>I'm more than happy to do that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1375-0
00:10:05.348 --> 00:10:08.668
<v Hou, Eric>And then you know, but you have to,
you know, subscribe your API.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1399-0
00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:13.786
<v Hou, Eric>But I'm more than happy to do that so I
can provide you some codes and you can</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1399-1
00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:19.034
<v Hou, Eric>just copy paste and then plug in into
your. Your final projects is totally fine,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1399-2
00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:19.228
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1411-0
00:10:20.798 --> 00:10:24.829
<v Hou, Eric>So card is basically short for
classification regression trees,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1411-1
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:26.278
<v Hou, Eric>and then we definitely.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1414-0
00:10:28.438 --> 00:10:29.318
<v Hou, Eric>Look at like.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1424-0
00:10:34.088 --> 00:10:36.688
<v Hou, Eric>We took a look at one example, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1432-0
00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:42.128
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so how size versus the house price, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1443-0
00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:47.207
<v Hou, Eric>So then we know the the formula behind
seeing how we generate the result.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1443-1
00:10:47.207 --> 00:10:48.168
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1461-0
00:10:51.998 --> 00:10:56.994
<v Hou, Eric>And then we can easily build a first ever
decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1461-1
00:10:56.994 --> 00:10:59.798
<v Hou, Eric>It just as as easy as you split.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1466-0
00:11:01.358 --> 00:11:03.558
<v Hou, Eric>You split, Nathan. Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1507-0
00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:15.088
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's really as easy as you can just
split the entire space and you know house</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1507-1
00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:22.678
<v Hou, Eric>size into bigger than 2500 square feet or
less than that so that you can tell those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1507-2
00:11:22.678 --> 00:11:27.828
<v Hou, Eric>those houses with house size more than
2500 square feet.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1519-0
00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:30.847
<v Hou, Eric>Or more expensive.
And then you can consider this the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1519-1
00:11:30.847 --> 00:11:32.748
<v Hou, Eric>average value of that sample pool.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1526-0
00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:35.558
<v Hou, Eric>As three $61,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1556-0
00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Hou, Eric>But for the house is lower than or
smaller than 2500 square feet,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1556-1
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.272
<v Hou, Eric>it has considered is a really
representing price is 280 K and then you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1556-2
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:47.888
<v Hou, Eric>can use that as a reference price, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1560-0
00:11:47.888 --> 00:11:49.248
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can do that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1564-0
00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:49.688
<v Hou, Eric>We can.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1588-0
00:11:49.688 --> 00:11:52.101
<v Hou, Eric>We can partition the entire space even
more,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1588-1
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:54.568
<v Hou, Eric>and then we can have like this decision
tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1588-2
00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:57.518
<v Hou, Eric>we can have this decision tree and going
even further,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1588-3
00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:59.448
<v Hou, Eric>we build more and more trees, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1595-0
00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:01.048
<v Hou, Eric>So then we will build more and more trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1606-0
00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:05.043
<v Hou, Eric>We have better,
better understanding of of whatever</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1606-1
00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:05.598
<v Hou, Eric>happened.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1616-0
00:12:06.028 --> 00:12:07.908
<v Hou, Eric>Right, so now you just like this?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1620-0
00:12:08.148 --> 00:12:11.108
<v Hou, Eric>So what you'll be facing is we.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1633-0
00:12:11.108 --> 00:12:14.390
<v Hou, Eric>We may be just overfeating our entire
data pool,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1633-1
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.068
<v Hou, Eric>and then there's any new data coming in.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1647-0
00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:23.908
<v Hou, Eric>We are losing the power of prediction
prediction power to any new data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1657-0
00:12:24.188 --> 00:12:29.588
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a risk of of having like more
complex tree meaning.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1669-0
00:12:30.348 --> 00:12:33.988
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, getting the depth of the tree. Uh,
higher and higher, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1676-0
00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:36.604
<v Hou, Eric>So,
but this is one good example of a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1676-1
00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:37.268
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1690-0
00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:44.508
<v Hou, Eric>Tree and then we saw another example for
a classification tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1699-0
00:12:44.988 --> 00:12:48.268
<v Hou, Eric>So then we created this example.
The loan approval, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1738-0
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:52.374
<v Hou, Eric>So then we say, hey,
we have two layer of information in</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1738-1
00:12:52.374 --> 00:12:57.273
<v Hou, Eric>common that we set up a rule that if the
income bigger than 10,000,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1738-2
00:12:57.273 --> 00:13:00.946
<v Hou, Eric>we prove the loan.
If the income less than 10,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1738-3
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:04.548
<v Hou, Eric>However more than 5000 and that is less
than 80%.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1748-0
00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:07.428
<v Hou, Eric>Of that, that person's income,
we also approve.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1753-0
00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.308
<v Hou, Eric>On. Otherwise, we're gonna denial.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1775-0
00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Hou, Eric>So project data into these two D
dimension plane,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1775-1
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.678
<v Hou, Eric>we can see those green and red dots.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1785-0
00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:22.598
<v Hou, Eric>So we can actually partition the data in
a way by the rule, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1806-0
00:13:22.598 --> 00:13:28.423
<v Hou, Eric>So then we are hoping that a decision
tree can learn and and and doing exactly</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1806-1
00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:32.478
<v Hou, Eric>what human humans are are are defining
the rule right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1820-0
00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:35.828
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we from our observation as a
human,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1820-1
00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:38.678
<v Hou, Eric>this is how we set up a rule because we.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1826-0
00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:40.508
<v Hou, Eric>Nowhere is 10,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1842-0
00:13:40.748 --> 00:13:48.101
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is 5004 thousand that so this
is a really the shadow area is how we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1842-1
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:49.388
<v Hou, Eric>define a rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1849-0
00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.518
<v Hou, Eric>And then we start building a tree, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1882-0
00:13:52.518 --> 00:13:58.621
<v Hou, Eric>So then we build a simple tree and then
it's is is like this and we project to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1882-1
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:04.028
<v Hou, Eric>this the same to the dimensions.
We found that we misclassified those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1882-2
00:14:04.028 --> 00:14:04.878
<v Hou, Eric>green dots.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1889-0
00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:09.118
<v Hou, Eric>We keep building another tree and getting
getting it more complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1909-0
00:14:10.108 --> 00:14:16.422
<v Hou, Eric>We we started misclassifying those red
dots and then we got a tree and more and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1909-1
00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.868
<v Hou, Eric>more complex. We found that OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1915-0
00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:21.198
<v Hou, Eric>Magic happened, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1939-0
00:14:21.198 --> 00:14:27.824
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just create some rule that
following exactly the same as the the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1939-1
00:14:27.824 --> 00:14:32.444
<v Hou, Eric>human rule,
so that we compare what the tree says is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1939-2
00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:38.198
<v Hou, Eric>literally like this and what the actual
rule was defined by Eric.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1941-0
00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:39.878
<v Hou, Eric>So then they are similar.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1951-0
00:14:40.388 --> 00:14:43.588
<v Hou, Eric>But for number per SE and they're not
quite similar.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1955-0
00:14:43.748 --> 00:14:45.348
<v Hou, Eric>But likewise.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1974-0
00:14:45.348 --> 00:14:51.736
<v Hou, Eric>So if you have more data the the 10,
100 and then it's 772 is getting more and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1974-1
00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:52.868
<v Hou, Eric>more close to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1984-0
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:59.278
<v Hou, Eric>That 10,
000 and 4000 threshold so definitely.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/1992-0
00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:02.038
<v Hou, Eric>Confident on that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2016-0
00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:06.944
<v Hou, Eric>So then we talk about, you know,
the decision tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2016-1
00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:13.485
<v Hou, Eric>how the decision tree works is we just
recursively splitting the tree into a a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2016-2
00:15:13.485 --> 00:15:14.478
<v Hou, Eric>binary tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2018-0
00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:15.038
<v Hou, Eric>We we were doing that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2041-0
00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:21.054
<v Hou, Eric>So the question is there is there is a so
many number of ways that we can split the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2041-1
00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:24.388
<v Hou, Eric>data and then we can build the trees to
start with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2051-0
00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:27.988
<v Hou, Eric>So what is the best way to to split a
tree?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2080-0
00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:33.097
<v Hou, Eric>What's the best threshold to split the
tree and what's the best metric column we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2080-1
00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:37.828
<v Hou, Eric>gonna use to split the data into a tree
for classification for regression?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2089-0
00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:41.748
<v Hou, Eric>So there are there are three criteria,
ones that Genie impurity.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2096-0
00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:43.718
<v Hou, Eric>Or or entropy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2099-0
00:15:43.718 --> 00:15:45.598
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the two different method.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2130-0
00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:52.142
<v Hou, Eric>More highly likely they gonna derive the
same result for these classification tree</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2130-1
00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:55.066
<v Hou, Eric>and and there's another one we can use

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2130-2
00:15:55.066 --> 00:15:58.188
<v Hou, Eric>The mean square error for for regression
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2158-0
00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:03.659
<v Hou, Eric>Just,
just as a note for for mean squared error,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2158-1
00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:06.519
<v Hou, Eric>so that sometimes we use a mean squared
error,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2158-2
00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:10.838
<v Hou, Eric>so that is the difference between the
actual value and the prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2162-0
00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:12.798
<v Hou, Eric>You have that difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2172-0
00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:16.958
<v Hou, Eric>You square it and then you sum it up and
divide by the total number of samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2183-0
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:20.748
<v Hou, Eric>That's the mean squared error means right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2195-0
00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:25.592
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know,
since the number of samples is a constant,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2195-1
00:16:25.592 --> 00:16:26.068
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2212-0
00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:30.828
<v Hou, Eric>So then say you have a 10 samples.
You calculate the square error across all</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2212-1
00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:33.548
<v Hou, Eric>the 10 pairs of actuals versus
predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2215-0
00:16:33.628 --> 00:16:34.628
<v Hou, Eric>You divide by 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2230-0
00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:39.508
<v Hou, Eric>You have 20 of actual numbers,
20 pairs of comparison.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2243-0
00:16:39.588 --> 00:16:43.668
<v Hou, Eric>You divide by 20,
so then 20 or 10 or or 100.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2245-0
00:16:43.868 --> 00:16:45.268
<v Hou, Eric>So that's a constant that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2248-0
00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:46.358
<v Hou, Eric>Will be facing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2252-0
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:47.908
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, based upon a fixed.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2257-0
00:16:49.478 --> 00:16:50.198
<v Hou, Eric>Pool of data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2267-0
00:16:50.478 --> 00:16:55.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then sometimes we just get we we just
ignore that number of samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2273-0
00:16:55.758 --> 00:16:57.678
<v Hou, Eric>We can even replace that by two.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2279-0
00:16:57.678 --> 00:17:00.918
<v Hou, Eric>I mean,
you see why we replace this with two.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2289-0
00:17:02.558 --> 00:17:04.438
<v Hou, Eric>But sometimes we just ignore that sample
size.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2298-0
00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:08.173
<v Hou, Eric>This is a constant here,
and a constant doesn't change anything,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2298-1
00:17:08.173 --> 00:17:08.518
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2318-0
00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:13.660
<v Hou, Eric>And the number different.
No times we have a root node.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2318-1
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Hou, Eric>Is the first ever node in a tree,
and then based upon this we made a first</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2318-2
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.038
<v Hou, Eric>ever split.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2327-0
00:17:20.408 --> 00:17:21.208
<v Hou, Eric>The leaf node.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2333-0
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:24.048
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the basically terminals that
we're going to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2336-0
00:17:24.048 --> 00:17:24.098
<v Hou, Eric>We're going to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2349-0
00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:27.465
<v Hou, Eric>We're going to have some prediction value
from those nodes,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2349-1
00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:31.448
<v Hou, Eric>and somewhere any anywhere in between
those are decision nodes, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2364-0
00:17:33.468 --> 00:17:40.042
<v Hou, Eric>And then we we talk about the different
formula for those splitting criteria,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2364-1
00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:40.548
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2372-0
00:17:40.548 --> 00:17:44.028
<v Hou, Eric>So then Genie impurity,
entropy and mean square.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2384-0
00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:49.308
<v Hou, Eric>So we gave some example of say based upon
this example how we gonna.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2399-0
00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:56.798
<v Hou, Eric>Split this tree by credit rate.
So we we calculate genie impurity, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2409-0
00:17:56.798 --> 00:18:01.358
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can buy buy credit rate by
student.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2412-0
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:02.878
<v Hou, Eric>So then we found out.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2438-0
00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:07.285
<v Hou, Eric>It seems like by student we have lower
Gen.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2438-1
00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:14.334
<v Hou, Eric>impurity value so then it shows to be in
terms to be a good decision or good tries</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2438-2
00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:15.948
<v Hou, Eric>to speed the table.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2446-0
00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:19.678
<v Hou, Eric>And then we we tried entropy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2453-0
00:18:19.678 --> 00:18:21.198
<v Hou, Eric>It is basically a different formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2457-0
00:18:22.238 --> 00:18:25.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have a we have same results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2487-0
00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:30.564
<v Hou, Eric>For MSE,
the issue is we have a continuous input X</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2487-1
00:18:30.564 --> 00:18:34.237
<v Hou, Eric>and then we have a continuous output draw
effectiveness.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2487-2
00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:36.878
<v Hou, Eric>Although they don't look like continuous.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2492-0
00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:39.838
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is how we just split.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2503-0
00:18:40.108 --> 00:18:46.028
<v Hou, Eric>In entire uh age into two, two area uh,
two sub intervals, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2517-0
00:18:47.758 --> 00:18:53.118
<v Hou, Eric>So then we try different MSE and then
that give us a better option.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2520-0
00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:53.958
<v Hou, Eric>How we do that?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2531-0
00:18:55.468 --> 00:19:00.308
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the materials we just
covered, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2548-0
00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:04.190
<v Hou, Eric>So then there are some other advantage of
using decision trees and there are some</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2548-1
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.988
<v Hou, Eric>disadvantages of using decision trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2556-0
00:19:07.878 --> 00:19:09.478
<v Hou, Eric>We know that decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2565-0
00:19:09.478 --> 00:19:14.758
<v Hou, Eric>Easy to interpret and then however really
are prone to overfilling.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2582-0
00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:20.649
<v Hou, Eric>We know that and we are talking also
talking about pruning and the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2582-1
00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:21.918
<v Hou, Eric>regularization right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2586-0
00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:25.798
<v Hou, Eric>So then, pruning is how we make.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2589-0
00:19:26.388 --> 00:19:27.868
<v Hou, Eric>The tree last complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2604-0
00:19:29.438 --> 00:19:33.918
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's similar to say, hey,
how we regularize our tree, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2610-0
00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:36.958
<v Hou, Eric>We we we start with we we we go.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2626-0
00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:41.444
<v Hou, Eric>We went with the same example,
the House size and house price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2626-1
00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:44.078
<v Hou, Eric>We've seen some really complex trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2634-0
00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:49.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have 3 trees and then and then.
If we really compare.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2643-0
00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:53.198
<v Hou, Eric>Their the summation of a square errors.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2645-0
00:19:53.198 --> 00:19:54.718
<v Hou, Eric>I you know, the more.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2653-0
00:19:55.268 --> 00:19:56.548
<v Hou, Eric>Leaves you go.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2655-0
00:19:56.948 --> 00:19:59.948
<v Hou, Eric>Likely the last error you have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2671-0
00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:05.450
<v Hou, Eric>So then that the the chart is definitely
showing that. But as we mentioned,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2671-1
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.348
<v Hou, Eric>it's definitely leading to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2690-0
00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:11.377
<v Hou, Eric>Prone to overfilling.
So here is one example,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2690-1
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:15.566
<v Hou, Eric>although we fully understand the training
data for the task data,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2690-2
00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:16.898
<v Hou, Eric>we are not there yet.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2732-0
00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:24.586
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is we need to penalize the
complexity and we do have alpha as a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2732-1
00:20:24.586 --> 00:20:30.194
<v Hou, Eric>parameter to penalize it.
And then so the more complex your tree</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2732-2
00:20:30.194 --> 00:20:35.284
<v Hou, Eric>goes, I will have.
I will add that to the your SSE to tell</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2732-3
00:20:35.284 --> 00:20:38.908
<v Hou, Eric>you that maybe you're adding more complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2757-0
00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:43.922
<v Hou, Eric>So that we do not need that.
So then giving alpha equal to 0 alpha</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2757-1
00:20:43.922 --> 00:20:47.708
<v Hou, Eric>equal to this number or or three times of
that number we.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2768-0
00:20:47.898 --> 00:20:53.218
<v Hou, Eric>Seeing totally different result and
totally different selection, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2792-0
00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:59.003
<v Hou, Eric>So then you say I I wanna penalize really
complex complex tree models and maybe you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2792-1
00:20:59.003 --> 00:21:01.138
<v Hou, Eric>wanna go to some simple models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2804-0
00:21:01.378 --> 00:21:08.898
<v Hou, Eric>So that's sort of a process to of
regularization and pruning a tree. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2814-0
00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:13.698
<v Hou, Eric>So that's pretty much what we covered in
the previous class. Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2825-0
00:21:22.518 --> 00:21:25.838
<v Hou, Eric>So we we sort of finish all their trees,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2834-0
00:21:25.838 --> 00:21:29.958
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so now I I have to make a comments, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2846-0
00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:35.198
<v Hou, Eric>So then just like we're in the, you know,
the human beings in funded.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2849-0
00:21:36.748 --> 00:21:37.388
<v Hou, Eric>Vehicles, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2863-0
00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:42.668
<v Hou, Eric>So then I believe at this moment we have
already covered scooters, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2864-0
00:21:43.108 --> 00:21:44.468
<v Hou, Eric>We already covered scooters.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2871-0
00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:48.188
<v Hou, Eric>We also covered, we also covered bicycles.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2883-0
00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:53.308
<v Hou, Eric>And we also cover some of the ski board
or anything like that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2889-0
00:21:53.618 --> 00:21:54.978
<v Hou, Eric>So then those are done.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2891-0
00:21:55.578 --> 00:21:57.538
<v Hou, Eric>We are officially.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2901-0
00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:02.108
<v Hou, Eric>Entering more of the ones that vehicles
right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2913-0
00:22:02.108 --> 00:22:06.237
<v Hou, Eric>So then we gonna talk about cars,
and then we're gonna talk about by seeing</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2913-1
00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:06.508
<v Hou, Eric>cars.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2949-0
00:22:06.508 --> 00:22:11.451
<v Hou, Eric>I mean I I meant ensemble trees and and
then we gonna talk about the neural</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2949-1
00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:14.638
<v Hou, Eric>networks.
That's gonna be more and more complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2949-2
00:22:14.638 --> 00:22:19.581
<v Hou, Eric>And then we gonna talk about we gonna we
gonna turn a newer networks into a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2949-3
00:22:19.581 --> 00:22:23.028
<v Hou, Eric>building break and talk about large
language models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2978-0
00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:27.421
<v Hou, Eric>So then from this very point,
from this very moment,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2978-1
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:32.455
<v Hou, Eric>the more models we gonna touch base on
will be much, much harder,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2978-2
00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:35.658
<v Hou, Eric>much much more difficult to interpret, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2998-0
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:42.048
<v Hou, Eric>Good news is the developers,
the Python developers,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/2998-1
00:22:42.048 --> 00:22:45.948
<v Hou, Eric>already have those complex concept into
their code.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3010-0
00:22:46.268 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Hou, Eric>So that when you actually use those
models in your real life,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3010-1
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.828
<v Hou, Eric>you just import a library.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3018-0
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:57.718
<v Hou, Eric>And call that function and change your
parameters.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3020-0
00:22:57.718 --> 00:22:59.118
<v Hou, Eric>Boom, you already have the results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3032-0
00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:02.375
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have to worry about what the
code behind the scene,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3032-1
00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:04.318
<v Hou, Eric>how they how they build those models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3034-0
00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:05.438
<v Hou, Eric>You do not have to do that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3054-0
00:23:06.988 --> 00:23:12.566
<v Hou, Eric>But in this class we gonna touch base
upon those algorithms and ideas behind</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3054-1
00:23:12.566 --> 00:23:13.508
<v Hou, Eric>those models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3067-0
00:23:14.068 --> 00:23:21.027
<v Hou, Eric>I hope you after this class you can tell
OK at least some highlights about one</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3067-1
00:23:21.027 --> 00:23:22.348
<v Hou, Eric>specific model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3072-0
00:23:22.348 --> 00:23:24.508
<v Hou, Eric>Why that model is better than another
model?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3077-0
00:23:24.938 --> 00:23:27.778
<v Hou, Eric>Because we will be talking about.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3082-0
00:23:30.668 --> 00:23:34.068
<v Hou, Eric>4 Ensemble Tree models today.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3087-0
00:23:35.788 --> 00:23:37.948
<v Hou, Eric>And one is based upon one article.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3108-0
00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:42.891
<v Hou, Eric>In 2016, I know you have,
you have been taking, you know,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3108-1
00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:46.348
<v Hou, Eric>I have taken some mathematics class.
We were talking about.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3128-0
00:23:46.348 --> 00:23:51.523
<v Hou, Eric>You know the the paper in 19th century in
in this machine learning area AI area we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3128-1
00:23:51.523 --> 00:23:54.828
<v Hou, Eric>are talking about all the paper published
last year.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3138-0
00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:58.138
<v Hou, Eric>Or or year later, two years ago.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3161-0
00:23:58.138 --> 00:24:02.414
<v Hou, Eric>Or sometimes we even have to talk about
the paper in this very year. For example,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3161-1
00:24:02.414 --> 00:24:06.011
<v Hou, Eric>if we talk about deep seg,
there's really some article in this year,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3161-2
00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:08.149
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
so that we are getting more and more</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3161-3
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.618
<v Hou, Eric>advanced.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3163-0
00:24:08.618 --> 00:24:09.018
<v Hou, Eric>We are.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3184-0
00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:13.527
<v Hou, Eric>We are getting more and more close to
what happened today,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3184-1
00:24:13.527 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Hou, Eric>so I'm afraid to say that we gonna talk
about more and more mathematics in this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3184-2
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.098
<v Hou, Eric>class.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3188-0
00:24:20.178 --> 00:24:21.858
<v Hou, Eric>I will try to make it easier.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3196-0
00:24:22.668 --> 00:24:27.068
<v Hou, Eric>And the calculation is only to
demonstrate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3235-0
00:24:27.218 --> 00:24:33.595
<v Hou, Eric>The idea behind those models I just want
to make clear there will be no homework</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3235-1
00:24:33.595 --> 00:24:39.657
<v Hou, Eric>and no final exam or any exam testing you
to write a proof of those of those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3235-2
00:24:39.657 --> 00:24:43.436
<v Hou, Eric>algorithms.
There is no because this is not the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3235-3
00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:46.978
<v Hou, Eric>computer science class. OK,
so you you just.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3250-0
00:24:46.978 --> 00:24:50.088
<v Hou, Eric>Go with me and let's just have fun with
mathematics,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3250-1
00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:52.258
<v Hou, Eric>and then you gonna use how to use it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3260-0
00:24:52.258 --> 00:24:56.149
<v Hou, Eric>You understand the, you know,
understand the difference between those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3260-1
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.538
<v Hou, Eric>models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3266-0
00:24:56.818 --> 00:24:58.178
<v Hou, Eric>That's it, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3274-0
00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:00.578
<v Hou, Eric>Although I just make it really as fancy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3286-0
00:25:00.578 --> 00:25:04.466
<v Hou, Eric>Well, fancy with cold,
with a lot of mathematics.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3286-1
00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:06.098
<v Hou, Eric>Beef after this line.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3291-0
00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:09.938
<v Hou, Eric>So then, but don't be afraid.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3295-0
00:25:09.938 --> 00:25:10.778
<v Hou, Eric>Don't be scared.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3306-0
00:25:10.778 --> 00:25:14.738
<v Hou, Eric>Those are just some something that I put
some comments in blue.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3335-0
00:25:14.738 --> 00:25:18.338
<v Hou, Eric>That's sort of in plain English,
and you might count definition,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3335-1
00:25:18.338 --> 00:25:22.437
<v Hou, Eric>but otherwise in black those are really
definitions. If you want to skip,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3335-2
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.098
<v Hou, Eric>you can skip all the formulas.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3337-0
00:25:24.258 --> 00:25:25.658
<v Hou, Eric>Just read whatever in blue.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3371-0
00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:31.879
<v Hou, Eric>Going forward, after this virus slide,
that's that'll be perfect for you to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3371-1
00:25:31.879 --> 00:25:35.308
<v Hou, Eric>understand those models if you want to
learn more,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3371-2
00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:39.208
<v Hou, Eric>try to do the math and I provide you
sufficient examples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3384-0
00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:43.648
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you can redo the math and then
you you find oh, that's so easy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3387-0
00:25:43.928 --> 00:25:46.448
<v Hou, Eric>And then that will be it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3420-0
00:25:46.448 --> 00:25:49.140
<v Hou, Eric>And I promise you,
we're not going to use some really</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3420-1
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.230
<v Hou, Eric>advanced, you know,
mathematics like the partial differential</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3420-2
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.722
<v Hou, Eric>equations,
the stochastic differential equations,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3420-3
00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:55.768
<v Hou, Eric>those kind of things.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3438-0
00:25:56.018 --> 00:26:01.050
<v Hou, Eric>Only thing you need to know you need to
use is the derivatives or partial</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3438-1
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.138
<v Hou, Eric>derivatives. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3440-0
00:26:02.378 --> 00:26:03.778
<v Hou, Eric>Anyone in this class?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3445-0
00:26:05.348 --> 00:26:07.828
<v Hou, Eric>Has has never taken.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3449-0
00:26:09.428 --> 00:26:10.868
<v Hou, Eric>College calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3468-0
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:17.232
<v Hou, Eric>About derivatives or partial derivatives,
do you guys need me to remind you the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3468-1
00:26:17.232 --> 00:26:19.268
<v Hou, Eric>derivatives and partial derivatives?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3470-0
00:26:22.498 --> 00:26:22.658
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3472-0
00:26:23.898 --> 00:26:24.418
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3479-0
00:26:25.258 --> 00:26:27.338
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK. OK, good. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3487-0
00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:29.738
<v Hou, Eric>So that means like I need to remind you,
right? So then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3495-0
00:26:31.308 --> 00:26:32.908
<v Hou, Eric>OK, let me give you one example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3503-0
00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:36.148
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just use the I just learned before
this class, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3504-0
00:26:36.148 --> 00:26:36.988
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me try.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3508-0
00:26:42.098 --> 00:26:45.978
<v Hou, Eric>Can you guys see my whiteboard here?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3511-0
00:26:46.998 --> 00:26:47.198
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yep.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3514-0
00:26:47.788 --> 00:26:48.988
<v Hou, Eric>OK, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3517-0
00:26:48.988 --> 00:26:50.908
<v Hou, Eric>So the derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3518-0
00:26:50.908 --> 00:26:52.268
<v Hou, Eric>Oh gosh, sorry.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3529-0
00:26:55.068 --> 00:26:59.108
<v Hou, Eric>And let me change your pant derivative,
right. So then deriv.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3531-0
00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:02.138
<v Hou, Eric>Dover.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3541-0
00:27:04.328 --> 00:27:07.448
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
I have a function called F of X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3553-0
00:27:09.868 --> 00:27:11.788
<v Hou, Eric>And then F of X = X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3567-0
00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:18.268
<v Hou, Eric>So then or I can call it this function
equal to Y so then y = X right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3581-0
00:27:18.268 --> 00:27:24.468
<v Hou, Eric>So then to calculate the derivative with
respect to XI will use a symbol like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3586-0
00:27:26.908 --> 00:27:28.748
<v Hou, Eric>DY over DX.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3609-0
00:27:32.238 --> 00:27:37.249
<v Hou, Eric>So given Y equals to X,
can someone tell me what is the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3609-1
00:27:37.249 --> 00:27:42.438
<v Hou, Eric>derivative of this X with respect to X
with respect to X?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3614-0
00:27:50.308 --> 00:27:50.868
<v Benbenek, Matthew>1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3615-0
00:27:51.488 --> 00:27:52.728
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, that will be one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3619-0
00:27:54.288 --> 00:27:54.728
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3631-0
00:27:54.728 --> 00:28:01.568
<v Hou, Eric>So if y = X and the derivative of this X
is actually one, right so then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3654-0
00:28:04.898 --> 00:28:10.658
<v Hou, Eric>Ben, if I may ask you or Matt,
I if I may ask you what kind of role are</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3654-1
00:28:10.658 --> 00:28:13.938
<v Hou, Eric>you using to have this result equal to 1?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3665-0
00:28:18.158 --> 00:28:20.798
<v Hou, Eric>There,
there's a role in in in college calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3667-0
00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:21.958
<v Hou, Eric>What is that role's name?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3675-0
00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:27.898
<v Benbenek, Matthew>I took this like eight years ago. Yeah.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3674-0
00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:27.048
<v Hou, Eric>Ten years ago.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3677-0
00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:29.028
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3682-0
00:28:29.028 --> 00:28:31.388
<v Hou, Eric>So this is called power role.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3687-0
00:28:32.988 --> 00:28:33.948
<v Hou, Eric>Does it remind you anything?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3692-0
00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:39.768
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Yeah, you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3695-0
00:28:40.288 --> 00:28:41.848
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Yeah, you take the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3710-0
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:49.563
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Exponent of the variable and then move it
down in front and then the variables n, -,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3710-1
00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:49.708
<v Benbenek, Matthew>1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3724-0
00:28:56.048 --> 00:28:58.928
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry for my handwriting 'cause I have to
use this touch board.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3731-0
00:28:59.328 --> 00:29:01.448
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is a power rule, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3746-0
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:07.787
<v Hou, Eric>So then the derivative of X to the north
equals the power.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3746-1
00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:10.688
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply X to the north -1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3750-0
00:29:11.978 --> 00:29:12.218
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3759-0
00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:18.018
<v Hou, Eric>It's called power rule. OK,
that's called power rule, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3779-0
00:29:18.018 --> 00:29:22.379
<v Hou, Eric>So what about I have?
So that's why I have one here,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3779-1
00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:26.658
<v Hou, Eric>this X to the power of 1 based upon the
power rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3784-0
00:29:26.658 --> 00:29:28.098
<v Hou, Eric>So this equals one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3808-0
00:29:28.098 --> 00:29:33.839
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply X to the 1 -, 1 where 1 -,
1 equal to 0,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3808-1
00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:40.498
<v Hou, Eric>and any number other than 0 to the power
of 0 equal to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3810-0
00:29:40.498 --> 00:29:41.658
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why it's.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3817-0
00:29:42.138 --> 00:29:44.058
<v Hou, Eric>Equals one. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3821-0
00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:47.418
<v Hou, Eric>It's based upon the power rule, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3826-0
00:29:47.658 --> 00:29:51.338
<v Hou, Eric>So what about Y equal 2X?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3833-0
00:29:53.028 --> 00:29:55.948
<v Hou, Eric>So what is a DUY over DX?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3836-0
00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:05.608
<v Benbenek, Matthew>2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3855-0
00:30:07.148 --> 00:30:10.362
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, this too,
because that's basically 2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3855-1
00:30:10.362 --> 00:30:13.868
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply the derivative of X with respect
to X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3858-0
00:30:13.938 --> 00:30:14.778
<v Hou, Eric>We know it's a one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3862-0
00:30:14.778 --> 00:30:16.498
<v Hou, Eric>So then there's actually 2 multiple ones.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3866-0
00:30:16.498 --> 00:30:18.858
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so just to show you that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3875-0
00:30:20.988 --> 00:30:27.028
<v Hou, Eric>A XNA number multiply a function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3889-0
00:30:28.588 --> 00:30:31.868
<v Hou, Eric>And the derivative of a number multiply
function equal to that number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3893-0
00:30:32.068 --> 00:30:37.148
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply the derivative of that function,
OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3909-0
00:30:38.788 --> 00:30:42.235
<v Hou, Eric>So.
So that means this derivative function is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3909-1
00:30:42.235 --> 00:30:44.708
<v Hou, Eric>a linear is a linear function OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3911-0
00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:47.988
<v Hou, Eric>And how about we calculate?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3916-0
00:30:50.988 --> 00:30:54.708
<v Hou, Eric>1 -, X ^2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3923-0
00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:57.558
<v Hou, Eric>And what is the D?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3925-0
00:30:57.558 --> 00:30:59.678
<v Hou, Eric>Y over DX.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3931-0
00:31:13.008 --> 00:31:14.128
<v Hou, Eric>And you volunteer.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3944-0
00:31:25.518 --> 00:31:30.918
<v Hou, Eric>Or we will be using another rule in your
college calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3947-0
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.758
<v Hou, Eric>I hope someone can tell me that as well.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3950-0
00:31:46.358 --> 00:31:47.118
<v Hou, Eric>Anyone.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3952-0
00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:54.598
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3957-0
00:31:54.598 --> 00:31:56.158
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe this is a really a long time.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3966-0
00:31:56.158 --> 00:32:00.558
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just tell you.
So this one called the chain rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3977-0
00:32:02.708 --> 00:32:05.948
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you guys do remember it right?
So chain rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3999-0
00:32:05.948 --> 00:32:12.548
<v Hou, Eric>So then what does mean is I will consider
this entire 1 -, X as as another variable,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/3999-1
00:32:12.548 --> 00:32:13.868
<v Hou, Eric>call it Z, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4015-0
00:32:14.388 --> 00:32:20.761
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say if I were,
if I were solving Y equal y = Z square,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4015-1
00:32:20.761 --> 00:32:21.388
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4022-0
00:32:21.388 --> 00:32:26.028
<v Hou, Eric>So then DY over DX is actually dy over dz.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4029-0
00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:33.708
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply DZ over DX.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4053-0
00:32:36.878 --> 00:32:42.942
<v Hou, Eric>Where DY over DZ is the derivative of
this Z square with respect to Z and that</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4053-1
00:32:42.942 --> 00:32:45.398
<v Hou, Eric>is by the power rule that is 2Z.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4061-0
00:32:49.298 --> 00:32:50.778
<v Hou, Eric>And DZ over DX.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4066-0
00:32:50.778 --> 00:32:54.058
<v Hou, Eric>So what is the derivative of 1 -, X?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4069-0
00:32:57.878 --> 00:32:59.038
<v Hou, Eric>With respect to X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4099-0
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:09.515
<v Hou, Eric>So the derivative of a constant equal to
0,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4099-1
00:33:09.515 --> 00:33:20.582
<v Hou, Eric>so derivative of X is -1 so that this 1 =
-, 2 Z, which equals -2 one minus Z 1 -,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4099-2
00:33:20.582 --> 00:33:20.848
<v Hou, Eric>X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4105-0
00:33:22.538 --> 00:33:25.538
<v Hou, Eric>So this is called chain rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4107-0
00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:27.108
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4111-0
00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:36.198
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions so far?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4113-0
00:33:42.618 --> 00:33:43.098
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4121-0
00:33:44.668 --> 00:33:46.508
<v Hou, Eric>And now let's talk about partial
derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4128-0
00:33:55.498 --> 00:33:57.658
<v Hou, Eric>So partial derivative is like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4133-0
00:33:57.698 --> 00:34:00.498
<v Hou, Eric>So that you have a function X&amp;Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4142-0
00:34:03.398 --> 00:34:07.198
<v Hou, Eric>Where this one equal to, let's say X + y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4171-0
00:34:10.938 --> 00:34:15.087
<v Hou, Eric>I wanna know, OK,
that the symbol of this is a little bit</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4171-1
00:34:15.087 --> 00:34:18.306
<v Hou, Eric>different.
Instead of using this kind of ad,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4171-2
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:23.098
<v Hou, Eric>I'll be using a different version kind of
D as a kind of curved D.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4177-0
00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:27.148
<v Hou, Eric>So what is a DF over?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4180-0
00:34:29.388 --> 00:34:29.468
<v Hou, Eric>DX.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4195-0
00:34:33.698 --> 00:34:38.178
<v Hou, Eric>So for partial derivative I have two
variables X&amp;Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4223-0
00:34:39.298 --> 00:34:45.479
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will be taking the derivative
of the function F with respect to one of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4223-1
00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:51.125
<v Hou, Eric>those two variables which is X.
In this formula I will be considering the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4223-2
00:34:51.125 --> 00:34:53.338
<v Hou, Eric>other variable as a constant.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4228-0
00:34:54.218 --> 00:34:57.618
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then if I'm taking DF.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4240-0
00:34:58.988 --> 00:35:02.788
<v Hou, Eric>DX so taking the derivative of this one
with respect to X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4260-0
00:35:03.418 --> 00:35:12.258
<v Hou, Eric>Is no different to taking a derivative of
X + 1 X plus One X + y for X is the same.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4273-0
00:35:13.218 --> 00:35:17.538
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know the derivative of X1
with respect to X is just one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4283-0
00:35:18.178 --> 00:35:22.618
<v Hou, Eric>So then the partial derivative of this X
+ y is just one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4289-0
00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:25.418
<v Hou, Eric>If I change a little bit right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4297-0
00:35:25.418 --> 00:35:31.211
<v Hou, Eric>SO2X, however,
partial derivative of XF with respect to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4297-1
00:35:31.211 --> 00:35:31.418
<v Hou, Eric>Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4303-0
00:35:33.068 --> 00:35:36.188
<v Hou, Eric>I will do exactly the opposite.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4313-0
00:35:36.188 --> 00:35:41.348
<v Hou, Eric>I will consider X as as a constant and Y
as.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4320-0
00:35:43.188 --> 00:35:44.268
<v Hou, Eric>As as a variable, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4328-0
00:35:44.268 --> 00:35:47.588
<v Hou, Eric>So then the partial F divided by partial
Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4338-0
00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:53.028
<v Hou, Eric>So I will have the result equal to two
not not one because I have two Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4367-0
00:35:54.668 --> 00:36:00.348
<v Hou, Eric>So this basically the rule of the partial
derivatives and partial derivative could</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4367-1
00:36:00.348 --> 00:36:04.249
<v Hou, Eric>be more complex,
but I think this is good enough for you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4367-2
00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:08.628
<v Hou, Eric>guys to to to know to to continue the
class. So just highlight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4372-0
00:36:10.188 --> 00:36:11.988
<v Hou, Eric>Two things. Power rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4380-0
00:36:12.548 --> 00:36:16.048
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely something we gonna use and
chain rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4380-1
00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.428
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely something we gonna use.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4384-0
00:36:21.938 --> 00:36:23.178
<v Hou, Eric>And a partial.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4406-0
00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the things that we
definitely gonna use in this class going</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4406-1
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.458
<v Hou, Eric>forward. And then that's quite important.
But they're not hard. You go back to your.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4417-0
00:36:38.228 --> 00:36:40.515
<v Hou, Eric>College I I do not know.
Like the market system,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4417-1
00:36:40.515 --> 00:36:41.588
<v Hou, Eric>but definitely you can.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4427-0
00:36:41.748 --> 00:36:46.228
<v Hou, Eric>You can find books, the college,
college calculus, and definitely you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4428-0
00:36:46.468 --> 00:36:47.348
<v Hou, Eric>You'll be.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4431-0
00:36:47.628 --> 00:36:48.588
<v Hou, Eric>You can learn it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4438-0
00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:53.948
<v Hou, Eric>No, no, no big deal. OK. So those, those,
those three things.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4441-0
00:36:55.708 --> 00:36:56.268
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4451-0
00:36:57.178 --> 00:37:00.178
<v Hou, Eric>Is that too complicated or just OK
complicated?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4460-0
00:37:04.998 --> 00:37:06.558
<v Mertens, Aidric>Starting to get a little complicated.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4458-0
00:37:05.258 --> 00:37:06.498
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Just haven't done in a while.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4481-0
00:37:07.108 --> 00:37:11.446
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK, OK, OK. But you know,
with some exercises, you, you,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4481-1
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:15.428
<v Hou, Eric>you certainly look,
you can pick up your memory, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4483-0
00:37:15.428 --> 00:37:16.668
<v Hou, Eric>So then those definitely.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4506-0
00:37:18.228 --> 00:37:22.420
<v Hou, Eric>You, you you have learned and market,
you have learned it at different</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4506-1
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.788
<v Hou, Eric>universities to definitely cover those
those derivative rules, right. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4514-0
00:37:28.388 --> 00:37:29.348
<v Hou, Eric>Let's continue, OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4518-0
00:37:29.348 --> 00:37:31.748
<v Hou, Eric>So power rule, change rule and partial K.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4523-0
00:37:34.178 --> 00:37:36.458
<v Hou, Eric>Right. Let me go back to my slide.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4525-0
00:37:47.528 --> 00:37:48.008
<v Hou, Eric>Hey.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4542-0
00:37:49.108 --> 00:37:54.771
<v Hou, Eric>So we're not directly gonna use that,
just a kind reminder that we will be</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4542-1
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:56.508
<v Hou, Eric>using some of this, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4557-0
00:37:57.068 --> 00:38:03.508
<v Hou, Eric>So we we talk about the tree models and
then let's say we have this data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4560-0
00:38:03.508 --> 00:38:04.588
<v Hou, Eric>How many rows do we have?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4570-0
00:38:04.588 --> 00:38:07.948
<v Hou, Eric>We have 12345678910.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4578-0
00:38:07.948 --> 00:38:12.348
<v Hou, Eric>We have 10 rows of data.
We want to learn about.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4580-0
00:38:13.868 --> 00:38:13.908
<v Hou, Eric>How?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4591-0
00:38:15.548 --> 00:38:18.988
<v Hou, Eric>How size number bedrooms and the year
built?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4597-0
00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:22.458
<v Hou, Eric>Are affecting the house price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4603-0
00:38:23.498 --> 00:38:25.658
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, just this open-ended question.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4606-0
00:38:25.658 --> 00:38:26.578
<v Hou, Eric>What should we do?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4608-0
00:38:26.578 --> 00:38:27.858
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of model should we build?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4617-0
00:38:29.688 --> 00:38:31.622
<v Hou, Eric>I mean,
you can talk about any models we have</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4617-1
00:38:31.622 --> 00:38:32.168
<v Hou, Eric>built before.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4634-0
00:38:35.368 --> 00:38:41.423
<v Hou, Eric>So this is our those are our target.
How what kind of model can we build to to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4634-1
00:38:41.423 --> 00:38:44.488
<v Hou, Eric>learn how the other three affecting the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4641-0
00:38:46.028 --> 00:38:49.228
<v Hou, Eric>The this. Yeah, I see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4649-0
00:38:49.228 --> 00:38:51.891
<v Hou, Eric>And you,
you can just say you you don't have to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4649-1
00:38:51.891 --> 00:38:52.668
<v Hou, Eric>type everyone.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4655-0
00:38:56.258 --> 00:38:58.058
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah, I wrote that linear regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4678-0
00:38:58.948 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Haroon, Sufyan>You could use linear regressions to learn
about how the target variable the house</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4678-1
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.068
<v Haroon, Sufyan>prices is impacted by house size,
number of bedrooms or your build.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4681-0
00:39:10.188 --> 00:39:12.028
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect. Any other ideas?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4684-0
00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:13.308
<v Hou, Eric>This is a review we are.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4687-0
00:39:13.308 --> 00:39:14.948
<v Hou, Eric>We're not talking about anything new.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4693-0
00:39:17.748 --> 00:39:20.588
<v Hou, Eric>Any other things and any other idea?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4701-0
00:39:31.498 --> 00:39:32.898
<v Severin, Noah>Could also use K NN.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4704-0
00:39:33.418 --> 00:39:34.898
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, we can use KN.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4706-0
00:39:38.598 --> 00:39:39.438
<v Hou, Eric>Any other ideas?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4717-0
00:39:54.898 --> 00:39:57.138
<v Hou, Eric>We can use a regression tree for sure.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4725-0
00:40:03.598 --> 00:40:05.318
<v Hou, Eric>OK, among those three ideas.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4729-0
00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:07.958
<v Hou, Eric>So, Haroon,
you mentioned linear regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4744-0
00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:15.119
<v Hou, Eric>You mentioned this KNN,
but do you think we have only sample N</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4744-1
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.188
<v Hou, Eric>equal to 10?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4757-0
00:40:17.338 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think we have a big amount of data
to either train our linear regression</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4757-1
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:22.938
<v Hou, Eric>model or km model?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4763-0
00:40:24.508 --> 00:40:26.028
<v Hou, Eric>Only based upon 10 samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4770-0
00:40:31.898 --> 00:40:33.058
<v Severin, Noah>I would say no for KNN.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4773-0
00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:35.488
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I agree with you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4780-0
00:40:36.248 --> 00:40:37.448
<v Hou, Eric>I I totally agree with you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4784-0
00:40:38.528 --> 00:40:40.648
<v Hou, Eric>For linear regression, maybe not either.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4788-0
00:40:40.648 --> 00:40:43.088
<v Hou, Eric>This is only 10, only 10 samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4809-0
00:40:44.628 --> 00:40:49.326
<v Hou, Eric>Any idea that we can create more samples
for us for any algorithm to learn based</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4809-1
00:40:49.326 --> 00:40:51.588
<v Hou, Eric>upon only 10 samples that we collected?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4821-0
00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:59.458
<v Haroon, Sufyan>You can make predictions out of these ten
and then use other methods.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4850-0
00:41:02.638 --> 00:41:06.194
<v Hou, Eric>For sure.
But but that means like if you consider</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4850-1
00:41:06.194 --> 00:41:10.958
<v Hou, Eric>are you suggesting I use,
let's say eight of them as train and two</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4850-2
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:14.798
<v Hou, Eric>of them as tasks and then use other
method to fix it?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4852-0
00:41:15.448 --> 00:41:15.808
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4855-0
00:41:16.298 --> 00:41:16.858
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4871-0
00:41:16.858 --> 00:41:20.822
<v Hou, Eric>That's a good idea, but you know,
instead of learning from 10,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4871-1
00:41:20.822 --> 00:41:22.458
<v Hou, Eric>you're learning from 8:00.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4873-0
00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:23.378
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4879-0
00:41:23.058 --> 00:41:26.018
<v Hou, Eric>So you're actually losing some
information in in your model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4884-0
00:41:35.158 --> 00:41:35.958
<v Hou, Eric>That's a good idea.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4889-0
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:38.518
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, we can do tree and task.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4903-0
00:41:42.498 --> 00:41:47.788
<v Hou, Eric>The issue of training task speed is we
are losing some information but you can</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4903-1
00:41:47.788 --> 00:41:48.658
<v Hou, Eric>use fivefold.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4913-0
00:41:53.058 --> 00:41:56.858
<v Hou, Eric>But still for any training model you are
losing that information.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4917-0
00:41:59.108 --> 00:42:00.628
<v Hou, Eric>Any other suggestions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4930-0
00:42:22.618 --> 00:42:24.898
<v Hou, Eric>The idea is, you know, out of 10, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4932-0
00:42:24.898 --> 00:42:27.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know what?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4938-0
00:42:28.868 --> 00:42:30.388
<v Hou, Eric>Can we do random selection?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4981-0
00:42:34.538 --> 00:42:38.089
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just you know select this
select this,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4981-1
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:42.298
<v Hou, Eric>select this and then select this and then
randomly select them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4981-2
00:42:42.298 --> 00:42:46.638
<v Hou, Eric>Some of them are going to repeat,
but I'm going to recreate this,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4981-3
00:42:46.638 --> 00:42:50.978
<v Hou, Eric>this this data set into like one or two
or three of them so each.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4999-0
00:42:50.978 --> 00:42:55.016
<v Hou, Eric>Of them have have three have 10 samples,
although they have,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/4999-1
00:42:55.016 --> 00:42:58.458
<v Hou, Eric>they have different complete.
But I have more data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5001-0
00:42:59.308 --> 00:42:59.628
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5011-0
00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:04.708
<v Hou, Eric>More data to use and this is the idea
that is called bootstrapping.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5029-0
00:43:06.888 --> 00:43:14.768
<v Hou, Eric>So bootstrapping is something we're gonna
talk about today is one idea.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5041-0
00:43:14.768 --> 00:43:20.048
<v Hou, Eric>You can create a new data set by randomly
selecting data points from the original 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5052-0
00:43:20.688 --> 00:43:25.958
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can sort of making new data
sets and then you can learn from it,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5052-1
00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:26.368
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5068-0
00:43:26.768 --> 00:43:31.959
<v Hou, Eric>So then every single boostraving sample,
they have the same size as before as the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5068-1
00:43:31.959 --> 00:43:34.048
<v Hou, Eric>original one. You you start with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5078-0
00:43:34.828 --> 00:43:37.508
<v Hou, Eric>But and then also they may have some
repeated points, but.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5094-0
00:43:38.138 --> 00:43:44.842
<v Hou, Eric>The issue the the good news is you can
create a list of data sets and learn from</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5094-1
00:43:44.842 --> 00:43:45.338
<v Hou, Eric>right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5097-0
00:43:45.658 --> 00:43:46.698
<v Hou, Eric>So what we can do?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5100-0
00:43:46.698 --> 00:43:47.898
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see an example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5111-0
00:43:47.898 --> 00:43:53.218
<v Hou, Eric>So we start with the original data that
we have seen. There's only 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5113-0
00:43:54.788 --> 00:43:55.028
<v Hou, Eric>Samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5124-0
00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:58.708
<v Hou, Eric>We do the first round of random selection.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5126-0
00:43:59.188 --> 00:44:00.788
<v Hou, Eric>We have the first data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5142-0
00:44:02.508 --> 00:44:07.188
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see this one and this one are
are, are are duplicate right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5143-0
00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:07.788
<v Hou, Eric>So then the same.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5145-0
00:44:07.788 --> 00:44:08.508
<v Hou, Eric>Same here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5155-0
00:44:09.068 --> 00:44:12.308
<v Hou, Eric>So then we select this same record three
times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5189-0
00:44:13.268 --> 00:44:18.389
<v Hou, Eric>So then and for this one we have select
this 21262 times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5189-1
00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:24.127
<v Hou, Eric>I believe there are and also this this
20952 times for this one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5189-2
00:44:24.127 --> 00:44:28.188
<v Hou, Eric>This is definitely duplicates and
duplicates.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5206-0
00:44:28.908 --> 00:44:34.161
<v Hou, Eric>We have other duplicates so that we can
create not not only three we can create</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5206-1
00:44:34.161 --> 00:44:35.868
<v Hou, Eric>like four or five of them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5217-0
00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:40.428
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say we have we we we converted
the one data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5220-0
00:44:40.818 --> 00:44:42.298
<v Hou, Eric>Into 3 datasets.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5228-0
00:44:43.868 --> 00:44:46.308
<v Hou, Eric>We can also do the tricks like the linear
regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5232-0
00:44:48.028 --> 00:44:48.708
<v Hou, Eric>The KNN.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5238-0
00:44:49.468 --> 00:44:50.548
<v Hou, Eric>It's a little bit tricky.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5245-0
00:44:50.548 --> 00:44:54.508
<v Hou, Eric>I will say no because they still the the
sample size still.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5249-0
00:44:56.468 --> 00:44:57.108
<v Hou, Eric>The sample size still 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5259-0
00:44:58.908 --> 00:45:01.508
<v Hou, Eric>But for regression tree this is perfect.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5268-0
00:45:02.228 --> 00:45:05.188
<v Hou, Eric>I can build a regression tree on top of
this data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5277-0
00:45:05.788 --> 00:45:08.748
<v Hou, Eric>I can build a regression tree on top of
this data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5283-0
00:45:09.148 --> 00:45:11.948
<v Hou, Eric>I can build a regression tree on top of
this data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5296-0
00:45:13.038 --> 00:45:18.317
<v Hou, Eric>So knowing that for let's call it,
is at a right knowing for data set AI</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5296-1
00:45:18.317 --> 00:45:18.678
<v Hou, Eric>have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5310-0
00:45:20.228 --> 00:45:23.148
<v Hou, Eric>22 and these are 2294 square feet.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5314-0
00:45:23.148 --> 00:45:25.108
<v Hou, Eric>Record showed up three times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5328-0
00:45:25.668 --> 00:45:29.255
<v Hou, Eric>Arguably this data,
this regression tree gonna be really</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5328-1
00:45:29.255 --> 00:45:30.828
<v Hou, Eric>accurate for this record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5349-0
00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:37.917
<v Hou, Eric>So this regression tree gonna be our
expert predicting the the house size</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5349-1
00:45:37.917 --> 00:45:42.228
<v Hou, Eric>close to 2294 square feet and four
bedrooms.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5357-0
00:45:42.538 --> 00:45:44.378
<v Hou, Eric>And it during the year 2012.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5397-0
00:45:44.858 --> 00:45:51.876
<v Hou, Eric>So this is our asper in that area and
these regression tree gonna be our expert</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5397-1
00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:57.227
<v Hou, Eric>in predicting this.
Umm this house size close to 2100 square</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5397-2
00:45:57.227 --> 00:46:03.807
<v Hou, Eric>feet and this gonna be our expert
predicting bigger house size for example</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5397-3
00:46:03.807 --> 00:46:05.298
<v Hou, Eric>like 2638 square.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5405-0
00:46:05.298 --> 00:46:08.618
<v Hou, Eric>Feet. So we have three sort of different.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5414-0
00:46:10.188 --> 00:46:12.868
<v Hou, Eric>Expert and we can even doing this
bootstrapping.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5422-0
00:46:13.298 --> 00:46:16.418
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm bootstrapping this process
even further.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5445-0
00:46:16.418 --> 00:46:22.007
<v Hou, Eric>We have another seven of data sets and
then we are employing different</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5445-1
00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:26.178
<v Hou, Eric>regression tree on top of those data sets
like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5454-0
00:46:26.978 --> 00:46:33.338
<v Hou, Eric>So for data set one we build a tree on
top of it looks like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5467-0
00:46:34.908 --> 00:46:38.480
<v Hou, Eric>For data set two,
we build a tree on top of this we have a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5467-1
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.388
<v Hou, Eric>tree like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5472-0
00:46:40.218 --> 00:46:42.058
<v Hou, Eric>For this one, we have a tree like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5477-0
00:46:43.628 --> 00:46:44.828
<v Hou, Eric>So then the final.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5485-0
00:46:46.468 --> 00:46:47.548
<v Hou, Eric>Rocess is we have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5493-0
00:46:47.548 --> 00:46:51.748
<v Hou, Eric>We start with A1.
We start with A1 data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5505-0
00:46:52.668 --> 00:46:57.830
<v Hou, Eric>We're doing a bootstrapping and
converting one data set into three like</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5505-1
00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:58.188
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5510-0
00:47:00.028 --> 00:47:01.748
<v Hou, Eric>And then we build.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5522-0
00:47:03.388 --> 00:47:07.868
<v Hou, Eric>For each data set through that
bootstrapping process one tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5524-0
00:47:08.468 --> 00:47:09.068
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5541-0
00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:14.455
<v Hou, Eric>Instead of having one tree solving entire
data set with 10 records,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5541-1
00:47:14.455 --> 00:47:16.218
<v Hou, Eric>we have three data sets.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5556-0
00:47:16.218 --> 00:47:21.938
<v Hou, Eric>We have 3 trees on top of three data sets
and total 30 records.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5565-0
00:47:22.338 --> 00:47:27.338
<v Hou, Eric>So we have a tree,
First Tree 2nd and tree the third.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5572-0
00:47:27.858 --> 00:47:31.698
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why we are saying we are
building a forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5577-0
00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:35.148
<v Hou, Eric>A group of trees, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5585-0
00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:39.588
<v Hou, Eric>We are building a group of trees.
Just because these bootstrapping.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5603-0
00:47:40.178 --> 00:47:45.420
<v Hou, Eric>There are some random selection
randomness involved so that those records</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5603-1
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.978
<v Hou, Eric>are randomly selected.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5612-0
00:47:47.218 --> 00:47:51.858
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why we call this kind of method
random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5642-0
00:47:53.428 --> 00:47:57.565
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
Random representing to the moment you're</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5642-1
00:47:57.565 --> 00:48:04.805
<v Hou, Eric>you're creating different data sets based
upon one original data set through random</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5642-2
00:48:04.805 --> 00:48:09.028
<v Hou, Eric>selection,
and forest is really meaning a group.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5656-0
00:48:09.298 --> 00:48:18.378
<v Hou, Eric>Of trees built upon each data set created
through this bootstrapping process. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5662-0
00:48:18.698 --> 00:48:20.498
<v Hou, Eric>So this is called random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5663-0
00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:21.298
<v Hou, Eric>You have this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5666-0
00:48:21.618 --> 00:48:22.978
<v Hou, Eric>You have this random.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5697-0
00:48:23.698 --> 00:48:28.216
<v Hou, Eric>Those are trees,
which is the forest in case we have a new</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5697-1
00:48:28.216 --> 00:48:33.422
<v Hou, Eric>prediction data coming in.
We are predicting how size equal to this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5697-2
00:48:33.422 --> 00:48:38.858
<v Hou, Eric>number of bedrooms equal to this and the
year built equal to 2021. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5701-0
00:48:39.098 --> 00:48:39.978
<v Hou, Eric>How do I do that?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5718-0
00:48:40.778 --> 00:48:44.630
<v Hou, Eric>We gonna have a prediction from the first
ever tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5718-1
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.900
<v Hou, Eric>We have the prediction from the second
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5718-2
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.098
<v Hou, Eric>We have the prediction from the third
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5725-0
00:48:52.668 --> 00:48:55.268
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so different trees, like what?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5730-0
00:48:55.268 --> 00:48:57.028
<v Hou, Eric>I said are coming from different aspect.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5749-0
00:48:58.668 --> 00:49:04.828
<v Hou, Eric>The first tree is an asper predicting any
house size around 2294 square feet.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5757-0
00:49:05.348 --> 00:49:09.988
<v Hou, Eric>The second tree are the expert predicting
a good at predicting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5769-0
00:49:10.978 --> 00:49:14.498
<v Hou, Eric>The house size close to 2100 square feet.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5777-0
00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:18.258
<v Hou, Eric>The third tree is so good I had
predicting big houses.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5788-0
00:49:18.338 --> 00:49:22.698
<v Hou, Eric>I have 3 experts and they gave me 3 ideas.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5796-0
00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:27.618
<v Hou, Eric>The first idea is really predicting some
middle size classes, that's why.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5822-0
00:49:29.188 --> 00:49:35.248
<v Hou, Eric>Expert prediction of the house and that's
that prediction of the house and this one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5822-1
00:49:35.248 --> 00:49:39.668
<v Hou, Eric>So if because this House size two 2600 is
a really big house.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5835-0
00:49:40.698 --> 00:49:45.067
<v Hou, Eric>I will trust this one more,
but you know I have to take care of a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5835-1
00:49:45.067 --> 00:49:46.258
<v Hou, Eric>different opinion.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5847-0
00:49:46.258 --> 00:49:49.618
<v Hou, Eric>So then the final prediction could be
just an average of those 3 numbers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5853-0
00:49:50.658 --> 00:49:52.378
<v Hou, Eric>So I do not have anybody.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5872-0
00:49:52.498 --> 00:49:56.885
<v Hou, Eric>I listen to all the expert and then their
their, their,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5872-1
00:49:56.885 --> 00:50:00.018
<v Hou, Eric>their their average is my my prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5878-0
00:50:00.738 --> 00:50:03.538
<v Hou, Eric>So random Forest is working in this way.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5880-0
00:50:03.538 --> 00:50:05.058
<v Hou, Eric>It's as simple as this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5883-0
00:50:06.748 --> 00:50:06.988
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5897-0
00:50:06.988 --> 00:50:09.974
<v Hou, Eric>I I'm pretty sure you guys heard,
heard about, you know,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5897-1
00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:11.388
<v Hou, Eric>heard of the random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5908-0
00:50:12.978 --> 00:50:17.298
<v Hou, Eric>But Random forest is nothing more than
just building.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5915-0
00:50:19.728 --> 00:50:23.168
<v Hou, Eric>So many data set through random selection.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5923-0
00:50:25.758 --> 00:50:30.198
<v Hou, Eric>Tree based upon each one, each data set,
and then you bunch it AU.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5934-0
00:50:30.198 --> 00:50:33.518
<v Hou, Eric>Just summarize or aggregate the final
prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5936-0
00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:35.598
<v Hou, Eric>That's how random 4 is working.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5962-0
00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:44.392
<v Hou, Eric>And the eventual this process that we
have prediction coming from each tree and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5962-1
00:50:44.392 --> 00:50:49.448
<v Hou, Eric>then how we aggregate them,
it's called bagging, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5968-0
00:50:49.688 --> 00:50:54.688
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have multiple data sets you
train.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5971-0
00:50:55.518 --> 00:50:57.598
<v Hou, Eric>Multiple decision trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5984-0
00:50:59.168 --> 00:51:02.928
<v Hou, Eric>You make prediction by averaging them, OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5996-0
00:51:03.288 --> 00:51:07.795
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're just basically aggregating
all the final predictions,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/5996-1
00:51:07.795 --> 00:51:10.408
<v Hou, Eric>and this is called packing and and it's.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6005-0
00:51:10.608 --> 00:51:13.448
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically the idea behind the
random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6006-0
00:51:14.048 --> 00:51:15.248
<v Hou, Eric>I hope that's easy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6031-0
00:51:15.248 --> 00:51:19.948
<v Hou, Eric>This is the first ever ensemble tree
model we are talking about random forest</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6031-1
00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:24.346
<v Hou, Eric>and some articles are really talking
about you know why random forest is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6031-2
00:51:24.346 --> 00:51:24.768
<v Hou, Eric>better.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6033-0
00:51:25.558 --> 00:51:26.078
<v Hou, Eric>Then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6039-0
00:51:27.648 --> 00:51:29.808
<v Hou, Eric>Then the single decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6064-0
00:51:30.528 --> 00:51:33.165
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then if you were talking about this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6064-1
00:51:33.165 --> 00:51:36.031
<v Hou, Eric>the miscalculation error,
a single decision tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6064-2
00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:37.808
<v Hou, Eric>this is a single decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6075-0
00:51:37.808 --> 00:51:42.747
<v Hou, Eric>Miscalculation error and this is the
random forest and and it's definitely</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6075-1
00:51:42.747 --> 00:51:43.208
<v Hou, Eric>better.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6085-0
00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:47.448
<v Hou, Eric>So significant decrease of a
misclassification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6087-0
00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:49.728
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6099-0
00:51:51.278 --> 00:51:54.678
<v Hou, Eric>And then I think we're, we're done for,
for, for random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6103-0
00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:56.478
<v Hou, Eric>I hope this is easy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6107-0
00:51:57.078 --> 00:51:58.478
<v Hou, Eric>We didn't use any calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6114-0
00:51:58.478 --> 00:52:01.518
<v Hou, Eric>We just basically using some simple idea.
We create some.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6142-0
00:52:03.088 --> 00:52:08.468
<v Hou, Eric>Data based upon the data that we we
originally have and then we just enrich</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6142-1
00:52:08.468 --> 00:52:12.928
<v Hou, Eric>our data set, we we build the forest,
we aggregate the result.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6150-0
00:52:13.288 --> 00:52:17.608
<v Hou, Eric>That's how we have the final final
results. Hopefully that's not our.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6152-0
00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:20.208
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6158-0
00:52:30.758 --> 00:52:32.198
<v Hou, Eric>There is no question, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6171-0
00:52:34.008 --> 00:52:37.768
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just show you the codes that could
do this random forest for us.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6176-0
00:52:39.808 --> 00:52:41.928
<v Hou, Eric>Let me restart this call space.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6179-0
00:52:44.448 --> 00:52:45.488
<v Hou, Eric>To share my screen.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6182-0
00:52:47.168 --> 00:52:48.128
<v Hou, Eric>So that you can see it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6186-0
00:53:08.068 --> 00:53:08.828
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe. Sure.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6194-0
00:53:13.348 --> 00:53:16.148
<v Hou, Eric>So those are tree models,
and then we've seen.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6202-0
00:53:22.328 --> 00:53:24.528
<v Hou, Eric>This is the one example we've seen as
well.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6210-0
00:53:30.538 --> 00:53:33.018
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
this is one example we have seen as well.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6212-0
00:53:38.238 --> 00:53:38.798
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6214-0
00:53:40.328 --> 00:53:40.648
<v Hou, Eric>So this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6229-0
00:53:42.328 --> 00:53:46.768
<v Hou, Eric>Piece of code we're showing like how
bootstrapping is is is working right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6241-0
00:53:46.768 --> 00:53:52.088
<v Hou, Eric>So then we're still using the same data,
generating the same data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6267-0
00:53:52.088 --> 00:53:56.221
<v Hou, Eric>How size number bedrooms and year view
then and house price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6267-1
00:53:56.221 --> 00:54:01.709
<v Hou, Eric>You can find these piece of code before.
So I'm using the same data set right so</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6267-2
00:54:01.709 --> 00:54:02.048
<v Hou, Eric>then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6289-0
00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:13.278
<v Hou, Eric>I'm really I do want to create 33 data
set from randomly selecting from this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6289-1
00:54:13.278 --> 00:54:15.188
<v Hou, Eric>original data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6292-0
00:54:15.628 --> 00:54:17.748
<v Hou, Eric>So I said I need 3 samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6295-0
00:54:18.228 --> 00:54:19.828
<v Hou, Eric>So then I create.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6306-0
00:54:21.488 --> 00:54:24.808
<v Hou, Eric>Three samples from bootstrapping doing
this way.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6311-0
00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:30.312
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
so then I can actually see those samples,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6311-1
00:54:30.312 --> 00:54:30.608
<v Hou, Eric>so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6313-0
00:54:33.718 --> 00:54:33.758
<v Hou, Eric>0.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6337-0
00:54:33.758 --> 00:54:39.365
<v Hou, Eric>This is the original data set that looks
like this through the bootstrapping.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6337-1
00:54:39.365 --> 00:54:43.318
<v Hou, Eric>I have this data set,
one data set two and data set 3.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6341-0
00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:46.998
<v Hou, Eric>The one,
the ones that I show in the slides, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6352-0
00:54:48.648 --> 00:54:51.648
<v Hou, Eric>The next step is I just need to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6374-0
00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:57.756
<v Hou, Eric>I can really build a random forest
regressor and then that is something</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6374-1
00:54:57.756 --> 00:55:03.528
<v Hou, Eric>you'll be doing is you do not have to
recreate those bootstrapping samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6379-0
00:55:04.158 --> 00:55:05.958
<v Hou, Eric>You can simply call.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6387-0
00:55:07.528 --> 00:55:09.288
<v Hou, Eric>Random Forest regressor and that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6406-0
00:55:09.288 --> 00:55:14.614
<v Hou, Eric>And until the number of features and the
Max features and these kind of parameters,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6406-1
00:55:14.614 --> 00:55:15.248
<v Hou, Eric>that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6416-0
00:55:15.728 --> 00:55:21.488
<v Hou, Eric>But what I'm trying to show is I am doing
this on single X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6434-0
00:55:24.328 --> 00:55:28.310
<v Hou, Eric>Train.
So then I want to show you what's the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6434-1
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:34.768
<v Hou, Eric>single decision tree, the tree,
one tree two and Tree 3 gonna look like.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6438-0
00:55:36.138 --> 00:55:38.298
<v Hou, Eric>Right, so I want to show that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6441-0
00:55:39.838 --> 00:55:41.478
<v Hou, Eric>In in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6458-0
00:55:45.598 --> 00:55:50.974
<v Hou, Eric>I want to show you the individual tree
prediction from each of them from each</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6458-1
00:55:50.974 --> 00:55:51.318
<v Hou, Eric>tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6459-0
00:55:51.678 --> 00:55:52.838
<v Hou, Eric>So this one is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6469-0
00:55:54.408 --> 00:55:57.328
<v Hou, Eric>A simple a single decision tree as
complex as that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6495-0
00:55:57.728 --> 00:56:03.599
<v Hou, Eric>But if you just doing this simple trees,
those are easier trees and then I can</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6495-1
00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:09.322
<v Hou, Eric>provide a prediction for tree one tree
two and Tree 3 based upon some data I</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6495-2
00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:10.288
<v Hou, Eric>just plug in.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6511-0
00:56:12.958 --> 00:56:18.158
<v Hou, Eric>The bagging is just basically I have the
predictions from different trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6513-0
00:56:18.198 --> 00:56:19.238
<v Hou, Eric>I just average them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6518-0
00:56:19.398 --> 00:56:22.758
<v Hou, Eric>So as simple as a mean function,
I average them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6525-0
00:56:23.408 --> 00:56:26.008
<v Hou, Eric>That's my final prediction, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6530-0
00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:28.368
<v Hou, Eric>And then I'm just showing you guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6542-0
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:33.268
<v Hou, Eric>What?
How good or bad those those decision</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6542-1
00:56:33.268 --> 00:56:35.288
<v Hou, Eric>trees are the single tree?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6552-0
00:56:37.568 --> 00:56:41.488
<v Hou, Eric>Is, is, is is this MSE the run before?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6568-0
00:56:41.488 --> 00:56:46.718
<v Hou, Eric>Is is this but for this very example,
that single tree is better,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6568-1
00:56:46.718 --> 00:56:49.808
<v Hou, Eric>but you know if we reach the number of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6570-0
00:56:52.688 --> 00:56:53.488
<v Hou, Eric>Samples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6579-0
00:56:53.918 --> 00:56:55.838
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you can definitely show.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6581-0
00:56:55.838 --> 00:56:57.558
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely see a much better
results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6584-0
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:00.728
<v Hou, Eric>That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6585-0
00:57:01.048 --> 00:57:02.248
<v Hou, Eric>So so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6593-0
00:57:08.388 --> 00:57:11.828
<v Hou, Eric>The the random forest is quite easy to
interpret.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6602-0
00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:24.278
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Any any question about random forest?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6611-0
00:57:25.848 --> 00:57:28.408
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully it's not hard to to digest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6613-0
00:57:30.558 --> 00:57:31.118
<v Hou, Eric>I'm bagging.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6649-0
00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:39.524
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
I will say that's let's take a 15 minute</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6649-1
00:57:39.524 --> 00:57:45.159
<v Hou, Eric>break because when we come back,
we're going to talk about boosting,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6649-2
00:57:45.159 --> 00:57:51.448
<v Hou, Eric>which is in my opinion a little bit more
complex than the the random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6658-0
00:57:51.528 --> 00:57:56.608
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we gonna have some real fun in
boosting, OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6669-0
00:57:56.928 --> 00:58:02.328
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll see you guys around 6:45 and then
we we were talking about.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6673-0
00:58:03.128 --> 00:58:04.968
<v Hou, Eric>Boosting will be like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6675-0
00:58:06.588 --> 00:58:06.988
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6677-0
00:58:08.768 --> 00:58:09.248
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Sounds good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6679-0
00:58:10.058 --> 00:58:10.538
<v Hou, Eric>Alright.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6813-0
01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:28.640
<v Hou, Eric>All right,
let's get the second-half of the class</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6813-1
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.028
<v Hou, Eric>started, right, so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6825-0
01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:36.768
<v Hou, Eric>We're really talking about the ensemble
method, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6832-0
01:13:36.768 --> 01:13:39.688
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have two major pieces of it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6834-0
01:13:39.688 --> 01:13:40.768
<v Hou, Eric>One is bagging.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6842-0
01:13:42.488 --> 01:13:45.848
<v Hou, Eric>That is basically bootstrapping bootstrap
aggregation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6846-0
01:13:47.848 --> 01:13:50.648
<v Hou, Eric>We have the original data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6853-0
01:13:52.408 --> 01:13:54.928
<v Hou, Eric>We run and we select a subset of the data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6871-0
01:13:55.838 --> 01:14:01.671
<v Hou, Eric>And we allow duplicator duplicate the
data in the new data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6871-1
01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.678
<v Hou, Eric>We can create a number of copies.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6877-0
01:14:06.248 --> 01:14:07.288
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely more than one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6879-0
01:14:07.288 --> 01:14:09.048
<v Hou, Eric>And then we build a tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6896-0
01:14:10.688 --> 01:14:14.208
<v Hou, Eric>Or or different independent classifiers
called independent classifier.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6912-0
01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:17.947
<v Hou, Eric>But it's really we're building different
trees on the different data and then</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6912-1
01:14:17.947 --> 01:14:19.768
<v Hou, Eric>eventually we aggregate data together.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6914-0
01:14:20.048 --> 01:14:20.848
<v Hou, Eric>That's call bagging.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6920-0
01:14:22.178 --> 01:14:23.938
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then we just create something for</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6920-1
01:14:23.938 --> 01:14:24.338
<v Hou, Eric>ourselves.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6929-0
01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:29.478
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's sort of idea behind
backing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6963-0
01:14:31.048 --> 01:14:34.891
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry,
but boosting is totally different idea,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6963-1
01:14:34.891 --> 01:14:41.349
<v Hou, Eric>so boosting is will be relying on will be
rely on some weak classifier or weak</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6963-2
01:14:41.349 --> 01:14:42.248
<v Hou, Eric>regressors.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6982-0
01:14:42.648 --> 01:14:46.932
<v Hou, Eric>Basically very simple trees.
We hope to make use of those,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6982-1
01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:51.288
<v Hou, Eric>at least of a simple trees based upon the
same set of data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6990-0
01:14:51.768 --> 01:14:54.928
<v Hou, Eric>So we are not dealing,
we are not doing anything around the data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/6997-0
01:14:55.278 --> 01:14:56.118
<v Hou, Eric>They're building trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7011-0
01:14:56.118 --> 01:15:00.923
<v Hou, Eric>We're going to build a list of trees and
then we can hope that the list of trees</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7011-1
01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:03.118
<v Hou, Eric>based upon the same data can help us.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7015-0
01:15:03.118 --> 01:15:04.798
<v Hou, Eric>Uh. With different insights.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7033-0
01:15:04.798 --> 01:15:09.029
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can learn from the different
trees, and then we can have accurate,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7033-1
01:15:09.029 --> 01:15:11.198
<v Hou, Eric>more accurate, more accurate prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7035-0
01:15:11.998 --> 01:15:14.598
<v Hou, Eric>So backing is more data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7038-0
01:15:16.128 --> 01:15:16.888
<v Hou, Eric>We're creating more data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7054-0
01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:26.285
<v Hou, Eric>And and boosting is we're creating
multiple we classifier meaning we are</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7054-1
01:15:26.285 --> 01:15:28.048
<v Hou, Eric>creating more trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7061-0
01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:30.638
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, more different.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7065-0
01:15:30.638 --> 01:15:32.958
<v Hou, Eric>Uh. Simple trees? Umm.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7072-0
01:15:33.798 --> 01:15:37.718
<v Hou, Eric>So the first example we'll be seeing is
called ADA Boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7085-0
01:15:39.818 --> 01:15:45.200
<v Hou, Eric>So Adopost is really the name of ADA.
Boost is coming from additive adaptive</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7085-1
01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.458
<v Hou, Eric>adaptive boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7090-0
01:15:47.738 --> 01:15:48.818
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the idea.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7100-0
01:15:48.818 --> 01:15:54.018
<v Hou, Eric>And then here is the steps of this ADA
boost algorithm.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7110-0
01:15:54.658 --> 01:16:01.618
<v Hou, Eric>So it looks like really difficult,
I will say, but we'll go step stepwise.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7119-0
01:16:01.618 --> 01:16:04.093
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
you'll see it is not actually very</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7119-1
01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.138
<v Hou, Eric>difficult and then?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7135-0
01:16:07.328 --> 01:16:13.776
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of I would say once I read those
computer science or machine learning</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7135-1
01:16:13.776 --> 01:16:15.048
<v Hou, Eric>articles right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7143-0
01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:18.728
<v Hou, Eric>So then they always gonna give you a lot
of really fancy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7153-0
01:16:21.238 --> 01:16:26.878
<v Hou, Eric>Formula like this,
but they're really not though as fancy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7186-0
01:16:26.878 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Hou, Eric>So then you just need to go stepwise.
You understand what this tree is building</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7186-1
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:36.187
<v Hou, Eric>and and then after you you figured out
what each step is doing,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7186-2
01:16:36.187 --> 01:16:40.518
<v Hou, Eric>you figured out the idea how they
invented this kind of structure.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7190-0
01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:41.478
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7199-0
01:16:41.678 --> 01:16:44.678
<v Hou, Eric>So now let's just I'm not going to read
those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7203-0
01:16:44.678 --> 01:16:45.718
<v Hou, Eric>Step 1234.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7217-0
01:16:45.718 --> 01:16:51.151
<v Hou, Eric>Here and then we gonna go through every
single step and then hopefully I give you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7217-1
01:16:51.151 --> 01:16:52.078
<v Hou, Eric>some examples.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7227-0
01:16:52.078 --> 01:16:57.478
<v Hou, Eric>You you eventually feel that Adaboost is
so easy concept, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7231-0
01:17:04.098 --> 01:17:04.578
<v Hou, Eric>That's true.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7233-0
01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.218
<v Hou, Eric>Actually go from.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7244-0
01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:10.368
<v Hou, Eric>Let's this for this one.
That's just for raid.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7245-0
01:17:10.608 --> 01:17:11.168
<v Hou, Eric>This one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7254-0
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:14.512
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry,
I just this this one we we could actually</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7254-1
01:17:14.512 --> 01:17:15.808
<v Hou, Eric>go through this so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7264-0
01:17:17.568 --> 01:17:22.488
<v Hou, Eric>The first step to initialize wait so it
is sort of like.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7271-0
01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.088
<v Hou, Eric>A democracy, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7278-0
01:17:25.088 --> 01:17:30.928
<v Hou, Eric>So then in a democracy,
we are giving every single record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7280-0
01:17:32.318 --> 01:17:33.078
<v Hou, Eric>A equal weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7293-0
01:17:34.648 --> 01:17:38.224
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So no one left behind and no one is above</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7293-1
01:17:38.224 --> 01:17:38.808
<v Hou, Eric>the law.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7315-0
01:17:39.808 --> 01:17:43.824
<v Hou, Eric>So then every single record say you have
10 record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7315-1
01:17:43.824 --> 01:17:48.457
<v Hou, Eric>I will consider every single one has a
tenth of the weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7315-2
01:17:48.457 --> 01:17:50.928
<v Hou, Eric>So everyone has the same weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7316-0
01:17:51.608 --> 01:17:51.968
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7318-0
01:17:52.008 --> 01:17:53.448
<v Hou, Eric>So that's our starting point.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7322-0
01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:55.768
<v Hou, Eric>Everyone is equal.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7339-0
01:17:58.018 --> 01:18:04.446
<v Hou, Eric>And then and #2 starting Step 2 is we
gonna liter rate for trees what we are</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7339-1
01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:05.698
<v Hou, Eric>going to do is?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7347-0
01:18:07.248 --> 01:18:10.048
<v Hou, Eric>We're we're going to build a super simple
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7354-0
01:18:11.648 --> 01:18:12.488
<v Hou, Eric>That is called stump.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7356-0
01:18:12.808 --> 01:18:14.448
<v Hou, Eric>That's a really a tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7358-0
01:18:16.128 --> 01:18:17.008
<v Hou, Eric>With only.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7372-0
01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:23.128
<v Hou, Eric>A1 condition and a yes or no and they
have a prediction so-called stump right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7379-0
01:18:23.128 --> 01:18:25.648
<v Hou, Eric>So then we only build a super simple tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7381-0
01:18:25.648 --> 01:18:26.008
<v Hou, Eric>A stump.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7390-0
01:18:27.158 --> 01:18:30.798
<v Hou, Eric>And then we will have some classification
result.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7400-0
01:18:30.798 --> 01:18:33.518
<v Hou, Eric>And by the way,
this add boost is only for classification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7406-0
01:18:33.518 --> 01:18:36.438
<v Hou, Eric>So that that's why we are only talking
about classification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7411-0
01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.838
<v Hou, Eric>So then that stomp gonna give you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7414-0
01:18:41.688 --> 01:18:42.328
<v Hou, Eric>Some results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7421-0
01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:46.208
<v Hou, Eric>And and then you will calculate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7427-0
01:18:46.328 --> 01:18:49.888
<v Hou, Eric>You will calculate OK whether or not.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7435-0
01:18:51.688 --> 01:18:55.128
<v Hou, Eric>That storm is more right or more.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7441-0
01:18:56.768 --> 01:18:58.048
<v Hou, Eric>More correct or more incorrect?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7454-0
01:18:58.678 --> 01:19:01.998
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you calculate an error.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7460-0
01:19:02.038 --> 01:19:05.118
<v Hou, Eric>You can ignore how this one is defined.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7463-0
01:19:05.118 --> 01:19:05.918
<v Hou, Eric>You can just say OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7471-0
01:19:05.918 --> 01:19:09.958
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just going to calculate the error of
that that stump that simple tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7483-0
01:19:10.518 --> 01:19:14.638
<v Hou, Eric>So they say the error is 50% or say the
error is only 20%.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7489-0
01:19:14.638 --> 01:19:16.518
<v Hou, Eric>That means,
like the prediction is pretty accurate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7490-0
01:19:16.758 --> 01:19:17.238
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7505-0
01:19:17.598 --> 01:19:22.303
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will calculate the one thing
called amount of say you can just</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7505-1
01:19:22.303 --> 01:19:25.718
<v Hou, Eric>remember this,
you can just remember of this number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7510-0
01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.048
<v Hou, Eric>The concept of this is amount of say.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7515-0
01:19:29.128 --> 01:19:31.008
<v Hou, Eric>What does Amanda say mean?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7528-0
01:19:31.608 --> 01:19:36.248
<v Hou, Eric>So it is really coming from the idea that
if I know one person.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7558-0
01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:43.458
<v Hou, Eric>That usually is an expert in one area.
Then that person usually give you the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7558-1
01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:49.328
<v Hou, Eric>correct opinions that you know opinions
turns to be proven right in the future.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7572-0
01:19:49.568 --> 01:19:56.928
<v Hou, Eric>So I will trust that tree more than a
random person on the street, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7579-0
01:19:56.928 --> 01:20:01.408
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is idea is I I I I build a
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7586-0
01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:02.678
<v Hou, Eric>I build a storm.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7604-0
01:20:02.678 --> 01:20:10.830
<v Hou, Eric>I tasked it how accurate that storm is or
I I I I tasked it how accurate that tree</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7604-1
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.678
<v Hou, Eric>model is. So then based upon.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7614-0
01:20:15.248 --> 01:20:18.627
<v Hou, Eric>That model's error.
Are you gonna give that model a different</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7614-1
01:20:18.627 --> 01:20:19.008
<v Hou, Eric>weight?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7632-0
01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:26.967
<v Hou, Eric>The model may have a higher weight if
that model is usually give me the correct</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7632-1
01:20:26.967 --> 01:20:28.448
<v Hou, Eric>correct prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7638-0
01:20:28.968 --> 01:20:31.848
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if that model always give me wrong.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7645-0
01:20:32.158 --> 01:20:35.478
<v Hou, Eric>Prediction. I will keep that model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7661-0
01:20:36.968 --> 01:20:41.154
<v Hou, Eric>A lower weight,
so then you will have a model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7661-1
01:20:41.154 --> 01:20:46.408
<v Hou, Eric>One will have Model 2 and Model 3 and
Model 4 and Model 5.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7676-0
01:20:46.788 --> 01:20:51.707
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then I will test the accuracy of Model</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7676-1
01:20:51.707 --> 01:20:51.908
<v Hou, Eric>1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7678-0
01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:54.868
<v Hou, Eric>Say accuracy is good accuracy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7691-0
01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:03.418
<v Hou, Eric>It's good so that I'll give this guy a
great weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7694-0
01:21:03.898 --> 01:21:05.818
<v Hou, Eric>Accuracy is not so not so good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7703-0
01:21:05.938 --> 01:21:09.578
<v Hou, Eric>I will give this client not as big a
weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7707-0
01:21:10.018 --> 01:21:12.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7731-0
01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:17.343
<v Hou, Eric>I have a different so eventually
different models or different trees will</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7731-1
01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:20.578
<v Hou, Eric>have a different weight and a weight to
the end.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7735-0
01:21:20.578 --> 01:21:23.178
<v Hou, Eric>How we how I'm going to use this amount
of say.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7764-0
01:21:24.878 --> 01:21:29.068
<v Hou, Eric>But this,
this this let's have the first ever tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7764-1
01:21:29.068 --> 01:21:35.353
<v Hou, Eric>I calculate the first ever trees error
rate and then say that tree is doing a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7764-2
01:21:35.353 --> 01:21:36.078
<v Hou, Eric>good job.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7771-0
01:21:36.198 --> 01:21:40.198
<v Hou, Eric>I can assign a big amount of say to that
first ever tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7795-0
01:21:41.758 --> 01:21:46.963
<v Hou, Eric>The next step is I that first our tree
gonna still make some mistakes or</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7795-1
01:21:46.963 --> 01:21:51.598
<v Hou, Eric>misclassification meaning because it is
predict something wrong.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7810-0
01:21:53.278 --> 01:21:59.482
<v Hou, Eric>I want the second guy coming into this
place to help me correct the first guy's</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7810-1
01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:00.878
<v Hou, Eric>misclassification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7827-0
01:22:02.258 --> 01:22:08.824
<v Hou, Eric>The work I will ask the second guy or
second tree to do is I want the second</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7827-1
01:22:08.824 --> 01:22:10.018
<v Hou, Eric>tree to focus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7840-0
01:22:11.558 --> 01:22:16.398
<v Hou, Eric>The the result the wrong result more than
right result, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7846-0
01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:18.478
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have some misclassifications.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7867-0
01:22:18.798 --> 01:22:23.531
<v Hou, Eric>I have some correct classifications.
I want a second tree coming here to tell</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7867-1
01:22:23.531 --> 01:22:27.718
<v Hou, Eric>me to help me with those wrong
predictions or wrong classifications.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7874-0
01:22:28.038 --> 01:22:31.318
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'll give the wrong
classification more weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7890-0
01:22:32.498 --> 01:22:39.018
<v Hou, Eric>To come to the second guy's work,
then the correct predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7901-0
01:22:39.258 --> 01:22:44.538
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why we're doing some magic here
and to reassign a wait.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7914-0
01:22:44.538 --> 01:22:47.989
<v Hou, Eric>So now,
not every single person or every single</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7914-1
01:22:47.989 --> 01:22:50.218
<v Hou, Eric>role will have the same weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7915-0
01:22:50.618 --> 01:22:51.938
<v Hou, Eric>They have different weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7928-0
01:22:53.478 --> 01:22:55.998
<v Hou, Eric>The wrong predictions will have higher
weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7938-0
01:22:56.398 --> 01:23:00.851
<v Hou, Eric>The correct predictions will have lower
weight because they already have the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7938-1
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:01.718
<v Hou, Eric>correct answer.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7963-0
01:23:02.658 --> 01:23:09.480
<v Hou, Eric>I want the second guy focus on the wrong
predictions from the first guy and then I</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7963-1
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.178
<v Hou, Eric>want the third guy focus on the second
guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7968-0
01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:14.578
<v Hou, Eric>Wrong prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7979-0
01:23:14.818 --> 01:23:19.138
<v Hou, Eric>I want the fourth guy to focus on the
third guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7980-0
01:23:19.138 --> 01:23:20.018
<v Hou, Eric>Wrong predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7986-0
01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:24.858
<v Hou, Eric>And that's how we run this iteration, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7991-0
01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:27.058
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is we start from.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/7998-0
01:23:28.438 --> 01:23:30.638
<v Hou, Eric>Equally equally weighted.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8001-0
01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:32.718
<v Hou, Eric>Data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8022-0
01:23:34.188 --> 01:23:37.437
<v Hou, Eric>I hire a new person coming here and OK,
uh,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8022-1
01:23:37.437 --> 01:23:43.345
<v Hou, Eric>build your model and that person gonna
make some good results and some miss uh,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8022-2
01:23:43.345 --> 01:23:44.748
<v Hou, Eric>some wrong results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8045-0
01:23:45.268 --> 01:23:49.896
<v Hou, Eric>I want the second guy to focus on the
wrong result from the first guy when the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8045-1
01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:54.465
<v Hou, Eric>third guy focus on the wrong result from
the second guy and keep going right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8045-2
01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:55.988
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will judge each.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8053-0
01:23:57.998 --> 01:24:00.438
<v Hou, Eric>Guy's accuracy accuracy rate, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8061-0
01:24:00.438 --> 01:24:04.198
<v Hou, Eric>So the accuracy result if the first guy's
accuracy is pretty good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8080-0
01:24:05.058 --> 01:24:09.500
<v Hou, Eric>OK, that guy has a mount of, say,
higher than the second guy considering</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8080-1
01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.298
<v Hou, Eric>assuming the second guy has a lower
accuracy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8115-0
01:24:12.738 --> 01:24:17.886
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will eventually hire the best
people to help me make the decision in</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8115-1
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:21.144
<v Hou, Eric>the end,
and they have a higher amount of say and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8115-2
01:24:21.144 --> 01:24:25.574
<v Hou, Eric>it usually means make you know,
the folks are making like a mistake</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8115-3
01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:29.158
<v Hou, Eric>prediction.
They will have a lower amount of say that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8118-0
01:24:29.158 --> 01:24:29.618
<v Hou, Eric>How it works?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8121-0
01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:30.958
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8127-0
01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:33.838
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully it's it's not super hard
concept for you guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8136-0
01:24:35.178 --> 01:24:37.698
<v Hou, Eric>Do any any question yes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8152-0
01:24:36.068 --> 01:24:40.224
<v Benbenek, Matthew>So yeah,
do you final your final prediction is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8152-1
01:24:40.224 --> 01:24:42.788
<v Benbenek, Matthew>just your last tree you make.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8155-0
01:24:42.788 --> 01:24:45.388
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Then 'cause that'll hopefully be the best
one, no?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8193-0
01:24:43.628 --> 01:24:46.794
<v Hou, Eric>No, no, no,
because the the last one is only</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8193-1
01:24:46.794 --> 01:24:52.492
<v Hou, Eric>correcting the guy before the last one,
not necessarily the last one will be the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8193-2
01:24:52.492 --> 01:24:56.151
<v Hou, Eric>best guy,
but I eventually have all the guys coming</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8193-3
01:24:56.151 --> 01:25:01.497
<v Hou, Eric>together and then since they have a
different amount of say they gonna tell</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8193-4
01:25:01.497 --> 01:25:01.708
<v Hou, Eric>me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8221-0
01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:06.699
<v Hou, Eric>Their prediction based upon a new case
and and I I gonna group them together a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8221-1
01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:11.689
<v Hou, Eric>group them separately into different
groups and one says OK we should be doing</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8221-2
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:13.268
<v Hou, Eric>this. Another group says.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8241-0
01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:17.667
<v Hou, Eric>We should not be doing this,
but the guys in we should be doing this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8241-1
01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:22.308
<v Hou, Eric>group they if those guys have higher
amount of say I gonna trust those guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8254-0
01:25:25.738 --> 01:25:28.698
<v Hou, Eric>I will show you one example hopefully and
you know you understand, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8255-0
01:25:27.468 --> 01:25:27.988
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Oh, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8257-0
01:25:28.698 --> 01:25:29.738
<v Hou, Eric>I'll show you one example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8262-0
01:25:31.278 --> 01:25:31.718
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8266-0
01:25:32.278 --> 01:25:35.038
<v Hou, Eric>Any other questions before we move to to
examples?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8269-0
01:25:38.378 --> 01:25:38.538
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8271-0
01:25:38.538 --> 01:25:39.578
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe example should help.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8282-0
01:25:41.078 --> 01:25:42.558
<v Hou, Eric>This error rate versus amount of say
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8294-0
01:25:42.558 --> 01:25:45.839
<v Hou, Eric>So now you have a higher you have higher
error rate,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8294-1
01:25:45.839 --> 01:25:47.758
<v Hou, Eric>you have a lower amount of say.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8296-0
01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:49.438
<v Hou, Eric>Because.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8315-0
01:25:51.038 --> 01:25:55.201
<v Hou, Eric>You're you're proving you're giving wrong
predictions before, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8315-1
01:25:55.201 --> 01:25:58.398
<v Hou, Eric>And the amount say in here is also called
alpha. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8319-0
01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:00.518
<v Hou, Eric>Let's start with this example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8322-0
01:26:01.158 --> 01:26:02.758
<v Hou, Eric>So now we are applying to predict.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8329-0
01:26:04.478 --> 01:26:07.918
<v Hou, Eric>A default action from those guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8335-0
01:26:08.668 --> 01:26:10.068
<v Hou, Eric>And we have the age.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8358-0
01:26:10.228 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Hou, Eric>We have the income of those people and
then we have a one or zero,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8358-1
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.708
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not their their student.
We have a credit rate, whether.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8389-0
01:26:19.718 --> 01:26:24.027
<v Hou, Eric>Whether they're higher than threshold or
lower than threshold, and then it just,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8389-1
01:26:24.027 --> 01:26:28.390
<v Hou, Eric>you know, just wanted to make, you know,
one associate with default equal to ones</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8389-2
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:30.358
<v Hou, Eric>because one means they're defaulting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8402-0
01:26:30.358 --> 01:26:35.749
<v Hou, Eric>So then usually people default or default
their debt or default their credit card.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8402-1
01:26:35.749 --> 01:26:37.438
<v Hou, Eric>They are relatively lower.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8410-0
01:26:37.988 --> 01:26:38.788
<v Hou, Eric>Quite a rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8418-0
01:26:38.988 --> 01:26:42.508
<v Hou, Eric>So then there is a there is a strange
definition.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8456-0
01:26:42.508 --> 01:26:45.287
<v Hou, Eric>That is when when credit rate equal to
one,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8456-1
01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:48.508
<v Hou, Eric>that means they are actually lower than
threshold,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8456-2
01:26:48.508 --> 01:26:53.687
<v Hou, Eric>meaning they have more risk to to default
and who the guys with zero credit rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8456-3
01:26:53.687 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Hou, Eric>So then they are they are they are
actually higher than threshold that means</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8456-4
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:59.308
<v Hou, Eric>they have a.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8464-0
01:26:59.308 --> 01:27:00.188
<v Hou, Eric>Lower risk to default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8471-0
01:27:00.188 --> 01:27:03.948
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is really counter intuitive,
but these you know how I define this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8496-0
01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:07.245
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then that means like A1 when you have</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8496-1
01:27:07.245 --> 01:27:11.885
<v Hou, Eric>A1 incorreed and then that person may
default easier may have a higher</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8496-2
01:27:11.885 --> 01:27:13.388
<v Hou, Eric>probability to default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8512-0
01:27:13.388 --> 01:27:19.058
<v Hou, Eric>So now I just wanna have this one and 0
positively correlated with this default</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8512-1
01:27:19.058 --> 01:27:19.908
<v Hou, Eric>fact, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8530-0
01:27:20.388 --> 01:27:28.748
<v Hou, Eric>So the first step is since I have 10
records 1212345678910, I have 10 records.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8540-0
01:27:29.598 --> 01:27:32.398
<v Hou, Eric>So the first ever ever step I gonna
assign.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8550-0
01:27:33.028 --> 01:27:38.028
<v Hou, Eric>The same way to each record,
so 1 / 10 one over 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8557-0
01:27:38.108 --> 01:27:40.188
<v Hou, Eric>I have 1 / 10 OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8561-0
01:27:41.028 --> 01:27:45.228
<v Hou, Eric>So then I/O will build a first stump.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8575-0
01:27:46.798 --> 01:27:49.038
<v Hou, Eric>It's really a tree like this.
You have a yes or no.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8578-0
01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:51.198
<v Hou, Eric>You have two leaves. That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8601-0
01:27:51.838 --> 01:27:57.835
<v Hou, Eric>There's a very simple tree, so I will say,
OK, income less than 90,000 if this a yes,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8601-1
01:27:57.835 --> 01:28:02.158
<v Hou, Eric>I will say those are the guys will
default if this is a null.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8626-0
01:28:02.708 --> 01:28:08.147
<v Hou, Eric>And those are the guys will not default,
meaning I am believing in if you there's</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8626-1
01:28:08.147 --> 01:28:11.464
<v Hou, Eric>a one guy,
if one guy in joining a higher income,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8626-2
01:28:11.464 --> 01:28:13.188
<v Hou, Eric>that guy will not default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8634-0
01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:15.348
<v Hou, Eric>That's basically the idea of building
this tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8637-0
01:28:16.108 --> 01:28:17.268
<v Hou, Eric>Makes sense, not makes sense.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8646-0
01:28:17.268 --> 01:28:20.868
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know,
but I see how good this decision tree is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8661-0
01:28:21.548 --> 01:28:28.108
<v Hou, Eric>So if one person has income lower than 90,
000, OK, this guy is lower than 90,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8667-0
01:28:28.918 --> 01:28:29.598
<v Hou, Eric>This guy default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8671-0
01:28:30.198 --> 01:28:31.998
<v Hou, Eric>This guy lower than 90,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8673-0
01:28:31.998 --> 01:28:32.958
<v Hou, Eric>This guy default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8679-0
01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.248
<v Hou, Eric>This guy lower than 90,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8689-0
01:28:35.248 --> 01:28:39.888
<v Hou, Eric>This guy also default this guy lower than
90,000, but this guy didn't default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8706-0
01:28:41.598 --> 01:28:45.109
<v Hou, Eric>And this guy, lower 90,000,
this guy default. I'm correct.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8706-1
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:46.478
<v Hou, Eric>Four out of five times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8713-0
01:28:48.678 --> 01:28:49.638
<v Hou, Eric>Right, so I'm correct.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8728-0
01:28:49.638 --> 01:28:52.998
<v Hou, Eric>Four out of five times.
And I'm saying the, the, the,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8728-1
01:28:52.998 --> 01:28:56.918
<v Hou, Eric>the folks earn more than 90,000,
they're not going to default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8740-0
01:28:57.558 --> 01:28:59.817
<v Hou, Eric>Well,
I'm wrong here because this guy earned</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8740-1
01:28:59.817 --> 01:29:02.678
<v Hou, Eric>more than 90,
000 this ID about this guy didn't default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8741-0
01:29:02.678 --> 01:29:03.078
<v Hou, Eric>I'm sorry.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8750-0
01:29:03.848 --> 01:29:06.488
<v Hou, Eric>This guy didn't default,
which is as expected.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8751-0
01:29:06.488 --> 01:29:07.448
<v Hou, Eric>I'm correct?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8770-0
01:29:07.808 --> 01:29:14.191
<v Hou, Eric>I'm correct here because I say this is
the guy who earned money. More than 90,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8770-1
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:15.888
<v Hou, Eric>000 will not default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8779-0
01:29:15.888 --> 01:29:19.328
<v Hou, Eric>And then this guy earned more than 90,
000 and didn't default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8781-0
01:29:19.328 --> 01:29:20.008
<v Hou, Eric>I'm correct here?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8787-0
01:29:21.558 --> 01:29:22.358
<v Hou, Eric>I am correct here?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8788-0
01:29:23.118 --> 01:29:24.358
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not correct here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8795-0
01:29:25.998 --> 01:29:27.278
<v Hou, Eric>I am correct here?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8799-0
01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:29.118
<v Hou, Eric>I am not correct here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8800-0
01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:30.118
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8806-0
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.078
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm correct three times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8808-0
01:29:32.358 --> 01:29:33.278
<v Hou, Eric>Three out of five.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8815-0
01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.988
<v Hou, Eric>So this is my first ever decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8821-0
01:29:37.558 --> 01:29:39.398
<v Hou, Eric>Where did I do something wrong?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8827-0
01:29:39.438 --> 01:29:42.598
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then we did this record wrong.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8833-0
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:46.438
<v Hou, Eric>Remember this one 94,820?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8857-0
01:29:48.518 --> 01:29:57.958
<v Hou, Eric>I did this record wrong 30,
769 and I did this record wrong 94,925.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8860-0
01:29:59.508 --> 01:30:01.868
<v Hou, Eric>My first tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8873-0
01:30:03.438 --> 01:30:08.718
<v Hou, Eric>Has all seven cracked prediction and
three of them were wrong.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8874-0
01:30:09.318 --> 01:30:09.958
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8877-0
01:30:10.558 --> 01:30:12.078
<v Hou, Eric>All those seven are correct.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8880-0
01:30:12.078 --> 01:30:13.838
<v Hou, Eric>All those three are wrong.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8882-0
01:30:14.078 --> 01:30:15.198
<v Hou, Eric>So then my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8885-0
01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:18.398
<v Hou, Eric>Weighted error is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8897-0
01:30:20.078 --> 01:30:24.958
<v Hou, Eric>This wrong versus one out of 10 weight
this wrong worth it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8907-0
01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:28.518
<v Hou, Eric>One of ten rate this wrong versus one of
ten rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8911-0
01:30:28.718 --> 01:30:31.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then my weighted error is this .3.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8925-0
01:30:33.668 --> 01:30:36.754
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
amount of say I am going to plug in this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8925-1
01:30:36.754 --> 01:30:38.948
<v Hou, Eric>point of three into the formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8954-0
01:30:40.098 --> 01:30:45.290
<v Hou, Eric>Into this super complex formula and I
just plug in .</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8954-1
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:52.832
<v Hou, Eric>3 here I have this amount of say meaning
I have 30% of error and then I have</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8954-2
01:30:52.832 --> 01:30:57.338
<v Hou, Eric>slightly higher than 30% of amount of say
OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8973-0
01:30:57.338 --> 01:31:03.287
<v Hou, Eric>I will keep this number in my memory and
I know the first tree 30% wrong and the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8973-1
01:31:03.287 --> 01:31:05.858
<v Hou, Eric>fortyttwo percent amount of say OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8975-0
01:31:06.668 --> 01:31:06.828
<v Hou, Eric>Now.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8980-0
01:31:08.428 --> 01:31:09.748
<v Hou, Eric>What I will be doing is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8998-0
01:31:10.378 --> 01:31:14.058
<v Hou, Eric>For the second guy to come into this
project,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/8998-1
01:31:14.058 --> 01:31:20.058
<v Hou, Eric>I want the second guy to focus on this
record this record and this record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9019-0
01:31:20.988 --> 01:31:26.070
<v Hou, Eric>If the second guy can crack those 3
records and give me right answer, OK,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9019-1
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:28.268
<v Hou, Eric>I think I'm getting there right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9029-0
01:31:28.268 --> 01:31:33.068
<v Hou, Eric>I'm getting to a perfect answer,
so then I will.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9047-0
01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:40.795
<v Hou, Eric>I will plug in a the this amount of say
into the formula in this update</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9047-1
01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:43.348
<v Hou, Eric>observation weights you do.</v>

01:31:43.348 --> 01:31:44.788
<v Hou, Eric>You can remember this formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9060-0
01:31:44.788 --> 01:31:48.877
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have to remember this formula.
What this formula is really telling you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9060-1
01:31:48.877 --> 01:31:49.028
<v Hou, Eric>is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9067-0
01:31:49.828 --> 01:31:51.988
<v Hou, Eric>For the right predictions for those right
ones.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9099-0
01:31:53.028 --> 01:31:59.015
<v Hou, Eric>A new weight will be much smaller than
110, so right now it's only 6.54%,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9099-1
01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:04.275
<v Hou, Eric>but for the wrong ones.
I'm going to increase the weight because</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9099-2
01:32:04.275 --> 01:32:07.268
<v Hou, Eric>I want the second guy coming in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9104-0
01:32:07.268 --> 01:32:09.228
<v Hou, Eric>Focus on those wrong predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9115-0
01:32:09.708 --> 01:32:12.948
<v Hou, Eric>So for those guys,
it will be 15% of weight.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9119-0
01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:16.828
<v Hou, Eric>I have 50% increase from 10%, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9134-0
01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:22.428
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then one issue you'll find
is you add up those weight together.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9137-0
01:32:23.468 --> 01:32:24.708
<v Hou, Eric>They do not equal to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9160-0
01:32:25.938 --> 01:32:31.315
<v Hou, Eric>So that you have to renormalize it.
Then renormalization is your original way,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9160-1
01:32:31.315 --> 01:32:34.378
<v Hou, Eric>divided by the summation of those total
way.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9188-0
01:32:34.658 --> 01:32:42.488
<v Hou, Eric>And then eventually it re normalize the
way of those right answers are 7% per SE</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9188-1
01:32:42.488 --> 01:32:46.258
<v Hou, Eric>and for those wrong answers are 17% OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9196-0
01:32:46.458 --> 01:32:51.298
<v Hou, Eric>So now I have totally different weight to
the right answers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9203-0
01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:54.908
<v Hou, Eric>And wrong answers from the first ever
tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9208-0
01:32:55.298 --> 01:32:57.658
<v Hou, Eric>Or first ever guy we hired, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9253-0
01:32:59.228 --> 01:33:04.862
<v Hou, Eric>So the next time is a little bit tricky
and the next step is I how I'm going to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9253-1
01:33:04.862 --> 01:33:10.495
<v Hou, Eric>use this weight to create some data for
the for the second guy to learn is this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9253-2
01:33:10.495 --> 01:33:15.988
<v Hou, Eric>is really a computer science technique.
I create a data range so this number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9271-0
01:33:16.028 --> 01:33:22.289
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna go from zero to this number and
this number gonna from the end of this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9271-1
01:33:22.289 --> 01:33:24.428
<v Hou, Eric>interval to plus this with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9286-0
01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:30.378
<v Hou, Eric>So eventually you're seeing this is one
time of 7% and 2 * 3 * 4 times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9303-0
01:33:31.948 --> 01:33:34.276
<v Hou, Eric>Five times and then I'll be adding this
number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9303-1
01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:37.428
<v Hou, Eric>I'll be adding this number to here to
make this interval larger.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9315-0
01:33:39.098 --> 01:33:45.418
<v Hou, Eric>I you eventually this this range data
range kinda from zero to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9362-0
01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:48.581
<v Hou, Eric>I mean this is rounding error for for
sure,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9362-1
01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:54.618
<v Hou, Eric>but when you see when you but as you can
see whenever we have a bigger weight here,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9362-2
01:33:54.618 --> 01:34:00.224
<v Hou, Eric>this data range is a little bit wider
than the original right answers because</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9362-3
01:34:00.224 --> 01:34:03.458
<v Hou, Eric>the right answers you have the the width
of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9368-0
01:34:03.458 --> 01:34:05.618
<v Hou, Eric>This sub interval .07.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9374-0
01:34:06.428 --> 01:34:08.828
<v Hou, Eric>But for the wrong answers, the with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9385-0
01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:12.698
<v Hou, Eric>Of this data range is really .1667.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9389-0
01:34:12.698 --> 01:34:13.938
<v Hou, Eric>So that's wide.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9401-0
01:34:14.538 --> 01:34:21.338
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will ask the computer to
generate a random number, let's say .5.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9414-0
01:34:22.908 --> 01:34:26.668
<v Hou, Eric>From this data range, you know .
5 lives in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9429-0
01:34:27.188 --> 01:34:33.388
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely bigger than .
357 and lower than .5 to 37.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9436-0
01:34:33.628 --> 01:34:38.434
<v Hou, Eric>So then this data,
this very role got selected for the input</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9436-1
01:34:38.434 --> 01:34:38.828
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9448-0
01:34:39.818 --> 01:34:42.938
<v Hou, Eric>And it goes like it to the input data for
the second guy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9483-0
01:34:43.738 --> 01:34:50.200
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say if I generate .
7 which guy which which record will be</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9483-1
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:55.072
<v Hou, Eric>select?
If we generate a random numbers point 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9483-2
01:34:55.072 --> 01:35:00.738
<v Hou, Eric>7 is is here and bigger than .
6904 and less than .7618?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9495-0
01:35:02.308 --> 01:35:07.108
<v Hou, Eric>So this record got selected to create an
input data for the second tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9499-0
01:35:09.198 --> 01:35:10.958
<v Hou, Eric>Why are we doing this?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9510-0
01:35:10.998 --> 01:35:16.478
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is you can regenerate any
number from zero to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9522-0
01:35:18.308 --> 01:35:23.308
<v Hou, Eric>But we have higher width of those data
range for the wrong answers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9535-0
01:35:23.308 --> 01:35:28.234
<v Hou, Eric>That means the wrong predictions have a
higher chance to be selected in the new</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9535-1
01:35:28.234 --> 01:35:28.788
<v Hou, Eric>data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9556-0
01:35:29.188 --> 01:35:34.457
<v Hou, Eric>We're still doing random selection here,
but just because we are putting more</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9556-1
01:35:34.457 --> 01:35:39.388
<v Hou, Eric>weight on the wrong answers so they have
a higher chance to be selected.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9571-0
01:35:40.228 --> 01:35:44.330
<v Hou, Eric>O then after this rogress or this
selection,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9571-1
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:49.708
<v Hou, Eric>the new data set going to look like this
we selected this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9598-0
01:35:50.218 --> 01:35:56.448
<v Hou, Eric>And this and this three times from this
random number generation and we select</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9598-1
01:35:56.448 --> 01:36:02.363
<v Hou, Eric>this and this two times and we also
select this guy and this guy twice and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9598-2
01:36:02.363 --> 01:36:04.098
<v Hou, Eric>this guy and this guy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9609-0
01:36:04.498 --> 01:36:10.728
<v Hou, Eric>So this 94820,
that is the one we generated wrong</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9609-1
01:36:10.728 --> 01:36:12.098
<v Hou, Eric>prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9619-0
01:36:13.628 --> 01:36:15.457
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then we actually selected three times</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9619-1
01:36:15.457 --> 01:36:16.828
<v Hou, Eric>through the random number selection.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9629-0
01:36:18.218 --> 01:36:22.818
<v Hou, Eric>What we're going to do is still now we
have a new data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9638-0
01:36:23.448 --> 01:36:27.968
<v Hou, Eric>We have three of them representing the
same wrong prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9651-0
01:36:28.448 --> 01:36:34.888
<v Hou, Eric>We still gonna assign everyone the equal
weight, but you have to know in your mind.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9654-0
01:36:36.388 --> 01:36:36.988
<v Hou, Eric>They are not actually equal.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9675-0
01:36:38.018 --> 01:36:41.763
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
we have 10 rows of data and each row of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9675-1
01:36:41.763 --> 01:36:45.258
<v Hou, Eric>data has the same weight as the other row.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9688-0
01:36:45.898 --> 01:36:49.765
<v Hou, Eric>However,
there are three rows of data representing</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9688-1
01:36:49.765 --> 01:36:50.978
<v Hou, Eric>the same record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9698-0
01:36:50.978 --> 01:36:55.778
<v Hou, Eric>That means that record has 30% of a
weight compared to the other record.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9715-0
01:36:56.338 --> 01:37:01.155
<v Hou, Eric>So then we are really focusing on that
wrong answer from the first guy and for</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9715-1
01:37:01.155 --> 01:37:02.618
<v Hou, Eric>the second guy to learn.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9719-0
01:37:03.468 --> 01:37:03.948
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9727-0
01:37:04.268 --> 01:37:08.748
<v Hou, Eric>So the second guy will definitely do this
guy, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9744-0
01:37:09.618 --> 01:37:13.076
<v Hou, Eric>And hopefully if that guy didn't get
everything right and something still</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9744-1
01:37:13.076 --> 01:37:14.618
<v Hou, Eric>wrong, then we can go from there.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9784-0
01:37:16.188 --> 01:37:21.330
<v Hou, Eric>So the second guy gonna predict this and
then got something right and something</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9784-1
01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:24.479
<v Hou, Eric>wrong.
And then we gonna calculate the amount of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9784-2
01:37:24.479 --> 01:37:29.235
<v Hou, Eric>save for the second guy and put a
different weight on the right and wrong</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9784-3
01:37:29.235 --> 01:37:33.348
<v Hou, Eric>answers and then create input data for
the third guy. So event.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9791-0
01:37:33.468 --> 01:37:36.788
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say we have 5 trees, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9793-0
01:37:36.988 --> 01:37:37.868
<v Hou, Eric>The five trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9824-0
01:37:38.808 --> 01:37:42.152
<v Hou, Eric>And First Tree is definitely the one
we've shown.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9824-1
01:37:42.152 --> 01:37:47.502
<v Hou, Eric>The second tree is based upon the data
coming from the first tree and the third</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9824-2
01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:51.648
<v Hou, Eric>tree is tree based upon the data coming
from the second tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9852-0
01:37:52.048 --> 01:37:56.482
<v Hou, Eric>Focus on the wrong predictions from
Second Tree and 4th Tree is a focus on</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9852-1
01:37:56.482 --> 01:38:01.094
<v Hou, Eric>the wrong prediction from the Third Tree
and 5th tree is focused on the wrong</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9852-2
01:38:01.094 --> 01:38:02.808
<v Hou, Eric>prediction from the 5th tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9853-0
01:38:02.808 --> 01:38:04.048
<v Hou, Eric>That's exactly the case.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9858-0
01:38:06.308 --> 01:38:07.628
<v Hou, Eric>Matt, you're talking about, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9870-0
01:38:08.538 --> 01:38:13.938
<v Hou, Eric>So now for each tree we have a month of
say.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9877-0
01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:19.278
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say those are the guys.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9889-0
01:38:19.398 --> 01:38:26.558
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the guys predicting a new case,
not person will not default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9900-0
01:38:27.238 --> 01:38:32.854
<v Hou, Eric>And those are the guys predicting,
predicting a new case coming in.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9900-1
01:38:32.854 --> 01:38:34.918
<v Hou, Eric>That person will default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9924-0
01:38:36.468 --> 01:38:39.877
<v Hou, Eric>So from a tree number per say,
I have 3 versus 2,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9924-1
01:38:39.877 --> 01:38:44.308
<v Hou, Eric>but that's not fair because some of the
trees are more accurate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9927-0
01:38:44.468 --> 01:38:46.308
<v Hou, Eric>Some of the trees are less accurate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9938-0
01:38:46.908 --> 01:38:50.548
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will be using this amount of
say to judge.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9953-0
01:38:52.108 --> 01:38:56.074
<v Hou, Eric>1.
5208 amount of say saying that that</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9953-1
01:38:56.074 --> 01:38:58.108
<v Hou, Eric>person will default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9972-0
01:38:59.868 --> 01:39:06.219
<v Hou, Eric>And only less than 50% of amount of say
saying that that person will default will</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9972-1
01:39:06.219 --> 01:39:07.148
<v Hou, Eric>not default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9976-0
01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.228
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will be trusting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9988-0
01:39:09.228 --> 01:39:14.607
<v Hou, Eric>I will be trusting this group then that
group because this group are this group</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9988-1
01:39:14.607 --> 01:39:15.548
<v Hou, Eric>consisting of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/9997-0
01:39:17.018 --> 01:39:21.338
<v Hou, Eric>Trees that are usually more accurate than
the other group of trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10013-0
01:39:23.178 --> 01:39:29.458
<v Hou, Eric>And and that is how eventually you'll be
using the trees that that you have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10016-0
01:39:29.458 --> 01:39:30.938
<v Hou, Eric>You may have 5 trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10027-0
01:39:31.138 --> 01:39:34.924
<v Hou, Eric>You may have 10 trees,
but eventually you have a summation</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10027-1
01:39:34.924 --> 01:39:37.298
<v Hou, Eric>amount say and not going to tell you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10035-0
01:39:38.868 --> 01:39:41.268
<v Hou, Eric>Your final decision, Matt,
did I answer your question?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10040-0
01:39:42.888 --> 01:39:44.048
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10046-0
01:39:44.048 --> 01:39:46.128
<v Benbenek, Matthew>More clear now is one question.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10043-0
01:39:45.408 --> 01:39:45.768
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10052-0
01:39:46.128 --> 01:39:48.848
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Is every tree using the same rule?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10058-0
01:39:49.598 --> 01:39:51.118
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, error trees are using the same rule.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10060-0
01:39:51.818 --> 01:39:52.258
<v Benbenek, Matthew>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10075-0
01:39:52.668 --> 01:39:55.357
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
error tree is using same rule and then</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10075-1
01:39:55.357 --> 01:39:57.628
<v Hou, Eric>every tree is really like a yes or no.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10094-0
01:39:59.348 --> 01:40:03.557
<v Hou, Eric>And and yes, no, will be like yes,
default no do not default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10094-1
01:40:03.557 --> 01:40:06.748
<v Hou, Eric>That kind of really,
really easy trees stumps.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10097-0
01:40:14.348 --> 01:40:15.388
<v Hou, Eric>Any any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10100-0
01:40:17.068 --> 01:40:17.588
<v Hou, Eric>Add a.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10102-0
01:40:17.588 --> 01:40:17.948
<v Hou, Eric>Add a boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10115-0
01:40:21.808 --> 01:40:25.857
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Wait one more.
How do you choose if it's targeting the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10115-1
01:40:25.857 --> 01:40:26.888
<v Benbenek, Matthew>yes or the no?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10124-0
01:40:27.798 --> 01:40:29.918
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, you can just assign that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10127-0
01:40:30.068 --> 01:40:30.908
<v Benbenek, Matthew>OK, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10132-0
01:40:30.118 --> 01:40:32.678
<v Hou, Eric>It's you can say yes, will.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10136-0
01:40:32.678 --> 01:40:33.998
<v Hou, Eric>Not default, no will default.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10138-0
01:40:33.998 --> 01:40:34.678
<v Hou, Eric>That's totally fine.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10139-0
01:40:35.538 --> 01:40:35.978
<v Benbenek, Matthew>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10153-0
01:40:36.228 --> 01:40:40.068
<v Hou, Eric>You just define the role and then and
then the code will just.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10188-0
01:40:40.188 --> 01:40:45.290
<v Hou, Eric>There are some default values that if me
this condition will be yes or me this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10188-1
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:50.133
<v Hou, Eric>condition we know this is how we define
the one or zeros and then by those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10188-2
01:40:50.133 --> 01:40:55.364
<v Hou, Eric>definition you can control yes with yes
default or yes not default those kind of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10188-3
01:40:55.364 --> 01:40:56.268
<v Hou, Eric>those kind of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10195-0
01:40:58.678 --> 01:41:01.193
<v Hou, Eric>So really,
based upon your your definition of one or</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10195-1
01:41:01.193 --> 01:41:01.478
<v Hou, Eric>zeros.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10198-0
01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:08.848
<v Hou, Eric>Any any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10216-0
01:41:16.008 --> 01:41:22.631
<v Hou, Eric>So if if there's no question, right,
so then the highlight of this add a tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10216-1
01:41:22.631 --> 01:41:23.888
<v Hou, Eric>add a boost is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10222-0
01:41:25.428 --> 01:41:27.908
<v Hou, Eric>Number one, we have more than one trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10227-0
01:41:29.588 --> 01:41:31.748
<v Hou, Eric>So for from a you know.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10252-0
01:41:35.268 --> 01:41:37.695
<v Hou, Eric>From random Forest we have more than one
trees,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10252-1
01:41:37.695 --> 01:41:41.588
<v Hou, Eric>but from the tree models we have only one
tree dealing with the entire data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10255-0
01:41:41.988 --> 01:41:44.828
<v Hou, Eric>And now we have list of trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10274-0
01:41:46.228 --> 01:41:51.693
<v Hou, Eric>And then we have a list of simple trees,
because every single tree there's only</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10274-1
01:41:51.693 --> 01:41:55.108
<v Hou, Eric>one condition and a yes or No2 leaves.
That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10290-0
01:41:56.988 --> 01:42:00.702
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then,
unlike the random forest,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10290-1
01:42:00.702 --> 01:42:02.188
<v Hou, Eric>we're not dealing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10298-0
01:42:02.188 --> 01:42:05.308
<v Hou, Eric>All the trees are not dealing with the
same data anymore.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10317-0
01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:09.548
<v Hou, Eric>We build a first tree,
the second tree learning the run</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10317-1
01:42:09.548 --> 01:42:14.211
<v Hou, Eric>prediction of the first tree,
the third tree learning from learning</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10317-2
01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:14.828
<v Hou, Eric>from the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10327-0
01:42:15.178 --> 01:42:17.898
<v Hou, Eric>The the run predictions of the second
tree then keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10335-0
01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:22.578
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a sequential process for
random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10350-0
01:42:22.578 --> 01:42:27.647
<v Hou, Eric>Why a lot of people still like the random
forest is because that is a really a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10350-1
01:42:27.647 --> 01:42:28.738
<v Hou, Eric>parallel process.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10351-0
01:42:29.218 --> 01:42:29.858
<v Hou, Eric>You can.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10360-0
01:42:29.858 --> 01:42:33.058
<v Hou, Eric>You can convert 1 data set into a list of
data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10379-0
01:42:33.058 --> 01:42:38.504
<v Hou, Eric>It can be the different trees on top of
it, so that in case you have 100 trees,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10379-1
01:42:38.504 --> 01:42:40.138
<v Hou, Eric>you can train the trees.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10387-0
01:42:40.948 --> 01:42:42.628
<v Hou, Eric>Together at the same time.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10394-0
01:42:42.628 --> 01:42:45.588
<v Hou, Eric>Eventually you just need to aggregate all
the results.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10417-0
01:42:46.148 --> 01:42:49.345
<v Hou, Eric>So then every if you want to train 100
trees,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10417-1
01:42:49.345 --> 01:42:54.348
<v Hou, Eric>you just need to have 100 CPU and then
you can run it at the same time.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10422-0
01:42:55.228 --> 01:42:58.028
<v Hou, Eric>But for adapters you cannot.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10437-0
01:42:58.228 --> 01:43:02.308
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is a second tree has a
dependency on the first tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10453-0
01:43:02.588 --> 01:43:06.838
<v Hou, Eric>The third tree has dependency on the
second tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10453-1
01:43:06.838 --> 01:43:12.108
<v Hou, Eric>so the the number nth tree has a
dependency on north -1 tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10457-0
01:43:12.388 --> 01:43:13.548
<v Hou, Eric>So then you cannot.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10464-0
01:43:13.668 --> 01:43:15.788
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot enjoy parallel processing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10476-0
01:43:16.018 --> 01:43:20.018
<v Hou, Eric>You have to do this sequential
calculation, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10491-0
01:43:20.418 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Hou, Eric>But usually you have different expert and
correcting the previous trees mistakes</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10491-1
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:29.938
<v Hou, Eric>and then usually it could be accurate yes
or no.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10513-0
01:43:30.218 --> 01:43:33.402
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so the random forest and and and add a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10513-1
01:43:33.402 --> 01:43:38.178
<v Hou, Eric>boost are coming from a different mindset
and different thought, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10519-0
01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:41.018
<v Hou, Eric>So then. So that's why one is begging.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10521-0
01:43:41.018 --> 01:43:42.058
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10525-0
01:43:42.868 --> 01:43:43.308
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10531-0
01:43:44.028 --> 01:43:47.268
<v Hou, Eric>So add a boost is one method only for
classification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10537-0
01:43:47.698 --> 01:43:49.618
<v Hou, Eric>And then now we're thinking, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10547-0
01:43:49.618 --> 01:43:55.218
<v Hou, Eric>So we still have a large amount of
regression problems that we need to solve.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10577-0
01:43:56.788 --> 01:44:02.045
<v Hou, Eric>Can we learn from this andaboost idea and
create some regression algorithms and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10577-1
01:44:02.045 --> 01:44:07.500
<v Hou, Eric>then that will be a still a list of trees
for regression problems and turns out we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10577-2
01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.668
<v Hou, Eric>we can find those problems right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10590-0
01:44:10.108 --> 01:44:16.828
<v Hou, Eric>So let me show you one very important
concept that is called gradient gradient</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10590-1
01:44:16.828 --> 01:44:17.508
<v Hou, Eric>descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10593-0
01:44:19.418 --> 01:44:20.018
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10600-0
01:44:20.298 --> 01:44:23.538
<v Hou, Eric>So how important is grading in descendant
really is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10641-0
01:44:25.108 --> 01:44:29.805
<v Hou, Eric>When we talk about when we start talking
about the the neural network,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10641-1
01:44:29.805 --> 01:44:32.980
<v Hou, Eric>we're still talking about the gradient
descent,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10641-2
01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:36.155
<v Hou, Eric>the gradient boosting the gradient
descent, OK,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10641-3
01:44:36.155 --> 01:44:40.388
<v Hou, Eric>gradient descent is optimization
algorithm in machine learning.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10652-0
01:44:42.068 --> 01:44:45.348
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely the the official,
the official definition.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10661-0
01:44:45.348 --> 01:44:48.708
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna minimize the cost function.
I'll tell you what cost function is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10673-0
01:44:49.388 --> 01:44:51.708
<v Hou, Eric>By literatively updating the model
parameters.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10698-0
01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:55.041
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we can enjoy model parameters.
You always heard,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10698-1
01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:59.262
<v Hou, Eric>you know from opening I we use a billion
of parameters and now we're really</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10698-2
01:44:59.262 --> 01:45:01.428
<v Hou, Eric>talking about the parameters in models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10717-0
01:45:02.988 --> 01:45:05.837
<v Hou, Eric>And why use a training model such a
linear regression?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10717-1
01:45:05.837 --> 01:45:09.308
<v Hou, Eric>So pretty much all the models you can use
gradient descent, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10730-0
01:45:10.988 --> 01:45:16.268
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you one example that how we
actually using the gradient in descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10733-0
01:45:16.268 --> 01:45:18.908
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say we have the data. Why?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10752-0
01:45:19.178 --> 01:45:23.365
<v Hou, Eric>Equals 7 + 3 X and plus and the data
looks like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10752-1
01:45:23.365 --> 01:45:29.258
<v Hou, Eric>We already know the data looks like this.
We just need to find intercept 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10756-0
01:45:29.458 --> 01:45:31.178
<v Hou, Eric>And three, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10761-0
01:45:32.748 --> 01:45:33.868
<v Hou, Eric>How do we do that?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10766-0
01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:36.868
<v Hou, Eric>You guys can run a linear regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10772-0
01:45:37.228 --> 01:45:39.308
<v Hou, Eric>You can find a pretty accurate 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10786-0
01:45:39.388 --> 01:45:43.988
<v Hou, Eric>You can find a pretty accurate 3,
but in case let's not use a linear</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10786-1
01:45:43.988 --> 01:45:46.988
<v Hou, Eric>regression.
Let's use this gradient descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10791-0
01:45:46.988 --> 01:45:48.428
<v Hou, Eric>How can we find it OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10796-0
01:45:48.948 --> 01:45:50.508
<v Hou, Eric>Remember, we just want to fix.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10807-0
01:45:50.588 --> 01:45:54.708
<v Hou, Eric>We just want to find a model that fit
this data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10816-0
01:45:55.668 --> 01:46:00.828
<v Hou, Eric>So what we are trying to do is we want to
make sure.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10819-0
01:46:01.338 --> 01:46:02.578
<v Hou, Eric>Our prediction?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10845-0
01:46:04.148 --> 01:46:09.588
<v Hou, Eric>Given X is pretty close,
is very close to the actual YS right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10845-1
01:46:09.588 --> 01:46:15.028
<v Hou, Eric>You give me One X. Are you gonna?
I gonna do some calculation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10875-0
01:46:15.108 --> 01:46:20.180
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna give you 1 error that pretty
close to the Y that you've seen before</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10875-1
01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:25.719
<v Hou, Eric>and then in the in the future you give me
another number I have never seen before.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10875-2
01:46:25.719 --> 01:46:28.388
<v Hou, Eric>I can still give you my prediction of Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10879-0
01:46:29.348 --> 01:46:30.548
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon the historical.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10886-0
01:46:30.938 --> 01:46:33.698
<v Hou, Eric>Accuracy, historical comparison, you know.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10899-0
01:46:35.268 --> 01:46:38.508
<v Hou, Eric>The generated from my model is close to
the actual Y.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10910-0
01:46:38.508 --> 01:46:43.508
<v Hou, Eric>You may be using the the the Y III
generate in the future.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10914-0
01:46:43.908 --> 01:46:45.388
<v Hou, Eric>That's the mindset, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10923-0
01:46:45.588 --> 01:46:51.388
<v Hou, Eric>So convert everything into math is we
know this SSE.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10935-0
01:46:51.388 --> 01:46:56.108
<v Hou, Eric>That's a summation of square error.
We know we have actual YS.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10941-0
01:46:56.828 --> 01:46:59.068
<v Hou, Eric>We know we have our prediction of YS.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10944-0
01:47:00.348 --> 01:47:01.468
<v Hou, Eric>This is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10956-0
01:47:02.308 --> 01:47:07.868
<v Hou, Eric>For all of the dots,
for all of the dots here on this 2D.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10973-0
01:47:08.018 --> 01:47:14.874
<v Hou, Eric>Playing given different acts,
I want to minimize the difference between</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10973-1
01:47:14.874 --> 01:47:18.778
<v Hou, Eric>my actual wise versus my predictive wise.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10981-0
01:47:19.298 --> 01:47:23.698
<v Hou, Eric>And I want every prediction. Great.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10989-0
01:47:23.938 --> 01:47:27.778
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I stumb up all the
differences.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/10991-0
01:47:29.308 --> 01:47:29.508
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11025-0
01:47:30.188 --> 01:47:34.420
<v Hou, Eric>I emphasize it even by squared on.
I sum them together.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11025-1
01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.124
<v Hou, Eric>If I mis predict one of them given a huge
error,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11025-2
01:47:38.124 --> 01:47:43.792
<v Hou, Eric>and they're not going to make this
summation even bigger because I'm going</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11025-3
01:47:43.792 --> 01:47:45.908
<v Hou, Eric>to add that to other errors.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11043-0
01:47:46.628 --> 01:47:52.645
<v Hou, Eric>So the only way to make this summation of
square error small is I have a good</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11043-1
01:47:52.645 --> 01:47:54.188
<v Hou, Eric>prediction for each.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11057-0
01:47:54.988 --> 01:47:58.228
<v Hou, Eric>For each point given different X, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11059-0
01:47:58.708 --> 01:48:00.948
<v Hou, Eric>So that's my that's sort of my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11065-0
01:48:01.138 --> 01:48:03.058
<v Hou, Eric>The goal, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11086-0
01:48:03.498 --> 01:48:08.484
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know I will be estimating
estimating this seven.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11086-1
01:48:08.484 --> 01:48:12.898
<v Hou, Eric>You know it's actually 7,
but I'm going to call it 8.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11106-0
01:48:13.018 --> 01:48:16.324
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm going to call it B and then you'll
be, you know,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11106-1
01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:20.338
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to predicting or guess this
number three given this data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11109-0
01:48:20.338 --> 01:48:21.218
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll call it a.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11120-0
01:48:22.098 --> 01:48:27.738
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just plug in this my prediction
as a multiply XI plus B.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11128-0
01:48:28.708 --> 01:48:30.868
<v Hou, Eric>My my, my original prediction of.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11145-0
01:48:31.258 --> 01:48:38.618
<v Hou, Eric>A and B could be as as bad as I'm
predicting a equal to 0 and B equal to 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11161-0
01:48:38.618 --> 01:48:43.052
<v Hou, Eric>And I was saying, hey,
my prediction is all the numbers here</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11161-1
01:48:43.052 --> 01:48:45.378
<v Hou, Eric>equal to seven across all the X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11171-0
01:48:45.378 --> 01:48:49.115
<v Hou, Eric>That's my prediction.
And you know my errors will be huge</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11171-1
01:48:49.115 --> 01:48:51.498
<v Hou, Eric>because here is going to be my error.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11177-0
01:48:51.498 --> 01:48:52.698
<v Hou, Eric>Here is going to be my error.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11182-0
01:48:52.698 --> 01:48:53.858
<v Hou, Eric>Here is going to be my error.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11187-0
01:48:53.858 --> 01:48:56.458
<v Hou, Eric>So then my error of that original 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11189-0
01:48:57.748 --> 01:48:58.428
<v Hou, Eric>7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11195-0
01:49:00.108 --> 01:49:01.308
<v Hou, Eric>B. Equal to B equal to 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11203-0
01:49:02.818 --> 01:49:06.658
<v Hou, Eric>And an A equal a equal to 0. Sorry.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11212-0
01:49:08.228 --> 01:49:11.668
<v Hou, Eric>A equal to 0 prediction is terrible.
That's a terrible.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11219-0
01:49:13.348 --> 01:49:14.828
<v Hou, Eric>Guess, but let's see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11224-0
01:49:15.508 --> 01:49:17.348
<v Hou, Eric>This is the function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11233-0
01:49:17.348 --> 01:49:22.948
<v Hou, Eric>This is the function I'm going to
minimize, and luckily I see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11245-0
01:49:24.738 --> 01:49:30.018
<v Hou, Eric>I have only one a across all the ends.
All the eyes are equal.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11276-0
01:49:30.018 --> 01:49:34.685
<v Hou, Eric>The one to end.
I have only one a across all the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11276-1
01:49:34.685 --> 01:49:42.304
<v Hou, Eric>summation of those squares I have only 1B
and I can notice that for a this is a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11276-2
01:49:42.304 --> 01:49:44.018
<v Hou, Eric>parabola function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11278-0
01:49:44.458 --> 01:49:46.218
<v Hou, Eric>A parabola curve looks like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11288-0
01:49:47.818 --> 01:49:51.818
<v Hou, Eric>For B is also the parabola curve looks
like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11302-0
01:49:52.498 --> 01:49:57.218
<v Hou, Eric>I believe in your high school or in your
your your college calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11316-0
01:49:57.218 --> 01:50:05.008
<v Hou, Eric>You know how to find Amb to minimize the
square. The summation of a square error,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11316-1
01:50:05.008 --> 01:50:05.578
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11320-0
01:50:06.698 --> 01:50:08.098
<v Hou, Eric>Just quick pause.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11328-0
01:50:08.338 --> 01:50:12.218
<v Hou, Eric>Who knows how to given a parabola,
how to find a minimum number?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11334-0
01:50:19.428 --> 01:50:22.228
<v Hou, Eric>So for example y = X ^2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11338-0
01:50:24.348 --> 01:50:25.308
<v Hou, Eric>Looks like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11347-0
01:50:29.878 --> 01:50:33.998
<v Hou, Eric>How do you find an ax that minimize this
function?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11378-0
01:50:50.978 --> 01:50:53.724
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then what you'll be doing is you're</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11378-1
01:50:53.724 --> 01:50:58.500
<v Hou, Eric>taking derivative and then X square to
the derivative of that is 2X and you set</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11378-2
01:50:58.500 --> 01:50:58.858
<v Hou, Eric>the 0.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11381-0
01:50:58.928 --> 01:51:00.008
<v Hou, Eric>So then actually goes 0.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11386-0
01:51:00.008 --> 01:51:03.328
<v Hou, Eric>So then actually goes zero.
Really minimize this K.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11389-0
01:51:03.648 --> 01:51:05.208
<v Hou, Eric>That's exactly what we're going to do.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11396-0
01:51:07.708 --> 01:51:08.908
<v Hou, Eric>Instead of this, we are.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11399-0
01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:10.268
<v Hou, Eric>We are going to take.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11407-0
01:51:12.738 --> 01:51:14.138
<v Hou, Eric>A partial derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11418-0
01:51:14.298 --> 01:51:18.618
<v Hou, Eric>So partial derivative with respect to A
and partial derivative with respect to B.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11428-0
01:51:19.338 --> 01:51:23.018
<v Hou, Eric>And here's a formula.
You do not have to remember those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11436-0
01:51:23.418 --> 01:51:27.178
<v Hou, Eric>So the gradient descent step is is like
this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11446-0
01:51:27.778 --> 01:51:30.258
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say I'm guessing the intercept.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11448-0
01:51:30.258 --> 01:51:31.938
<v Hou, Eric>I start from some point here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11462-0
01:51:33.968 --> 01:51:39.208
<v Hou, Eric>One I'm to do is OK,
I have my intercept starting point here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11471-0
01:51:39.208 --> 01:51:41.888
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, it's bad, but it's OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11503-0
01:51:42.288 --> 01:51:47.459
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to calculate my derivative,
so derivative is telling me should I move</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11503-1
01:51:47.459 --> 01:51:52.243
<v Hou, Eric>to here or should I move to there and
then hopefully I'm moving the right</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11503-2
01:51:52.243 --> 01:51:57.414
<v Hou, Eric>direction because this is a minimum point
I want the dur to tell me I should be</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11503-3
01:51:57.414 --> 01:51:58.448
<v Hou, Eric>moving this way.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11518-0
01:51:59.258 --> 01:52:03.018
<v Hou, Eric>And then once I move that way by a small
stop, I have a new point.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11530-0
01:52:03.988 --> 01:52:08.588
<v Hou, Eric>I keep moving this way and I have another
stop. I calculate derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11535-0
01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:11.068
<v Hou, Eric>I'm still moving this way and keep moving.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11556-0
01:52:11.968 --> 01:52:17.543
<v Hou, Eric>And hopefully eventually I reach this.
I reach this bottom point that minimize</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11556-1
01:52:17.543 --> 01:52:19.448
<v Hou, Eric>my error and whatever that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11565-0
01:52:20.048 --> 01:52:23.128
<v Hou, Eric>A and B reached the bottom of this
function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11569-0
01:52:23.248 --> 01:52:24.528
<v Hou, Eric>That is my AMB.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11572-0
01:52:24.528 --> 01:52:27.128
<v Hou, Eric>Let's give me the best forecast.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11584-0
01:52:27.918 --> 01:52:31.544
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
And and also here giving this formula we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11584-1
01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.478
<v Hou, Eric>are introducing another.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11591-0
01:52:35.018 --> 01:52:37.818
<v Hou, Eric>Concept is called learning rate is LR.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11593-0
01:52:46.898 --> 01:52:47.778
<v Hou, Eric>Learning rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11597-0
01:52:49.338 --> 01:52:50.258
<v Hou, Eric>So what is the learning rate?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11604-0
01:52:50.258 --> 01:52:54.378
<v Hou, Eric>The learning rate is controlling whether
I am moving.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11613-0
01:52:58.528 --> 01:53:03.728
<v Hou, Eric>Moving this small steps or this gigantic
steps.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11620-0
01:53:04.728 --> 01:53:07.568
<v Hou, Eric>So what's the what's the issue with this
big steps?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11622-0
01:53:08.528 --> 01:53:09.048
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11636-0
01:53:10.618 --> 01:53:14.578
<v Hou, Eric>If I first step, I go there,
second step I go here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11642-0
01:53:15.178 --> 01:53:17.858
<v Hou, Eric>The stir stab I may not even reach the
bottom.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11645-0
01:53:17.858 --> 01:53:18.938
<v Hou, Eric>I may just go here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11657-0
01:53:21.238 --> 01:53:24.318
<v Hou, Eric>So that's what happened.
And then we want to avoid that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11663-0
01:53:25.518 --> 01:53:28.278
<v Hou, Eric>But what's the issue with a super tiny
steps?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11672-0
01:53:28.358 --> 01:53:31.838
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna go here and keep going.
Keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11692-0
01:53:31.918 --> 01:53:37.625
<v Hou, Eric>You'll find that you use a super tiny
stops the the learning curve,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11692-1
01:53:37.625 --> 01:53:40.478
<v Hou, Eric>the learning gonna be really slow.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11708-0
01:53:40.958 --> 01:53:45.339
<v Hou, Eric>And after maybe so many stop,
you will eventually reach here and then</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11708-1
01:53:45.339 --> 01:53:48.718
<v Hou, Eric>not gonna be really computationally
expensive, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11713-0
01:53:49.498 --> 01:53:50.898
<v Hou, Eric>So now let me show you one example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11723-0
01:53:51.528 --> 01:53:55.768
<v Hou, Eric>No,
basically estimate is Y equal to 7 + 3 X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11729-0
01:54:21.858 --> 01:54:22.018
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11733-0
01:54:22.018 --> 01:54:24.018
<v Hou, Eric>I'm loading my whole space.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11737-0
01:54:25.778 --> 01:54:26.978
<v Hou, Eric>Gradient descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11764-0
01:54:29.658 --> 01:54:36.487
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm I'm generating data and the data
is really like y + 3 X +7 and let's say</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11764-1
01:54:36.487 --> 01:54:40.498
<v Hou, Eric>we I'm saying that I have learning rate
of .1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11772-0
01:54:42.378 --> 01:54:44.178
<v Hou, Eric>Iteration 100 times.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11785-0
01:54:45.058 --> 01:54:49.218
<v Hou, Eric>Every time I'm just basically calculating
the derivatives and then keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11788-0
01:54:49.218 --> 01:54:50.778
<v Hou, Eric>So then I mean, let me just run it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11824-0
01:55:05.508 --> 01:55:12.081
<v Hou, Eric>So then eventually I have my estimate of
the intercept equal to 7.1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11824-1
01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:18.748
<v Hou, Eric>My estimate of the the scope is a 2.86.
So as you can see this is my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11834-0
01:55:19.428 --> 01:55:22.868
<v Hou, Eric>The Theta one is my slope and this one is
my intercept estimate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11849-0
01:55:22.868 --> 01:55:25.530
<v Hou, Eric>And then as you can see,
they are getting like more and more</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11849-1
01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:26.228
<v Hou, Eric>flattened curve.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11856-0
01:55:26.428 --> 01:55:29.908
<v Hou, Eric>So this approaching converging to some
number, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11868-0
01:55:29.908 --> 01:55:33.253
<v Hou, Eric>You know from your mind, you know,
this number should be 7 and this number</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11868-1
01:55:33.253 --> 01:55:33.788
<v Hou, Eric>should be 3.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11870-0
01:55:33.788 --> 01:55:34.588
<v Hou, Eric>But we are getting close.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11882-0
01:55:36.138 --> 01:55:39.898
<v Hou, Eric>And this curve is showing you from
iteration 0.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11885-0
01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:40.498
<v Hou, Eric>I have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11888-0
01:55:40.498 --> 01:55:41.338
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the points.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11892-0
01:55:41.378 --> 01:55:43.218
<v Hou, Eric>I have a totally wrong prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11893-0
01:55:43.898 --> 01:55:44.938
<v Hou, Eric>It's terrible.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11907-0
01:55:45.378 --> 01:55:50.650
<v Hou, Eric>And then guiding to iteration 25,
I can get in really, really good,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11907-1
01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:51.658
<v Hou, Eric>but since my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11911-0
01:55:53.378 --> 01:55:53.738
<v Hou, Eric>Keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11936-0
01:55:53.738 --> 01:55:59.182
<v Hou, Eric>And then my my my SSR my my squared
summation of square errors getting</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11936-1
01:55:59.182 --> 01:56:03.858
<v Hou, Eric>smaller smaller eventually this is my
final regression line.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11946-0
01:56:04.568 --> 01:56:07.568
<v Hou, Eric>That one is among those regression lines.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11948-0
01:56:07.768 --> 01:56:09.248
<v Hou, Eric>That one is really the best.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11960-0
01:56:10.818 --> 01:56:14.409
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
We actually go from this this line to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11960-1
01:56:14.409 --> 01:56:15.178
<v Hou, Eric>this one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11961-0
01:56:15.178 --> 01:56:16.458
<v Hou, Eric>This is really great.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11986-0
01:56:16.458 --> 01:56:23.563
<v Hou, Eric>And then and we know the final regression
line, the Theta is 7.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11986-1
01:56:23.563 --> 01:56:27.338
<v Hou, Eric>10 and then slope is 2 point 8486.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/11990-0
01:56:27.338 --> 01:56:29.058
<v Hou, Eric>This this very good right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12004-0
01:56:29.458 --> 01:56:35.058
<v Hou, Eric>So what we can do is let's just let's
just add this iteration to 150.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12018-0
01:56:36.928 --> 01:56:43.168
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you can see that, OK,
so there's getting not so great, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12029-0
01:56:43.168 --> 01:56:47.380
<v Hou, Eric>So there is this.
I think we just missed the final the, the,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12029-1
01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.968
<v Hou, Eric>the, the minimum point.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12040-0
01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:54.088
<v Hou, Eric>So then what we can do is we can change
this learn rate to .05.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12055-0
01:56:55.658 --> 01:56:59.544
<v Hou, Eric>So then we are just short in that
learning curve and let's see this for</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12055-1
01:56:59.544 --> 01:57:00.138
<v Hou, Eric>comparison.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12062-0
01:57:00.138 --> 01:57:03.218
<v Hou, Eric>Let's still see what the iteration equal
to 100.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12064-0
01:57:03.218 --> 01:57:04.378
<v Hou, Eric>How does that look like?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12069-0
01:57:06.618 --> 01:57:08.098
<v Hou, Eric>Well, it's definitely not great.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12080-0
01:57:09.658 --> 01:57:13.218
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, this is not so great.
I think you just got it diverged right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12093-0
01:57:13.218 --> 01:57:16.984
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's say, oh, sorry .5,
it should be .05. Sorry,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12093-1
01:57:16.984 --> 01:57:18.218
<v Hou, Eric>apologize for that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12107-0
01:57:21.488 --> 01:57:26.323
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see,
it's only A-100 iterations with learning</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12107-1
01:57:26.323 --> 01:57:27.048
<v Hou, Eric>rate .05.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12120-0
01:57:29.818 --> 01:57:32.538
<v Hou, Eric>The the interseb is 6.6.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12131-0
01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:37.218
<v Hou, Eric>You know, the original intersection is 7.
1 with alert rate .1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12145-0
01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:41.225
<v Hou, Eric>So then I would say this is definitely
worse prediction with this smaller</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12145-1
01:57:41.225 --> 01:57:41.938
<v Hou, Eric>learning rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12157-0
01:57:41.938 --> 01:57:45.817
<v Hou, Eric>So then with smaller learning rate,
you need to increase the number of</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12157-1
01:57:45.817 --> 01:57:46.418
<v Hou, Eric>iterations.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12162-0
01:57:46.418 --> 01:57:48.378
<v Hou, Eric>Let's call it 200.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12180-0
01:57:53.108 --> 01:57:57.428
<v Hou, Eric>Right. As you can see,
we are getting close to that .</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12180-1
01:57:57.428 --> 01:57:59.828
<v Hou, Eric>1 level with 200 leaderations.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12187-0
01:58:00.228 --> 01:58:03.228
<v Hou, Eric>Let me change 200 iteration to 500.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12200-0
01:58:07.868 --> 01:58:13.788
<v Hou, Eric>It's not getting so much better,
but it's still it's getting flattened.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12206-0
01:58:13.828 --> 01:58:16.828
<v Hou, Eric>I think there's no difference between
those numbers here, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12216-0
01:58:17.148 --> 01:58:21.148
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually change this
learning rate even smaller, smaller.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12226-0
01:58:23.048 --> 01:58:25.088
<v Hou, Eric>And and you can definitely learn more.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12228-0
01:58:25.208 --> 01:58:26.528
<v Hou, Eric>The model can definitely learn more.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12232-0
01:58:33.608 --> 01:58:35.128
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So you have those numbers?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12242-0
01:58:47.018 --> 01:58:51.458
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have this and then those
those curves that I'm showing you right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12244-0
01:58:53.018 --> 01:58:53.138
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12247-0
01:58:54.778 --> 01:58:55.098
<v Hou, Eric>Show you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12257-0
01:59:11.948 --> 01:59:15.828
<v Hou, Eric>So what gradient descent is really
telling us is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12262-0
01:59:17.538 --> 01:59:19.978
<v Hou, Eric>So it just convert.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12288-0
01:59:22.998 --> 01:59:29.957
<v Hou, Eric>The gradient descent is really convert an
optimization problem like I was just want</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12288-1
01:59:29.957 --> 01:59:34.679
<v Hou, Eric>to optimize this with respect to A and B
into a problem.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12288-2
01:59:34.679 --> 01:59:36.998
<v Hou, Eric>I can try a list of numbers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12319-0
01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:44.526
<v Hou, Eric>And by, you know, the first guess,
the second guess the the third guess and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12319-1
01:59:44.526 --> 01:59:51.065
<v Hou, Eric>you can keep guessing and using this way
the my my guess the my guess of the those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12319-2
01:59:51.065 --> 01:59:54.138
<v Hou, Eric>AMB parameters of this linear function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12329-0
01:59:54.488 --> 01:59:57.208
<v Hou, Eric>Is it getting closer and closer to the
real values?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12352-0
01:59:58.778 --> 02:00:04.447
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really powerful concept that
you're gonna keep using it to guiding</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12352-1
02:00:04.447 --> 02:00:07.778
<v Hou, Eric>your model closer and closer to the real
life.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12379-0
02:00:07.778 --> 02:00:13.777
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's why this gradient
descent is so important and is so well</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12379-1
02:00:13.777 --> 02:00:19.938
<v Hou, Eric>known and then widely used in a number of
machine learning and AI projects.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12386-0
02:00:20.818 --> 02:00:24.618
<v Hou, Eric>You you check neural network check LLM
you eventually find.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12391-0
02:00:25.208 --> 02:00:27.368
<v Hou, Eric>There's going to be a gradient descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12395-0
02:00:28.938 --> 02:00:30.138
<v Hou, Eric>If you do read.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12403-0
02:00:31.858 --> 02:00:34.578
<v Hou, Eric>The the the the structure of transformer.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12414-0
02:00:36.298 --> 02:00:39.778
<v Hou, Eric>Behind large language model you can
definitely see a gradient descent.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12420-0
02:00:41.038 --> 02:00:42.318
<v Hou, Eric>Concept there, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12423-0
02:00:42.318 --> 02:00:43.878
<v Hou, Eric>So now we're gonna cover that later.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12437-0
02:00:44.438 --> 02:00:48.678
<v Hou, Eric>So then how are we going to use gradient
descent here in the tree model?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12440-0
02:00:48.878 --> 02:00:50.718
<v Hou, Eric>So there's one model support.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12448-0
02:00:52.258 --> 02:00:53.898
<v Hou, Eric>Gradient boosting OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12486-0
02:00:53.898 --> 02:00:59.362
<v Hou, Eric>So this is another really powerful model
and then it's getting more and more</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12486-1
02:00:59.362 --> 02:01:04.045
<v Hou, Eric>complex as you can see,
you definitely gonna use some mathematics</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12486-2
02:01:04.045 --> 02:01:09.083
<v Hou, Eric>here and then we and for this example,
I definitely prepare, you know,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12486-3
02:01:09.083 --> 02:01:10.218
<v Hou, Eric>the Step 1 by 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12491-0
02:01:10.288 --> 02:01:11.968
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just go there, OK?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12493-0
02:01:12.168 --> 02:01:14.328
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's called gradient boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12501-0
02:01:15.858 --> 02:01:17.458
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely improve the
classification.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12507-0
02:01:17.498 --> 02:01:19.898
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely improve the improve
the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12514-0
02:01:21.658 --> 02:01:23.218
<v Hou, Eric>Improve the regression.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12541-0
02:01:23.498 --> 02:01:27.852
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a powerful models and then and
after gradient boosting, we're gonna use.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12541-1
02:01:27.852 --> 02:01:31.947
<v Hou, Eric>You can even talk about extreme gradient
boosting that's called Asterix boost,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12541-2
02:01:31.947 --> 02:01:32.258
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12547-0
02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:36.698
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's say let's start with some
training data, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12554-0
02:01:36.938 --> 02:01:40.418
<v Hou, Eric>So now we're gonna talk about a lot of
core of mathematics.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12565-0
02:01:40.808 --> 02:01:45.088
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then it's complex, but it's OK.
Let's go step by step, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12583-0
02:01:45.528 --> 02:01:50.104
<v Hou, Eric>So now we the only issue.
The only difficulties I learned from</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12583-1
02:01:50.104 --> 02:01:53.808
<v Hou, Eric>learn read this are gradient boosting
paper right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12590-0
02:01:53.808 --> 02:01:56.168
<v Hou, Eric>So it's it's really the index system.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12595-0
02:01:56.168 --> 02:01:57.488
<v Hou, Eric>It's really confusing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12603-0
02:01:57.728 --> 02:02:00.248
<v Hou, Eric>So then just before we we we enter that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12617-0
02:02:00.248 --> 02:02:04.311
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's just make sure that we we
we understand those index.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12617-1
02:02:04.311 --> 02:02:05.888
<v Hou, Eric>I have a data set in this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12621-0
02:02:06.658 --> 02:02:07.178
<v Hou, Eric>This is my train data set.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12630-0
02:02:08.218 --> 02:02:09.898
<v Hou, Eric>So I = 1 to little N.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12634-0
02:02:09.978 --> 02:02:11.338
<v Hou, Eric>So what does that tell me?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12666-0
02:02:11.658 --> 02:02:19.069
<v Hou, Eric>Imagine that I I have 10 rows of data
where the Y is my house price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12666-1
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:27.769
<v Hou, Eric>My X is my house size and I have 10 rows
of them so that is I equal to one and N</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12666-2
02:02:27.769 --> 02:02:29.058
<v Hou, Eric>equal to 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12676-0
02:02:29.058 --> 02:02:32.738
<v Hou, Eric>So I have 10 rows of them.
The 1st row is telling me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12688-0
02:02:33.538 --> 02:02:38.578
<v Hou, Eric>How size 1000 square feet my house price
of $200,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12697-0
02:02:39.358 --> 02:02:42.558
<v Hou, Eric>That is my first pair of information,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12706-0
02:02:42.838 --> 02:02:48.558
<v Hou, Eric>But XI can be only one number and XI can
be 3 numbers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12710-0
02:02:48.798 --> 02:02:50.718
<v Hou, Eric>The XI could be OK I have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12728-0
02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:59.778
<v Hou, Eric>The house size I have, number of bedrooms,
I have year built right? So then the XI.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12748-0
02:03:01.538 --> 02:03:06.436
<v Hou, Eric>Is representing a vector of information,
not necessarily only one number,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12748-1
02:03:06.436 --> 02:03:08.818
<v Hou, Eric>but YIS are usually just one number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12754-0
02:03:09.368 --> 02:03:10.808
<v Hou, Eric>Either zero or one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12767-0
02:03:10.808 --> 02:03:17.142
<v Hou, Eric>We're talking about classification or
just a continuous 1 using like house</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12767-1
02:03:17.142 --> 02:03:17.648
<v Hou, Eric>price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12774-0
02:03:18.048 --> 02:03:22.728
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is this little end is I are
index.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12781-0
02:03:24.298 --> 02:03:25.498
<v Hou, Eric>For the sample size, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12788-0
02:03:28.458 --> 02:03:29.698
<v Hou, Eric>A differentiable loss function. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12795-0
02:03:29.698 --> 02:03:33.018
<v Hou, Eric>We can ignore that differentiable loss
function this one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12798-0
02:03:33.378 --> 02:03:34.738
<v Hou, Eric>What is this function?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12806-0
02:03:34.738 --> 02:03:39.258
<v Hou, Eric>This function is used to compare my
prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12810-0
02:03:40.898 --> 02:03:41.778
<v Hou, Eric>And my actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12812-0
02:03:42.128 --> 02:03:42.328
<v Hou, Eric>It's.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12816-0
02:03:44.098 --> 02:03:45.938
<v Hou, Eric>This loss function is telling me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12835-0
02:03:47.498 --> 02:03:53.347
<v Hou, Eric>In a quantifiable way,
how good or bad my prediction is if the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12835-1
02:03:53.347 --> 02:03:57.618
<v Hou, Eric>actual value is $200,
000 and I'm giving you?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12846-0
02:03:59.658 --> 02:04:03.818
<v Hou, Eric>200 a $199,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12849-0
02:04:03.818 --> 02:04:05.298
<v Hou, Eric>I'm only missing 1000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12866-0
02:04:05.298 --> 02:04:10.852
<v Hou, Eric>That means like this loss function should
give me a number that's a pretty close to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12866-1
02:04:10.852 --> 02:04:13.298
<v Hou, Eric>and that's 1000 or some small number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12888-0
02:04:13.808 --> 02:04:17.195
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
And and compared to a really poor</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12888-1
02:04:17.195 --> 02:04:21.408
<v Hou, Eric>prediction saying 100,
000 that I miss half of it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12900-0
02:04:21.688 --> 02:04:27.900
<v Hou, Eric>So then this loss function gonna give me
one number to tell me my prediction is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12900-1
02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:28.288
<v Hou, Eric>good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12913-0
02:04:28.288 --> 02:04:33.069
<v Hou, Eric>Usually that's a small number and another
number to tell me my prediction is so</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12913-1
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.368
<v Hou, Eric>poor.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12924-0
02:04:33.368 --> 02:04:37.648
<v Hou, Eric>And usually that's a big number.
So that is this loss function is working.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12926-0
02:04:37.648 --> 02:04:38.448
<v Hou, Eric>Just tell me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12936-0
02:04:39.258 --> 02:04:43.978
<v Hou, Eric>How good or bad my prediction is in a
quantifiable way?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12939-0
02:04:45.138 --> 02:04:45.658
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12947-0
02:04:46.098 --> 02:04:48.545
<v Hou, Eric>Well,
no matter what loss function you're using</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12947-1
02:04:48.545 --> 02:04:48.698
<v Hou, Eric>it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12953-0
02:04:48.698 --> 02:04:52.018
<v Hou, Eric>Just tell me good or bad.
The quality of my prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12968-0
02:04:53.578 --> 02:04:57.320
<v Hou, Eric>Number of iterations,
meaning how many iterations I'm going to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12968-1
02:04:57.320 --> 02:04:57.498
<v Hou, Eric>do.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12971-0
02:04:57.858 --> 02:04:58.418
<v Hou, Eric>I call it M.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12975-0
02:04:58.778 --> 02:04:59.778
<v Hou, Eric>The M could be one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12994-0
02:04:59.778 --> 02:05:02.880
<v Hou, Eric>I just use one tree for all the tree
models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12994-1
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:07.016
<v Hou, Eric>The basic tree model we talk about,
you have only one tree,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/12994-2
02:05:07.016 --> 02:05:09.498
<v Hou, Eric>the number of iterations equal to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13009-0
02:05:11.218 --> 02:05:14.714
<v Hou, Eric>For random forest you do not have any
iteration because you're building</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13009-1
02:05:14.714 --> 02:05:16.898
<v Hou, Eric>different trees on based upon the same
data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13022-0
02:05:17.808 --> 02:05:22.924
<v Hou, Eric>Through random selection you do not have
any iteration that iteration equal to 0</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13022-1
02:05:22.924 --> 02:05:23.808
<v Hou, Eric>for add boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13031-0
02:05:25.378 --> 02:05:27.538
<v Hou, Eric>Say in that in that example I show you 5.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13041-0
02:05:29.138 --> 02:05:32.538
<v Hou, Eric>Simple 5 stomps so then my iteration
equal to 5.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13050-0
02:05:32.538 --> 02:05:35.458
<v Hou, Eric>So then the capital M equal to five. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13054-0
02:05:35.898 --> 02:05:37.458
<v Hou, Eric>So that is the setup.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13060-0
02:05:37.458 --> 02:05:39.218
<v Hou, Eric>That's the input data that we have.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13069-0
02:05:39.658 --> 02:05:43.738
<v Hou, Eric>We have a bunch of data we can train the
model based upon.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13077-0
02:05:44.338 --> 02:05:49.218
<v Hou, Eric>We define a metric that tell me how good
a bad my predictions are.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13091-0
02:05:50.148 --> 02:05:54.338
<v Hou, Eric>And I have another number,
meaning I how many iterations are gonna</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13091-1
02:05:54.338 --> 02:05:54.588
<v Hou, Eric>run.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13097-0
02:05:55.188 --> 02:05:57.348
<v Hou, Eric>Good. Good enough to start this journey.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13098-0
02:05:57.788 --> 02:05:58.268
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13099-0
02:05:58.468 --> 02:06:00.228
<v Hou, Eric>Any question so far?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13102-0
02:06:05.758 --> 02:06:06.198
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13138-0
02:06:06.838 --> 02:06:14.079
<v Hou, Eric>So first up, we will give a random guess.
Well for this the gradient boost,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13138-1
02:06:14.079 --> 02:06:20.177
<v Hou, Eric>the guess is not so random, but if I were,
if I I ask you guys,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13138-2
02:06:20.177 --> 02:06:25.798
<v Hou, Eric>you have 10 rows of a house price data.
What's your guess?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13153-0
02:06:28.988 --> 02:06:33.148
<v Hou, Eric>If you you you don't any tree models,
what's your guess of the house price?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13166-0
02:06:33.828 --> 02:06:37.003
<v Hou, Eric>Just give me one number if you I ask you
to give me one number. What?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13166-1
02:06:37.003 --> 02:06:38.228
<v Hou, Eric>How you choose that number?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13169-0
02:06:44.788 --> 02:06:47.028
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Like just guess, like a number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13176-0
02:06:46.418 --> 02:06:47.938
<v Hou, Eric>Cheers, Gaz. Yep.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13178-0
02:06:47.568 --> 02:06:49.608
<v Benbenek, Matthew>OK, 300,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13195-0
02:06:52.308 --> 02:06:55.210
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly, that'll work for me.
And then you. I'll,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13195-1
02:06:55.210 --> 02:06:57.428
<v Hou, Eric>I'll tell you know why that would work?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13206-0
02:06:57.708 --> 02:07:02.748
<v Hou, Eric>But if you know the term rules of of of,
of, of numbers, right, so then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13214-0
02:07:04.288 --> 02:07:07.848
<v Hou, Eric>And that that actually work honestly.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13217-0
02:07:07.968 --> 02:07:09.128
<v Hou, Eric>But they say OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13223-0
02:07:09.128 --> 02:07:10.408
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just give the number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13228-0
02:07:10.408 --> 02:07:12.768
<v Hou, Eric>Based on this,
you can ignore this math formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13248-0
02:07:13.208 --> 02:07:16.891
<v Hou, Eric>I I can tell you,
but if you know 10 price is you can give</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13248-1
02:07:16.891 --> 02:07:20.448
<v Hou, Eric>a random number and and what other
numbers you can give.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13251-0
02:07:23.578 --> 02:07:24.098
<v Benbenek, Matthew>The average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13255-0
02:07:24.978 --> 02:07:27.458
<v Hou, Eric>Exactly, that's an answer I'm waiting for.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13262-0
02:07:29.018 --> 02:07:32.458
<v Hou, Eric>What does this formula tell us honestly?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13271-0
02:07:34.138 --> 02:07:37.178
<v Hou, Eric>This is a really a fancy way to say
average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13286-0
02:07:42.428 --> 02:07:49.339
<v Hou, Eric>There is nothing more, nothing less.
This app 0X equal to argument summation</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13286-1
02:07:49.339 --> 02:07:49.788
<v Hou, Eric>sign.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13290-0
02:07:52.568 --> 02:07:54.408
<v Hou, Eric>This is telling me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13300-0
02:07:55.978 --> 02:08:00.418
<v Hou, Eric>The constant value equal to average of
all your observations.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13305-0
02:08:02.648 --> 02:08:03.528
<v Hou, Eric>Just ignore.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13311-0
02:08:03.528 --> 02:08:06.048
<v Hou, Eric>Just forget about it is a fancy formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13315-0
02:08:06.048 --> 02:08:06.928
<v Hou, Eric>Just make sure.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13318-0
02:08:06.928 --> 02:08:08.568
<v Hou, Eric>Make it really fancy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13320-0
02:08:08.808 --> 02:08:09.848
<v Hou, Eric>Is it just an average?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13343-0
02:08:11.418 --> 02:08:14.368
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know why they have to put in this
way,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13343-1
02:08:14.368 --> 02:08:18.698
<v Hou, Eric>but keep in mind your first guess is all
is your average. That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13344-0
02:08:19.138 --> 02:08:19.978
<v Hou, Eric>That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13346-0
02:08:20.818 --> 02:08:22.218
<v Hou, Eric>OK, let me show you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13367-0
02:08:23.978 --> 02:08:27.491
<v Hou, Eric>This is this is the first stop you gonna
come up with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13367-1
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:31.898
<v Hou, Eric>Some random number that is a constant.
And I totally agree with you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13377-0
02:08:33.318 --> 02:08:36.438
<v Hou, Eric>Matt, you can give a $300,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13381-0
02:08:36.838 --> 02:08:37.678
<v Hou, Eric>That's totally fine.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13382-0
02:08:38.358 --> 02:08:39.158
<v Hou, Eric>That's fine with me.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13396-0
02:08:40.698 --> 02:08:44.738
<v Hou, Eric>But since they define this one,
this is actually a random number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13411-0
02:08:44.938 --> 02:08:48.083
<v Hou, Eric>This is actually an average and then here
is a.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13411-1
02:08:48.083 --> 02:08:51.818
<v Hou, Eric>Here is usually how we define our our our
loss function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13415-0
02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:54.458
<v Hou, Eric>Your actual your prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13420-0
02:08:54.698 --> 02:08:57.578
<v Hou, Eric>You'll find the difference between them.
You square them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13430-0
02:08:59.258 --> 02:09:01.818
<v Hou, Eric>You sum it, you sum those squares up.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13444-0
02:09:02.648 --> 02:09:06.088
<v Hou, Eric>And and multip by 1/2 and I always think
why we multiply by 1/2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13451-0
02:09:06.728 --> 02:09:09.488
<v Hou, Eric>Let let's say let's see,
we have only two numbers.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13457-0
02:09:09.488 --> 02:09:11.448
<v Hou, Eric>Why? Why one and why 2 right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13470-0
02:09:11.448 --> 02:09:16.827
<v Hou, Eric>So then we gonna find a gamma,
a Greek letter gamma to minimize this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13470-1
02:09:16.827 --> 02:09:17.528
<v Hou, Eric>function.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13481-0
02:09:17.528 --> 02:09:21.888
<v Hou, Eric>What we do, we we take, we take,
we take derivatives, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13493-0
02:09:21.888 --> 02:09:25.869
<v Hou, Eric>So then we saw we said the derivative
equal to 0 and solve for gamma and turns</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13493-1
02:09:25.869 --> 02:09:27.128
<v Hou, Eric>out gamma equals average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13499-0
02:09:28.618 --> 02:09:31.298
<v Hou, Eric>And to generalize it, your first guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13509-0
02:09:32.608 --> 02:09:35.768
<v Hou, Eric>Is the average,
so this is something I mentioned.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13537-0
02:09:35.848 --> 02:09:41.169
<v Hou, Eric>I put some words in in blue and this is
the first ever time you you see you you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13537-1
02:09:41.169 --> 02:09:46.157
<v Hou, Eric>start seeing those those blue words.
The first guess is the average of the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13537-2
02:09:46.157 --> 02:09:47.088
<v Hou, Eric>training data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13546-0
02:09:47.888 --> 02:09:51.372
<v Hou, Eric>Nothing more.
You don't have to remember this fancy</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13546-1
02:09:51.372 --> 02:09:53.448
<v Hou, Eric>formula. I proved that average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13553-0
02:09:55.018 --> 02:09:56.618
<v Hou, Eric>When you have the average right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13561-0
02:09:56.618 --> 02:10:00.258
<v Hou, Eric>So then you gonna start that iteration.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13572-0
02:10:00.498 --> 02:10:04.536
<v Hou, Eric>So now you just say, hey,
I have I this one give you another fancy</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13572-1
02:10:04.536 --> 02:10:05.018
<v Hou, Eric>formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13584-0
02:10:05.528 --> 02:10:08.502
<v Hou, Eric>Hey,
a computer so-called a pseudo residuals</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13584-1
02:10:08.502 --> 02:10:10.088
<v Hou, Eric>blah blah like this. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13587-0
02:10:10.208 --> 02:10:12.128
<v Hou, Eric>So the take away is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13596-0
02:10:13.698 --> 02:10:17.858
<v Hou, Eric>This very formula showing here super
fancy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13611-0
02:10:19.698 --> 02:10:24.578
<v Hou, Eric>Some really fancy partial derivatives.
What I'm telling you is you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13617-0
02:10:24.698 --> 02:10:26.618
<v Hou, Eric>If you want, you can read this proof.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13629-0
02:10:27.658 --> 02:10:35.367
<v Hou, Eric>But what I'm telling you is this proof is
telling you that you have your initial</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13629-1
02:10:35.367 --> 02:10:35.938
<v Hou, Eric>guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13654-0
02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:39.501
<v Hou, Eric>Which is your average of the training
data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13654-1
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:45.125
<v Hou, Eric>This tab is for every training data you
just calculate the difference between</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13654-2
02:10:45.125 --> 02:10:47.288
<v Hou, Eric>that data versus your average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13666-0
02:10:49.178 --> 02:10:51.338
<v Hou, Eric>Right. And then later on you can.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13686-0
02:10:51.498 --> 02:10:57.838
<v Hou, Eric>For each iteration you can come up with
one guess of 1 prediction,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13686-1
02:10:57.838 --> 02:11:04.556
<v Hou, Eric>and for those iterations you just
basically calculate the actual value</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13686-2
02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:05.218
<v Hou, Eric>versus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13724-0
02:11:06.338 --> 02:11:13.454
<v Hou, Eric>The difference between your actual value
and your guess in that round M. OK,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13724-1
02:11:13.454 --> 02:11:20.477
<v Hou, Eric>so for m = 1 because your initial guess
is the average, you calculate $200,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13724-2
02:11:20.477 --> 02:11:25.467
<v Hou, Eric>000 minus the average of that ten data
you collected,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13724-3
02:11:25.467 --> 02:11:28.978
<v Hou, Eric>and and then you move to row two, the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13732-0
02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:33.167
<v Hou, Eric>$180,
000 minus the average of the 1010 samples</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13732-1
02:11:33.167 --> 02:11:34.368
<v Hou, Eric>you collected.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13734-0
02:11:34.848 --> 02:11:35.448
<v Hou, Eric>That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13752-0
02:11:37.018 --> 02:11:40.366
<v Hou, Eric>You'll calculate differences so the take
away is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13752-1
02:11:40.366 --> 02:11:42.978
<v Hou, Eric>We will continue calculating residuals.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13757-0
02:11:42.978 --> 02:11:45.538
<v Hou, Eric>Residual is statistical term.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13779-0
02:11:45.538 --> 02:11:48.946
<v Hou, Eric>It's basically saying that we continue
calculating differences,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13779-1
02:11:48.946 --> 02:11:53.258
<v Hou, Eric>which are the differences between the
actual value and the previous predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13790-0
02:11:54.938 --> 02:12:00.578
<v Hou, Eric>Where in round one your previous
prediction is just the averages.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13810-0
02:12:02.248 --> 02:12:06.794
<v Hou, Eric>Is just the average of their trading data,
and later on they may not be equal to the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13810-1
02:12:06.794 --> 02:12:10.164
<v Hou, Eric>average of the training data,
but but every single step you're</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13810-2
02:12:10.164 --> 02:12:11.608
<v Hou, Eric>calculating the difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13812-0
02:12:13.178 --> 02:12:13.338
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13818-0
02:12:16.208 --> 02:12:19.368
<v Hou, Eric>3rd step, third step is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13824-0
02:12:20.938 --> 02:12:23.418
<v Hou, Eric>Feet a base learner, a weak learner.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13846-0
02:12:25.138 --> 02:12:31.239
<v Hou, Eric>Close under scanning. Hmm,
acts 2 pseudo residuals IE training using</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13846-1
02:12:31.239 --> 02:12:33.538
<v Hou, Eric>training set blah blah OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13847-0
02:12:33.538 --> 02:12:34.658
<v Hou, Eric>What does that mean?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13858-0
02:12:38.418 --> 02:12:42.978
<v Hou, Eric>This HMX is a fancy way to call a
decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13861-0
02:12:44.618 --> 02:12:45.178
<v Hou, Eric>It is nothing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13872-0
02:12:46.858 --> 02:12:50.498
<v Hou, Eric>It just made the other one to generalize
this idea.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13876-0
02:12:50.858 --> 02:12:53.178
<v Hou, Eric>So this one is a tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13888-0
02:12:55.288 --> 02:13:00.808
<v Hou, Eric>And what we're going to do is we will be
building a tree like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13890-0
02:13:02.408 --> 02:13:03.208
<v Hou, Eric>Your data.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13905-0
02:13:04.778 --> 02:13:08.914
<v Hou, Eric>Your training data that acts will be
check whether or not it made the first</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13905-1
02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:09.458
<v Hou, Eric>condition.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13913-0
02:13:09.978 --> 02:13:12.864
<v Hou, Eric>If you meet,
you gonna check the second condition.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13913-1
02:13:12.864 --> 02:13:14.618
<v Hou, Eric>If you meet, you gonna go here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13930-0
02:13:16.338 --> 02:13:20.418
<v Hou, Eric>If your X data doesn't meet the first
check first condition you gonna be here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13931-0
02:13:20.538 --> 02:13:22.018
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm telling you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13936-0
02:13:23.698 --> 02:13:25.818
<v Hou, Eric>Using this tree as example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13948-0
02:13:27.418 --> 02:13:32.778
<v Hou, Eric>Your 10 rows of X will eventually either
in their phone in this box.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13952-0
02:13:34.088 --> 02:13:35.568
<v Hou, Eric>Or fall in this box.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13954-0
02:13:35.848 --> 02:13:36.888
<v Hou, Eric>Or fall in this box.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13970-0
02:13:38.938 --> 02:13:43.579
<v Hou, Eric>Because the axe gonna tell you whether
first condition or second condition a yes,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13970-1
02:13:43.579 --> 02:13:44.258
<v Hou, Eric>no question.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/13972-0
02:13:44.258 --> 02:13:46.058
<v Hou, Eric>You only have 3 outcomes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14003-0
02:13:47.738 --> 02:13:55.295
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then if based upon your X,
you fall into this outcome, this this,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14003-1
02:13:55.295 --> 02:14:01.858
<v Hou, Eric>this fancy B3 comma M gonna be your
prediction based upon that X?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14009-0
02:14:02.218 --> 02:14:04.938
<v Hou, Eric>So this tree is basically telling you OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14036-0
02:14:05.408 --> 02:14:10.376
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon this tree,
you will eventually have 3 predictions</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14036-1
02:14:10.376 --> 02:14:16.728
<v Hou, Eric>and the three predictions gonna assign to
all your 10 axes that you have. OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14052-0
02:14:16.928 --> 02:14:23.241
<v Hou, Eric>So basically this step is telling you
that I need a tree and I need to generate</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14052-1
02:14:23.241 --> 02:14:25.608
<v Hou, Eric>predictions based upon your X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14055-0
02:14:28.158 --> 02:14:29.398
<v Hou, Eric>OK for example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14065-0
02:14:33.138 --> 02:14:37.058
<v Hou, Eric>Leap one I bought for, for, for.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14072-0
02:14:37.058 --> 02:14:40.658
<v Hou, Eric>The values in here are you going to be
your residuals.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14077-0
02:14:40.698 --> 02:14:41.978
<v Hou, Eric>Right the your residuals.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14098-0
02:14:42.098 --> 02:14:48.610
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say we have 4 numbers and then
the four conditions and then 200 of -400</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14098-1
02:14:48.610 --> 02:14:50.298
<v Hou, Eric>are going to be here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14108-0
02:14:50.498 --> 02:14:55.498
<v Hou, Eric>So then my prediction of my residuals
will be just the average of those two.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14112-0
02:14:56.458 --> 02:14:57.658
<v Hou, Eric>And then so then my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14141-0
02:14:58.048 --> 02:15:06.860
<v Hou, Eric>B1M gonna be 200 multiply 200 + -, 4,
two zero and my prediction of those two</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14141-1
02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:08.328
<v Hou, Eric>will be -110.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14151-0
02:15:08.808 --> 02:15:12.888
<v Hou, Eric>And since I have only 300 here and then
my prediction of that residual IS300.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14160-0
02:15:13.208 --> 02:15:15.408
<v Hou, Eric>My prediction of this 400 is going to be
400.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14178-0
02:15:15.408 --> 02:15:20.518
<v Hou, Eric>So when you build a tree,
the prediction of each leaf is simply the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14178-1
02:15:20.518 --> 02:15:23.448
<v Hou, Eric>average of the values in that leaf, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14184-0
02:15:24.258 --> 02:15:26.658
<v Hou, Eric>So you have 10 records.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14196-0
02:15:27.728 --> 02:15:30.848
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say you have still come back to the
house price example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14197-0
02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:31.808
<v Hou, Eric>You have 10 records.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14203-0
02:15:33.378 --> 02:15:34.618
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say 3 records.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14212-0
02:15:34.618 --> 02:15:38.738
<v Hou, Eric>Going to phone here and three records in
here and four records in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14231-0
02:15:40.418 --> 02:15:45.138
<v Hou, Eric>And and we're not really putting the Ys
the house price in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14239-0
02:15:45.178 --> 02:15:48.938
<v Hou, Eric>We're we're putting the residuals in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14251-0
02:15:49.298 --> 02:15:53.519
<v Hou, Eric>So then for those 3 records end up with
this bucket,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14251-1
02:15:53.519 --> 02:15:58.138
<v Hou, Eric>the average of those residuals gonna be
their prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14279-0
02:15:58.568 --> 02:16:02.722
<v Hou, Eric>Around and for those 3 records end up
being here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14279-1
02:16:02.722 --> 02:16:09.285
<v Hou, Eric>The average of those residuals gonna be
their predictions for the residuals so</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14279-2
02:16:09.285 --> 02:16:14.768
<v Hou, Eric>that I have all the residual predictions
from this decision tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14283-0
02:16:16.488 --> 02:16:17.008
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14291-0
02:16:17.288 --> 02:16:20.768
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not predicting actual house price
anymore.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14300-0
02:16:21.088 --> 02:16:27.008
<v Hou, Eric>I'm predicting the residual of the house
price and the previous prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14305-0
02:16:29.008 --> 02:16:32.888
<v Hou, Eric>The next step is I will update.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14325-0
02:16:34.458 --> 02:16:42.457
<v Hou, Eric>My prediction by adding my prediction of
residuals back to my previous prediction</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14325-1
02:16:42.457 --> 02:16:45.578
<v Hou, Eric>and I will update my prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14343-0
02:16:46.748 --> 02:16:55.583
<v Hou, Eric>And I'm hoping that my predictions are
always getting closer and closer to the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14343-1
02:16:55.583 --> 02:16:57.148
<v Hou, Eric>actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14361-0
02:16:58.698 --> 02:17:05.035
<v Hou, Eric>Controlled by these learning rate,
if the learning rate is a big number,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14361-1
02:17:05.035 --> 02:17:06.858
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna go big steps.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14377-0
02:17:07.258 --> 02:17:10.062
<v Hou, Eric>But if the learning rate are smaller
numbers,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14377-1
02:17:10.062 --> 02:17:13.658
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna go small steps getting closer to
my actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14397-0
02:17:14.828 --> 02:17:21.099
<v Hou, Eric>So the take away of this step is I'm
going to refresh my predictions and keep</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14397-1
02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:22.868
<v Hou, Eric>the iteration running.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14406-0
02:17:23.828 --> 02:17:25.188
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you one example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14410-0
02:17:25.188 --> 02:17:27.508
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully that example gonna help you
understand.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14422-0
02:17:29.178 --> 02:17:34.018
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the my data I start with right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14430-0
02:17:34.018 --> 02:17:35.898
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have those house sizes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14446-0
02:17:35.898 --> 02:17:40.305
<v Hou, Eric>That's consistent data that we we have
seen and this is my number of rooms,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14446-1
02:17:40.305 --> 02:17:43.378
<v Hou, Eric>this is my year built and those are my
house prices.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14465-0
02:17:44.748 --> 02:17:49.930
<v Hou, Eric>Remember my prediction as Matt just
mentioned will be the average of those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14465-1
02:17:49.930 --> 02:17:50.828
<v Hou, Eric>house prices.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14482-0
02:17:50.828 --> 02:17:56.160
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
this is really the average of those</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14482-1
02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.748
<v Hou, Eric>prices is a constant value 210,732.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14486-0
02:18:01.298 --> 02:18:03.138
<v Hou, Eric>Same value across the board.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14508-0
02:18:04.858 --> 02:18:10.058
<v Hou, Eric>I will be calculating residual which is a
fancy name of saying the difference</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14508-1
02:18:10.058 --> 02:18:13.058
<v Hou, Eric>between the actual value and my
predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14514-0
02:18:13.748 --> 02:18:15.388
<v Hou, Eric>So that will be this number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14535-0
02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:26.408
<v Hou, Eric>213,397 -, 210,
732 so that give me this number residual.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14557-0
02:18:27.978 --> 02:18:32.938
<v Hou, Eric>And this 275,000 -,
210 I give this number of residuals.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14559-0
02:18:33.298 --> 02:18:36.858
<v Hou, Eric>So this residuals along with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14566-0
02:18:40.608 --> 02:18:45.648
<v Hou, Eric>My input X those are my X.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14581-0
02:18:48.378 --> 02:18:55.298
<v Hou, Eric>This my input X along with my residuals
going to be the input for the tree model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14589-0
02:18:55.298 --> 02:18:59.698
<v Hou, Eric>I am not learning the house price anymore.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14595-0
02:19:00.058 --> 02:19:02.338
<v Hou, Eric>I am learning my residuals.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14619-0
02:19:02.338 --> 02:19:07.822
<v Hou, Eric>I am hoping to have those input
information to explain why I have such</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14619-1
02:19:07.822 --> 02:19:13.538
<v Hou, Eric>big residual or such big difference and
why I have such small difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14624-0
02:19:14.378 --> 02:19:17.498
<v Hou, Eric>So I will build a tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14649-0
02:19:18.368 --> 02:19:24.864
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon how size number bedrooms in
your build to predict the difference</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14649-1
02:19:24.864 --> 02:19:29.566
<v Hou, Eric>between house price and averages of those
house price,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14649-2
02:19:29.566 --> 02:19:32.728
<v Hou, Eric>which is the residual for round zero.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14656-0
02:19:34.298 --> 02:19:35.218
<v Hou, Eric>And this is my tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14675-0
02:19:35.778 --> 02:19:40.912
<v Hou, Eric>I'm saying if house size less than equal
to this number,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14675-1
02:19:40.912 --> 02:19:45.956
<v Hou, Eric>if it's true and if the house size is
even smaller. OK,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14675-2
02:19:45.956 --> 02:19:48.298
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna given this number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14706-0
02:19:48.688 --> 02:19:53.424
<v Hou, Eric>-93,
000 if this bigger than a 12125 square</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14706-1
02:19:53.424 --> 02:20:01.928
<v Hou, Eric>feet but less than 16163 square feet.
I'm gonna give this residual prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14735-0
02:20:03.498 --> 02:20:11.579
<v Hou, Eric>If this one if this house bigger than
16163 square feet but less than equal to</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14735-1
02:20:11.579 --> 02:20:17.818
<v Hou, Eric>23176 square feet,
I'm gonna give this 7251 as the residual.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14747-0
02:20:18.768 --> 02:20:22.888
<v Hou, Eric>And this so this is how you should be
reading this tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14764-0
02:20:23.488 --> 02:20:29.852
<v Hou, Eric>So then I am going to plug back those
residuals back to this table.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14764-1
02:20:29.852 --> 02:20:33.408
<v Hou, Eric>I have the prediction equal to one OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14768-0
02:20:33.528 --> 02:20:34.088
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14780-0
02:20:34.928 --> 02:20:40.128
<v Hou, Eric>I have my prediction 0 equal to 210 seven
32.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14786-0
02:20:40.368 --> 02:20:44.528
<v Hou, Eric>That is my average of all the house
prices.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14791-0
02:20:45.798 --> 02:20:47.598
<v Hou, Eric>I have not my prediction 0.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14797-0
02:20:49.138 --> 02:20:50.978
<v Hou, Eric>The residual 1 prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14801-0
02:20:52.658 --> 02:20:54.458
<v Hou, Eric>For this House, for example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14805-0
02:20:56.258 --> 02:20:56.978
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry, not this one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14816-0
02:21:01.108 --> 02:21:03.908
<v Hou, Eric>For this one, for this for this result,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14824-0
02:21:03.908 --> 02:21:06.348
<v Hou, Eric>So then the how size is 200.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14829-0
02:21:06.348 --> 02:21:10.068
<v Hou, Eric>The 2126 go back to this tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14854-0
02:21:11.618 --> 02:21:16.856
<v Hou, Eric>So that is one's house size bigger than
this number 1600,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14854-1
02:21:16.856 --> 02:21:20.378
<v Hou, Eric>but less than this number 2324 hundred.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14864-0
02:21:20.698 --> 02:21:26.578
<v Hou, Eric>So then my prediction of the residual is
72151.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14868-0
02:21:28.138 --> 02:21:28.778
<v Hou, Eric>$51.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14874-0
02:21:29.958 --> 02:21:32.078
<v Hou, Eric>That is my or 52.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14878-0
02:21:32.188 --> 02:21:32.988
<v Hou, Eric>I drown it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14880-0
02:21:33.068 --> 02:21:35.188
<v Hou, Eric>That is my residual prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14895-0
02:21:36.588 --> 02:21:46.108
<v Hou, Eric>So I I will choose my learning rate as -1,
I will refresh my prediction one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14906-0
02:21:47.678 --> 02:21:51.438
<v Hou, Eric>As my previous prediction which is
average of all house prices.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14912-0
02:21:53.478 --> 02:21:55.518
<v Hou, Eric>Check plus my learning rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14927-0
02:21:57.318 --> 02:22:02.438
<v Hou, Eric>Check multiply my prediction of my
residuals for this house.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14932-0
02:22:02.558 --> 02:22:06.118
<v Hou, Eric>Check and then this going to be my.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14935-0
02:22:07.088 --> 02:22:08.008
<v Hou, Eric>Prediction one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14938-0
02:22:09.548 --> 02:22:10.348
<v Hou, Eric>Like this?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14965-0
02:22:12.028 --> 02:22:24.708
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And then I will check the 2nd house,
2459 square feet go back to my table, OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14969-0
02:22:25.028 --> 02:22:27.028
<v Hou, Eric>So this is sorry, it is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14973-0
02:22:27.028 --> 02:22:27.948
<v Hou, Eric>It's a big house.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14977-0
02:22:27.948 --> 02:22:28.788
<v Hou, Eric>It's bigger than that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14990-0
02:22:28.788 --> 02:22:35.788
<v Hou, Eric>So then my residual is a 61661 thousand
688.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14992-0
02:22:35.788 --> 02:22:36.508
<v Hou, Eric>I will add that in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14994-0
02:22:37.718 --> 02:22:38.198
<v Hou, Eric>And.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/14997-0
02:22:40.908 --> 02:22:42.388
<v Hou, Eric>That's my predictions.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15010-0
02:22:43.958 --> 02:22:49.638
<v Hou, Eric>And and my prediction one will be
prediction zero average plus .1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15019-0
02:22:51.278 --> 02:22:51.838
<v Hou, Eric>My learning rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15024-0
02:22:51.838 --> 02:22:55.678
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply this and I will update my
prediction. One will be this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15032-0
02:22:57.358 --> 02:22:58.398
<v Hou, Eric>So keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15040-0
02:22:58.398 --> 02:23:04.958
<v Hou, Eric>You can refresh all the predictions from
row one to from the top to the bottom.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15054-0
02:23:06.908 --> 02:23:12.508
<v Hou, Eric>The next step is you still calculate the
rescission 2, which is the house price.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15070-0
02:23:14.078 --> 02:23:18.904
<v Hou, Eric>Which the difference between the house
price and then your second version called</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15070-1
02:23:18.904 --> 02:23:19.798
<v Hou, Eric>Prediction one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15093-0
02:23:19.798 --> 02:23:26.015
<v Hou, Eric>But this is really a second version of
your prediction that will be this 213,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15093-1
02:23:26.015 --> 02:23:30.318
<v Hou, Eric>000 -, 211,000.
You have a residual 2 and keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15096-0
02:23:31.958 --> 02:23:32.718
<v Hou, Eric>And as you can see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15124-0
02:23:34.508 --> 02:23:42.432
<v Hou, Eric>My residual one for this first record is
a 2600 and now it's 1900 and this one is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15124-1
02:23:42.432 --> 02:23:43.108
<v Hou, Eric>64,000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15139-0
02:23:43.108 --> 02:23:49.028
<v Hou, Eric>This one is 58,
000 and then this one is a sixty 960,900.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15162-0
02:23:49.028 --> 02:23:52.795
<v Hou, Eric>This one is 60,100,
though for those 3 records the the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15162-1
02:23:52.795 --> 02:23:57.658
<v Hou, Eric>residuals are kind of smaller,
meaning my prediction is getting closer</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15162-2
02:23:57.658 --> 02:23:59.028
<v Hou, Eric>to the actual value.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15168-0
02:23:59.838 --> 02:24:02.878
<v Hou, Eric>But for this this this one is getting
bigger.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15180-0
02:24:03.108 --> 02:24:06.908
<v Hou, Eric>This is really one getting worse and this
one is also getting bigger.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15186-0
02:24:06.908 --> 02:24:10.988
<v Hou, Eric>The residual gets smaller residual,
getting smaller pretty much like.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15198-0
02:24:12.558 --> 02:24:16.598
<v Hou, Eric>Majority of them I have better prediction,
OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15211-0
02:24:17.278 --> 02:24:25.758
<v Hou, Eric>So then from the prediction one so then I
can use this residual 2 along with.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15215-0
02:24:27.518 --> 02:24:29.038
<v Hou, Eric>All the access here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15223-0
02:24:30.798 --> 02:24:34.558
<v Hou, Eric>That will be the input data for the
second tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15245-0
02:24:35.698 --> 02:24:40.969
<v Hou, Eric>I will keep learning how I can use this
House size, number,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15245-1
02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:45.098
<v Hou, Eric>bedrooms and yearbu to explain the
residual 2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15255-0
02:24:46.098 --> 02:24:50.938
<v Hou, Eric>I will have another tree and I will
refresh my prediction again.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15269-0
02:24:51.418 --> 02:24:59.357
<v Hou, Eric>I will refresh appreciation again again.
So eventually I build so many trees I can</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15269-1
02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:00.218
<v Hou, Eric>see that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15280-0
02:25:00.998 --> 02:25:04.718
<v Hou, Eric>My square error is getting job job job 2.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15282-0
02:25:05.268 --> 02:25:05.908
<v Hou, Eric>The bottom.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15302-0
02:25:07.558 --> 02:25:14.341
<v Hou, Eric>And I can see that here this House size,
those are actual values and then my my</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15302-1
02:25:14.341 --> 02:25:19.598
<v Hou, Eric>prediction is getting closer and closer
to the actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15305-0
02:25:21.198 --> 02:25:21.638
<v Hou, Eric>Which is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15330-0
02:25:21.638 --> 02:25:27.547
<v Hou, Eric>Which is good, which is as expected,
right and and if you you you do the same</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15330-1
02:25:27.547 --> 02:25:31.864
<v Hou, Eric>number of trees 20 but you change the
learning rate to .</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15330-2
02:25:31.864 --> 02:25:33.758
<v Hou, Eric>05 which is half of them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15336-0
02:25:34.348 --> 02:25:37.108
<v Hou, Eric>You can see, you know we are learning.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15358-0
02:25:38.678 --> 02:25:44.068
<v Hou, Eric>In in a shorter stab and the quality,
even with the same number of trees,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15358-1
02:25:44.068 --> 02:25:48.438
<v Hou, Eric>is actually the quality is worse than
higher learning rate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15390-0
02:25:48.438 --> 02:25:54.117
<v Hou, Eric>So then you for for lower learning rate
you need more trees to get it converge</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15390-1
02:25:54.117 --> 02:25:57.567
<v Hou, Eric>right?
So that eventually gonna give you pretty</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15390-2
02:25:57.567 --> 02:26:01.448
<v Hou, Eric>good results.
So getting closer closer to you to your</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15390-3
02:26:01.448 --> 02:26:02.598
<v Hou, Eric>actual price so.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15394-0
02:26:03.758 --> 02:26:04.958
<v Hou, Eric>This whole concept let me just.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15402-0
02:26:05.738 --> 02:26:09.218
<v Hou, Eric>Stop here and and and recall what we have
done. Right so then.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15426-0
02:26:10.838 --> 02:26:16.713
<v Hou, Eric>We have our initial guess, the concept,
the mindset of this gradient boosting is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15426-1
02:26:16.713 --> 02:26:18.598
<v Hou, Eric>we have our initial guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15433-0
02:26:18.598 --> 02:26:21.398
<v Hou, Eric>The initial guess can be, in theory,
anything.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15441-0
02:26:21.998 --> 02:26:26.358
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly, $300,000 is a good number,
honestly, and that's not bad.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15454-0
02:26:27.158 --> 02:26:30.954
<v Hou, Eric>But in this in this in this algorithm you
said OK that just use that,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15454-1
02:26:30.954 --> 02:26:32.038
<v Hou, Eric>just use average OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15455-0
02:26:32.038 --> 02:26:33.118
<v Hou, Eric>Let's use average.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15461-0
02:26:33.838 --> 02:26:35.958
<v Hou, Eric>We have a initial guess app initial guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15476-0
02:26:37.028 --> 02:26:44.028
<v Hou, Eric>And then we calculate how bad my initial
guess is to the actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15490-0
02:26:45.598 --> 02:26:50.118
<v Hou, Eric>I want use information I collected as my
ex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15511-0
02:26:50.118 --> 02:26:55.853
<v Hou, Eric>The Axis how size, number, bedrooms,
year built to explain why for some cases</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15511-1
02:26:55.853 --> 02:27:00.558
<v Hou, Eric>I have a really bad prediction,
meaning the residual is so big.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15524-0
02:27:02.438 --> 02:27:06.891
<v Hou, Eric>And why some of the case I have a so
small a residuals meaning the residual is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15524-1
02:27:06.891 --> 02:27:07.398
<v Hou, Eric>so small.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15558-0
02:27:07.668 --> 02:27:12.907
<v Hou, Eric>How can they tell using the data I have
which is which because I if I figured</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15558-1
02:27:12.907 --> 02:27:18.145
<v Hou, Eric>that out I can tell what is the factor
driving high house price with a factor</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15558-2
02:27:18.145 --> 02:27:20.428
<v Hou, Eric>driving the low house price right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15567-0
02:27:20.428 --> 02:27:23.268
<v Hou, Eric>So then we are using the information to
explain the difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15587-0
02:27:23.748 --> 02:27:29.276
<v Hou, Eric>The bad quality of my first ever gas and
then I I learn from it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15587-1
02:27:29.276 --> 02:27:33.868
<v Hou, Eric>I learn from what you know the my my
failures, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15589-0
02:27:34.108 --> 02:27:35.068
<v Hou, Eric>I learn from the failures.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15591-0
02:27:35.878 --> 02:27:36.438
<v Hou, Eric>I get better.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15596-0
02:27:37.298 --> 02:27:38.938
<v Hou, Eric>I give you another prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15603-0
02:27:40.278 --> 02:27:42.678
<v Hou, Eric>I then compare my prediction to the
actual values.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15607-0
02:27:44.238 --> 02:27:45.078
<v Hou, Eric>It won't be perfect.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15617-0
02:27:45.078 --> 02:27:48.598
<v Hou, Eric>I still get some of them are getting good,
some are getting bad.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15629-0
02:27:49.158 --> 02:27:54.798
<v Hou, Eric>So then I relearn it is really like how
you got yourself improved.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15636-0
02:27:54.798 --> 02:27:56.438
<v Hou, Eric>You go to gym, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15659-0
02:27:56.438 --> 02:28:01.403
<v Hou, Eric>So then the first thing you feel oh so
tired. And then and then you, you you,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15659-1
02:28:01.403 --> 02:28:05.158
<v Hou, Eric>you recover first gym and the second day
you get stronger.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15668-0
02:28:05.238 --> 02:28:08.706
<v Hou, Eric>The third day you get stronger to
whatever person you want to build</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15668-1
02:28:08.706 --> 02:28:09.318
<v Hou, Eric>yourself to.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15684-0
02:28:10.028 --> 02:28:12.400
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So there's a sort of a similar mindset.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15684-1
02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:14.468
<v Hou, Eric>You know, the first thing gonna be tough.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15688-0
02:28:14.468 --> 02:28:15.348
<v Hou, Eric>It won't be perfect.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15698-0
02:28:15.348 --> 02:28:19.788
<v Hou, Eric>And then you know how uncomfortable that
first day is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15701-0
02:28:19.788 --> 02:28:20.788
<v Hou, Eric>You learn from it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15702-0
02:28:20.788 --> 02:28:21.788
<v Hou, Eric>You getting better.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15719-0
02:28:21.788 --> 02:28:24.804
<v Hou, Eric>You get prepared for the second day,
1/3 day a fourth day,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15719-1
02:28:24.804 --> 02:28:27.206
<v Hou, Eric>and then that's really the the, the, the,
the,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15719-2
02:28:27.206 --> 02:28:29.148
<v Hou, Eric>the mindset of this gradient boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15738-0
02:28:30.918 --> 02:28:36.678
<v Hou, Eric>And Y gradient gradient is really where
we're taking the derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15746-0
02:28:37.038 --> 02:28:40.878
<v Hou, Eric>And here and this is some part of a
derivative and that derivative.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15753-0
02:28:42.478 --> 02:28:44.958
<v Hou, Eric>For this example,
turns to be the difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15766-0
02:28:45.878 --> 02:28:50.718
<v Hou, Eric>And that is really helping us because
what we use the derivative already.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15790-0
02:28:52.278 --> 02:28:55.611
<v Hou, Eric>The same concept we use in in gradient
descent, but in this very example,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15790-1
02:28:55.611 --> 02:28:59.078
<v Hou, Eric>based upon our definition of a loss
function, it's just a simple difference.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15797-0
02:28:59.078 --> 02:29:03.078
<v Hou, Eric>So that's really helping us and that's
really good, right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15809-0
02:29:05.078 --> 02:29:10.438
<v Hou, Eric>That's why we have this gradient boosting
in plain English.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15815-0
02:29:10.558 --> 02:29:12.078
<v Hou, Eric>Start with the first guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15831-0
02:29:13.158 --> 02:29:18.905
<v Hou, Eric>You calculate the mistakes you build,
make the tree to fix the mistakes and you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15831-1
02:29:18.905 --> 02:29:23.358
<v Hou, Eric>update your your your prediction and you
repeat the progress.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15837-0
02:29:24.118 --> 02:29:24.998
<v Hou, Eric>That's how we work.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15839-0
02:29:25.678 --> 02:29:27.038
<v Hou, Eric>That's literally how it works.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15851-0
02:29:28.958 --> 02:29:32.152
<v Hou, Eric>I I think it's good because you're you're
always learn from your mistakes and then</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15851-1
02:29:32.152 --> 02:29:32.998
<v Hou, Eric>you're getting better.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15855-0
02:29:33.958 --> 02:29:35.558
<v Hou, Eric>This is a gradient boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15857-0
02:29:37.438 --> 02:29:38.078
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15871-0
02:29:46.448 --> 02:29:50.907
<v Hou, Eric>Alright,
so last model we will be talking about is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15871-1
02:29:50.907 --> 02:29:52.568
<v Hou, Eric>called extra boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15884-0
02:29:52.888 --> 02:29:57.808
<v Hou, Eric>I will skip a lot of slides about
actually boost you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15886-0
02:29:57.808 --> 02:29:59.208
<v Hou, Eric>Feel free to read them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15907-0
02:30:01.278 --> 02:30:05.347
<v Hou, Eric>Spend two or three hours and do the
calculate calculus.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15907-1
02:30:05.347 --> 02:30:08.398
<v Hou, Eric>You figured out everything, so let me see.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15913-0
02:30:08.678 --> 02:30:11.318
<v Hou, Eric>So let's just take a step back, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15922-0
02:30:11.318 --> 02:30:14.678
<v Hou, Eric>So then what is an ideal model we want,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15924-0
02:30:14.678 --> 02:30:16.238
<v Hou, Eric>So the ideal model is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15926-0
02:30:17.588 --> 02:30:18.308
<v Hou, Eric>This one.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15939-0
02:30:18.308 --> 02:30:22.988
<v Hou, Eric>This one is basically a loss function.
The ideal model is it should be accurate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15945-0
02:30:24.558 --> 02:30:25.398
<v Hou, Eric>It should be accurate.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15963-0
02:30:27.158 --> 02:30:33.000
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's why we are building models
and this one is telling us it's a</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15963-1
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.558
<v Hou, Eric>regularization term.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15971-0
02:30:35.038 --> 02:30:38.878
<v Hou, Eric>It's basically telling us it cannot be
super complicated.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15976-0
02:30:40.478 --> 02:30:42.318
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot have like.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15982-0
02:30:44.638 --> 02:30:46.198
<v Hou, Eric>Adapt equal to 100.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15984-0
02:30:46.198 --> 02:30:47.158
<v Hou, Eric>That kind of tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15989-0
02:30:48.478 --> 02:30:50.798
<v Hou, Eric>It should be somewhat simple.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15993-0
02:30:51.198 --> 02:30:52.918
<v Hou, Eric>Well, not overly complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/15997-0
02:30:52.918 --> 02:30:54.798
<v Hou, Eric>That's what we want.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16032-0
02:30:55.158 --> 02:31:01.078
<v Hou, Eric>We want an accurate model. We hold.
The model is not super complex and if</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16032-1
02:31:01.078 --> 02:31:06.118
<v Hou, Eric>this complex and then it's easy,
it's prone to to overfitting,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16032-2
02:31:06.118 --> 02:31:12.038
<v Hou, Eric>so that we really hope that we can
penalize this complexity of this model</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16032-3
02:31:12.038 --> 02:31:13.638
<v Hou, Eric>where if you recall.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16036-0
02:31:14.438 --> 02:31:15.958
<v Hou, Eric>In grading, boosting, we didn't do that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16044-0
02:31:17.798 --> 02:31:20.278
<v Hou, Eric>Is it possible that for grading boosting
we can?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16056-0
02:31:20.588 --> 02:31:25.189
<v Hou, Eric>We can over fit it,
but for Adda boost we do not have this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16056-1
02:31:25.189 --> 02:31:26.748
<v Hou, Eric>overfitting problem.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16060-0
02:31:26.748 --> 02:31:28.308
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16072-0
02:31:28.308 --> 02:31:32.113
<v Hou, Eric>We're just building stumps and stumps,
has only adaptive code of one and two</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16072-1
02:31:32.113 --> 02:31:32.508
<v Hou, Eric>outcome.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16075-0
02:31:33.598 --> 02:31:34.878
<v Hou, Eric>For random forest, yeah.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16093-0
02:31:34.878 --> 02:31:39.508
<v Hou, Eric>So we definitely may be overfitting
because we have no control over each tree</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16093-1
02:31:39.508 --> 02:31:42.238
<v Hou, Eric>building upon that bootstrapping data set
OK.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16101-0
02:31:42.398 --> 02:31:44.798
<v Hou, Eric>So the goal is we want to have an
accurate model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16116-0
02:31:44.958 --> 02:31:49.181
<v Hou, Eric>The goal is we hope the model is not
super complex and then we should penalize</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16116-1
02:31:49.181 --> 02:31:50.678
<v Hou, Eric>the complexity of the model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16135-0
02:31:52.308 --> 02:31:58.154
<v Hou, Eric>That's why we make some definition of
this of this object,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16135-1
02:31:58.154 --> 02:32:03.108
<v Hou, Eric>and then we will optimize the object by
choosing.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16138-0
02:32:03.618 --> 02:32:05.858
<v Hou, Eric>The tree by.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16149-0
02:32:08.148 --> 02:32:11.708
<v Hou, Eric>Thoughtfully,
thoroughly defining or designing the tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16156-0
02:32:12.228 --> 02:32:15.508
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm just saying, say, OK,
I'm gonna assume good, all right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16162-0
02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:19.028
<v Hou, Eric>Next up, we got to skip.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16197-0
02:32:19.708 --> 02:32:24.830
<v Hou, Eric>We just go through this tab our our
entire gradient boosting tree is we have</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16197-1
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:28.554
<v Hou, Eric>the first guess,
we we we learn from first guess and we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16197-2
02:32:28.554 --> 02:32:32.877
<v Hou, Eric>get the first guess better.
We have the second guess and then we</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16197-3
02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:36.868
<v Hou, Eric>learn from the difference between the
second guess and the.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16201-0
02:32:36.868 --> 02:32:37.508
<v Hou, Eric>Actual we make the second guess.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16206-0
02:32:37.938 --> 02:32:40.418
<v Hou, Eric>That is our third guess and we keep going.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16218-0
02:32:40.418 --> 02:32:46.088
<v Hou, Eric>This process is basically telling you
that I build new gas based upon my</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16218-1
02:32:46.088 --> 02:32:47.098
<v Hou, Eric>previous gas.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16220-0
02:32:47.698 --> 02:32:48.258
<v Hou, Eric>That's what we do.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16226-0
02:32:49.828 --> 02:32:50.628
<v Hou, Eric>That's literally we do.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16232-0
02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:53.108
<v Hou, Eric>And then there are some tailor expansion.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16234-0
02:32:53.108 --> 02:32:54.308
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to skip that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16236-0
02:32:54.308 --> 02:32:55.268
<v Hou, Eric>It's going to skip.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16245-0
02:32:56.858 --> 02:33:01.178
<v Hou, Eric>So then eventually from this data we
found a way.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16247-0
02:33:01.418 --> 02:33:03.458
<v Hou, Eric>Dad, you know what?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16259-0
02:33:05.148 --> 02:33:10.788
<v Hou, Eric>There is a way to define a good tree that
is falling.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16271-0
02:33:10.788 --> 02:33:15.708
<v Hou, Eric>This weight is going from formula
eventually end up with some formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16291-0
02:33:16.308 --> 02:33:24.079
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to skip this is not important
and and and this is the way how you go</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16291-1
02:33:24.079 --> 02:33:29.588
<v Hou, Eric>from the root node to the left node and
the right hand.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16295-0
02:33:30.548 --> 02:33:32.068
<v Hou, Eric>Run right hand side node.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16305-0
02:33:32.578 --> 02:33:37.178
<v Hou, Eric>Just basically following his formula
Complex I understand.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16316-0
02:33:37.338 --> 02:33:43.058
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I'm gonna ignore and this
entire progress is called extra boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16333-0
02:33:43.258 --> 02:33:46.937
<v Hou, Eric>This is based upon one paper published in
2016,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16333-1
02:33:46.937 --> 02:33:51.458
<v Hou, Eric>and if you're interested in that I can
send you the paper.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16339-0
02:33:53.028 --> 02:33:54.148
<v Hou, Eric>But what does it mean for us?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16343-0
02:33:54.508 --> 02:33:55.948
<v Hou, Eric>What does it mean for us?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16351-0
02:33:56.228 --> 02:33:57.868
<v Hou, Eric>You can ignore all of this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16355-0
02:33:58.388 --> 02:34:02.548
<v Hou, Eric>So then they actually define a concept
called gain.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16364-0
02:34:03.188 --> 02:34:07.548
<v Hou, Eric>And turns out the game concept is super
easy.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16380-0
02:34:09.108 --> 02:34:13.194
<v Hou, Eric>Even though we have gone through the
entire complex math, however,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16380-1
02:34:13.194 --> 02:34:16.548
<v Hou, Eric>this game concept is so easy it's
literally like this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16418-0
02:34:19.128 --> 02:34:25.282
<v Hou, Eric>No matter how you split a tree,
whatever residuals in this left hand side</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16418-1
02:34:25.282 --> 02:34:31.851
<v Hou, Eric>tree I've done sum of them up and square
it and divide the number of record in</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16418-2
02:34:31.851 --> 02:34:38.088
<v Hou, Eric>this left hand side tree and plus my
Lambda which is my my regularization.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16422-0
02:34:39.588 --> 02:34:40.228
<v Hou, Eric>Penalty factor.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16446-0
02:34:42.028 --> 02:34:47.016
<v Hou, Eric>And I going to sum up all the residuals
in the right hand side tree and square it</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16446-1
02:34:47.016 --> 02:34:50.908
<v Hou, Eric>divided by the total number of the
residuals fall in this tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16451-0
02:34:52.418 --> 02:34:54.898
<v Hou, Eric>That will be my gang.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16464-0
02:34:56.538 --> 02:35:03.669
<v Hou, Eric>What is the best way of building the
extra booster tree is to maximize this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16464-1
02:35:03.669 --> 02:35:04.138
<v Hou, Eric>game.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16469-0
02:35:05.778 --> 02:35:06.778
<v Hou, Eric>This is one example.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16473-0
02:35:06.778 --> 02:35:08.578
<v Hou, Eric>Remember we have this table.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16476-0
02:35:08.738 --> 02:35:10.018
<v Hou, Eric>We have our first cast.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16492-0
02:35:10.458 --> 02:35:15.392
<v Hou, Eric>We have our residuals and then this is
one example we use for the gradient</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16492-1
02:35:15.392 --> 02:35:16.378
<v Hou, Eric>boosting right.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16498-0
02:35:16.818 --> 02:35:20.738
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say the house size bigger than
2000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16506-0
02:35:20.738 --> 02:35:25.018
<v Hou, Eric>That means this one bigger than 2000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16523-0
02:35:25.658 --> 02:35:29.112
<v Hou, Eric>I'll put this residual on the left hand
side and let's say yes,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16523-1
02:35:29.112 --> 02:35:32.458
<v Hou, Eric>yes and then say yeah, there's no. OK,
I put a residual here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16529-0
02:35:33.268 --> 02:35:35.108
<v Hou, Eric>There's a two house and a 400.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16533-0
02:35:35.498 --> 02:35:36.938
<v Hou, Eric>Is bigger than 2000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16540-0
02:35:37.418 --> 02:35:39.298
<v Hou, Eric>How poor is residual here?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16582-0
02:35:39.658 --> 02:35:43.601
<v Hou, Eric>So then whenever I have a house size
bigger than 2000,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16582-1
02:35:43.601 --> 02:35:49.337
<v Hou, Eric>I put those residuals here left inside
the summation of those residuals is this</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16582-2
02:35:49.337 --> 02:35:55.216
<v Hou, Eric>big number and how many residuals I have
in this left hand side note I have a one</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16582-3
02:35:55.216 --> 02:35:56.578
<v Hou, Eric>to 10, I have a 10.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16586-0
02:35:56.578 --> 02:35:56.858
<v Hou, Eric>Of them.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16593-0
02:35:57.658 --> 02:36:01.258
<v Hou, Eric>Similarly,
if those house size lower than 2000.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16608-0
02:36:02.508 --> 02:36:07.228
<v Hou, Eric>Lower than 2000 square feet I just put in
here and I have a negative number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16615-0
02:36:07.738 --> 02:36:08.938
<v Hou, Eric>I have five of those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16621-0
02:36:08.938 --> 02:36:12.538
<v Hou, Eric>Record the formula is I have this
summation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16625-0
02:36:12.538 --> 02:36:13.538
<v Hou, Eric>I ^2 it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16641-0
02:36:13.538 --> 02:36:21.498
<v Hou, Eric>Divide by a total number of records in
here and I define my Lambda equal to 1.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16645-0
02:36:21.498 --> 02:36:22.618
<v Hou, Eric>I divide by 11.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16659-0
02:36:22.658 --> 02:36:26.522
<v Hou, Eric>I have a this number and then the the
gain of the right hand side.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16659-1
02:36:26.522 --> 02:36:27.618
<v Hou, Eric>I have this number.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16672-0
02:36:27.978 --> 02:36:31.997
<v Hou, Eric>I calculate the gain of the root is a
zero. I put everything to formula.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16672-1
02:36:31.997 --> 02:36:32.658
<v Hou, Eric>I have this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16688-0
02:36:34.258 --> 02:36:39.482
<v Hou, Eric>And turns out that is not the split way
that give me the biggest again,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16688-1
02:36:39.482 --> 02:36:40.498
<v Hou, Eric>which is this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16692-0
02:36:40.698 --> 02:36:41.818
<v Hou, Eric>So that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16716-0
02:36:41.818 --> 02:36:46.440
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can just split the the data
by doing this game.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16716-1
02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.138
<v Hou, Eric>By doing this condition how size bigger
than 1663 that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16731-0
02:36:52.708 --> 02:36:57.108
<v Hou, Eric>So and keep going can split the data and
then you can build a tree boost tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16737-0
02:36:58.748 --> 02:36:59.588
<v Hou, Eric>Not not super hard.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16748-0
02:37:00.588 --> 02:37:06.868
<v Hou, Eric>And here's a comparison between X tree
boost gradient boosting and random forest.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16752-0
02:37:06.868 --> 02:37:08.228
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I'm comparing those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16755-0
02:37:08.228 --> 02:37:09.548
<v Hou, Eric>Because you can actually build.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16769-0
02:37:10.178 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Hou, Eric>Regression and classification model based
upon those three method, right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16769-1
02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.338
<v Hou, Eric>So as I just talk about.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16789-0
02:37:18.878 --> 02:37:23.541
<v Hou, Eric>Attributes extra boost a gradient boost
and there are sequential models and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16789-1
02:37:23.541 --> 02:37:27.958
<v Hou, Eric>random forest is one of them that you can
do parallel processing right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16793-0
02:37:28.358 --> 02:37:31.198
<v Hou, Eric>So usually extra boot is really fast.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16809-0
02:37:32.748 --> 02:37:35.631
<v Hou, Eric>Because the optimization I you know
there's some optimization behind the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16809-1
02:37:35.631 --> 02:37:35.868
<v Hou, Eric>scene.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16818-0
02:37:35.868 --> 02:37:39.388
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely dive into the math and
then and figure it out yourself.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16822-0
02:37:39.748 --> 02:37:40.428
<v Hou, Eric>Everything is.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16829-0
02:37:40.428 --> 02:37:44.228
<v Hou, Eric>All you need is in slide to figure this
out.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16836-0
02:37:44.508 --> 02:37:47.068
<v Hou, Eric>You don't need anything for your homework
at all.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16840-0
02:37:48.828 --> 02:37:49.628
<v Hou, Eric>And a good news.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16850-0
02:37:49.938 --> 02:37:53.978
<v Hou, Eric>Of attributes is a really low overfitting
risk.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16874-0
02:37:56.748 --> 02:38:01.120
<v Hou, Eric>However, this is integrity,
so the way the way how you interpret the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16874-1
02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:03.908
<v Hou, Eric>tree is also lower since it's more
complex.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16893-0
02:38:03.908 --> 02:38:10.180
<v Hou, Eric>So there are some pro and cons and you
can have to read after class extra boost</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16893-1
02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:13.708
<v Hou, Eric>and gradient boost and random forest,
right?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16903-0
02:38:13.908 --> 02:38:20.428
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the really top three,
top three ensemble tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16927-0
02:38:20.698 --> 02:38:25.329
<v Hou, Eric>Models that pretty much all machine
learning and machine learning engineers</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16927-1
02:38:25.329 --> 02:38:28.498
<v Hou, Eric>are using,
and a lot of data scientists are prefer.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16931-0
02:38:28.658 --> 02:38:30.818
<v Hou, Eric>They do prefer those of three different.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16939-0
02:38:33.348 --> 02:38:34.828
<v Hou, Eric>The decision tree model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16944-0
02:38:34.828 --> 02:38:36.428
<v Hou, Eric>Ensemble Decision tree model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16952-0
02:38:37.228 --> 02:38:39.508
<v Hou, Eric>There's another branch of this gradient
boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16963-0
02:38:39.828 --> 02:38:43.508
<v Hou, Eric>It's called live gpm.
The live gradient boosting machines.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16967-0
02:38:43.828 --> 02:38:46.428
<v Hou, Eric>There's also another pretty popular model
that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16971-0
02:38:48.348 --> 02:38:49.628
<v Hou, Eric>Getting more powerful light.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16973-0
02:38:53.108 --> 02:38:53.228
<v Hou, Eric>Gvm.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16991-0
02:38:55.428 --> 02:38:59.028
<v Hou, Eric>So there's another powerful model on top
of this gradient boosting model.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/16996-0
02:38:59.028 --> 02:39:01.508
<v Hou, Eric>So so light gradient boosting machine.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17022-0
02:39:01.908 --> 02:39:05.178
<v Hou, Eric>So those are,
that's a really powerful tool that a lot</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17022-1
02:39:05.178 --> 02:39:09.816
<v Hou, Eric>of people use and then develop them by by
the Microsoft data scientist group.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17022-2
02:39:09.816 --> 02:39:10.708
<v Hou, Eric>So all of this.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17046-0
02:39:12.618 --> 02:39:17.116
<v Hou, Eric>I'm telling to you is this is one table
you may want to spend some time to read</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17046-1
02:39:17.116 --> 02:39:21.221
<v Hou, Eric>to understand the pros and cons of
different models and then through the</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17046-2
02:39:21.221 --> 02:39:22.458
<v Hou, Eric>slides you understand.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17080-0
02:39:24.028 --> 02:39:29.303
<v Hou, Eric>Random Forest based upon a lot of trees
on bootstrapping data set gradients,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17080-1
02:39:29.303 --> 02:39:32.934
<v Hou, Eric>boost and extra boost is really learning
the errors.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17080-2
02:39:32.934 --> 02:39:35.468
<v Hou, Eric>The residuals from the previous tree.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17081-0
02:39:35.868 --> 02:39:36.428
<v Hou, Eric>That's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17084-0
02:39:37.188 --> 02:39:39.268
<v Hou, Eric>And the actual implementation.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17102-0
02:39:41.598 --> 02:39:47.918
<v Hou, Eric>In the actual implementation,
you don't need to use all those concept.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17113-0
02:39:48.238 --> 02:39:51.367
<v Hou, Eric>Luckily,
the data scientist coders already</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17113-1
02:39:51.367 --> 02:39:54.278
<v Hou, Eric>incorporate those into the actual codes.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17116-0
02:39:55.898 --> 02:39:57.618
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17127-0
02:40:05.688 --> 02:40:09.488
<v Hou, Eric>Me just quickly show you the code and
then I think we're we're done.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17131-0
02:40:11.028 --> 02:40:11.908
<v Hou, Eric>For for today's class.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17137-0
02:40:17.918 --> 02:40:20.598
<v Hou, Eric>So for example, like the gradient boost.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17149-0
02:40:22.508 --> 02:40:24.967
<v Hou, Eric>What? OK,
so this is really talking about gradient</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17149-1
02:40:24.967 --> 02:40:26.268
<v Hou, Eric>boost. I think that's good.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17161-0
02:40:32.818 --> 02:40:36.578
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry,
I just for actually actually boosting.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17183-0
02:40:36.858 --> 02:40:43.038
<v Hou, Eric>So you literally just need to install
this extra boost library and import is</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17183-1
02:40:43.038 --> 02:40:49.378
<v Hou, Eric>actually actually boosting regressor or
classifier, and that's how you use it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17200-0
02:40:49.898 --> 02:40:55.205
<v Hou, Eric>You just define input data, train data,
the features you want to train based upon,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17200-1
02:40:55.205 --> 02:40:58.338
<v Hou, Eric>and then your target and you just plug
you just.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17202-0
02:40:59.148 --> 02:41:00.028
<v Hou, Eric>Enter in here.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17206-0
02:41:01.988 --> 02:41:03.028
<v Hou, Eric>And you want to fit.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17215-0
02:41:03.298 --> 02:41:06.332
<v Hou, Eric>The axe.
You wanna fit the axe as your input</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17215-1
02:41:06.332 --> 02:41:06.938
<v Hou, Eric>features.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17234-0
02:41:08.508 --> 02:41:12.588
<v Hou, Eric>How size, number, bedrooms,
year built and then your target and you</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17234-1
02:41:12.588 --> 02:41:15.228
<v Hou, Eric>can define a tree and you get a
prediction.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17235-0
02:41:15.668 --> 02:41:16.868
<v Hou, Eric>All we covered.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17256-0
02:41:18.948 --> 02:41:22.728
<v Hou, Eric>In our slides are just basically coded
behind those 3 lines of code.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17256-1
02:41:22.728 --> 02:41:25.028
<v Hou, Eric>I I think I think they're doing great job.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17270-0
02:41:25.308 --> 02:41:29.308
<v Hou, Eric>So then we don't have to go line by line
to recall ourselves.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17274-0
02:41:29.308 --> 02:41:32.908
<v Hou, Eric>You can just literally call this function
and and that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17313-0
02:41:33.928 --> 02:41:36.339
<v Hou, Eric>Right,
but the learning rate for this one is so</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17313-1
02:41:36.339 --> 02:41:40.006
<v Hou, Eric>high in this one and then you can
definitely change those parameters and</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17313-2
02:41:40.006 --> 02:41:43.422
<v Hou, Eric>then we can we can have one another
sometime to cover all different</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17313-3
02:41:43.422 --> 02:41:46.888
<v Hou, Eric>parameters under those decision tree.
And then that'll be next time.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17329-0
02:41:48.478 --> 02:41:53.645
<v Hou, Eric>So we gonna cover some examples using
those three tree models and then we can</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17329-1
02:41:53.645 --> 02:41:56.758
<v Hou, Eric>start talking about the next family of
models.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17336-0
02:41:57.388 --> 02:42:01.628
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I think that'll be it for today.
Any questions?</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17339-0
02:42:02.508 --> 02:42:03.628
<v Hou, Eric>I know there's a lot.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17363-0
02:42:05.808 --> 02:42:11.601
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually, you know, you,
you you just need to remember differences</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17363-1
02:42:11.601 --> 02:42:15.568
<v Hou, Eric>of the tree model,
ensemble tree models and pros.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17366-0
02:42:15.968 --> 02:42:16.608
<v Hou, Eric>And that's it.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17393-0
02:42:16.928 --> 02:42:20.391
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have to memorize those math
behind scene,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17393-1
02:42:20.391 --> 02:42:25.518
<v Hou, Eric>but if you wanna know why the pros are
really pros and cons and really cons,</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17393-2
02:42:25.518 --> 02:42:28.448
<v Hou, Eric>the math will help you to understand
those.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17415-0
02:42:29.148 --> 02:42:34.469
<v Hou, Eric>And and math are actually in those slides
and kind of always open and have some fun.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17415-1
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:37.348
<v Hou, Eric>Drink some beer and do some math if you
want.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17421-0
02:42:40.928 --> 02:42:44.248
<v Hou, Eric>All right. If that's the case, I mean,
we're done for today.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17425-0
02:42:48.558 --> 02:42:49.198
<v Benbenek, Matthew>Thank you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17431-0
02:42:49.448 --> 02:42:50.088
<v Severin, Noah>Yeah. Thank you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17432-0
02:42:49.978 --> 02:42:50.538
<v Schembari, John>Thank you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17438-0
02:42:50.018 --> 02:42:51.178
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you enjoy that.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17435-0
02:42:50.078 --> 02:42:50.758
<v Mertens, Aidric>Thanks professor.</v>

<v Carone, Matt>Thank you.</v>

a5592300-e436-4caf-8713-92378a39fa95/17451-0
02:42:53.718 --> 02:42:54.278
<v Weidner, Declan>Appreciated.</v>
