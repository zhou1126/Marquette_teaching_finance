45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/47-0
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:21.459
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/55-0
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.829
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So any issue coming in class?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/56-0
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.789
<v Hou, Eric>I guess no issue, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/58-0
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.219
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/66-0
00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.709
<v Hou, Eric>So how long are you recording it?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/69-0
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:42.789
<v Hou, Eric>Or am I recording it?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/79-0
00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.109
<v Hou, Eric>I just wanna make sure that I will
eventually have the recording to upload.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/89-0
00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.229
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Both of us are gonna have access to the
recording.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/98-0
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.259
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I just started.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/100-0
00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:52.299
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/105-0
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.499
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I'm sorry I can't stop the recording.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/103-0
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:53.619
<v Hou, Eric>OK, that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/108-0
00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.379
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And you could start it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/111-0
00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:57.139
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/115-0
00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.939
<v Hou, Eric>That's good. That's good.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/122-0
00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.619
<v Hou, Eric>So then both of us gonna have the
recording.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/125-0
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:00.179
<v Hou, Eric>That's awesome.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/132-0
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.859
<v Hou, Eric>Just wanted to make sure I have the
recordings and then I gotta upload.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/144-0
00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.349
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the first thing Jeff's
presentation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/175-0
00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is one group just reached to
me today and then pointed out there is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/175-1
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.979
<v Hou, Eric>one one data in the in the first
assignment that group cannot find and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/175-2
00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.749
<v Hou, Eric>that's it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/179-0
00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.949
<v Hou, Eric>That is just a closed price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/184-0
00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.789
<v Hou, Eric>So then I think that that makes sense.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/186-0
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:25.189
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/201-0
00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:30.739
<v Hou, Eric>I just postponed the first homework until
Friday 11:55 PM.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/203-0
00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.749
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/216-0
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.069
<v Hou, Eric>So this so, so then you, well,
whoever ready, submit in.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/219-0
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:41.429
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's totally fine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/228-0
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.349
<v Hou, Eric>You know you you can use close price,
you can use just a close price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/230-0
00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.229
<v Hou, Eric>It's really your assumption I'm fine with
that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/252-0
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.551
<v Hou, Eric>The second homework is already online so
that you can start downloading it and and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/252-1
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.549
<v Hou, Eric>start working on that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/280-0
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
and and also the original thought is I</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/280-1
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.005
<v Hou, Eric>was thinking that we do have the team so
then we can leverage teams to for the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/280-2
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:04.389
<v Hou, Eric>folks to post the questions and then we
can solve together.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/298-0
00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.959
<v Hou, Eric>But that team also remind me that maybe
there is a need for office hour, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/306-0
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.679
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just share my screen.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/316-0
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.943
<v Hou, Eric>Just wanna make sure your availability
and what kind of the best time for the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/316-1
00:02:19.943 --> 00:02:20.599
<v Hou, Eric>office hour.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/326-0
00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:27.829
<v Hou, Eric>What I can do is 4:30 to 5:30, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/334-0
00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.909
<v Hou, Eric>I can do 2 days of the other four days.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/343-0
00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.259
<v Hou, Eric>I just wanna make sure that what two days
work for you guys.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/365-0
00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.043
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think like Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/365-1
00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:46.749
<v Hou, Eric>which we should two of those four days
work for you? The best. Like 4:30 to 5:30.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/394-0
00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.528

4:30 at 5:30 and Thursday,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/394-1
00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:02.808
<v Hou, Eric>4:30 to 5:30 as an office hour,
would that be an issue for you guys to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/394-2
00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:03.329

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.889
<v Hou, Eric>Just you can just come in here,
ask any questions.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/404-0
00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.909
<v Hou, Eric>About homework,
about your project or anything.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/408-0
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.469
<v Hou, Eric>Would those two days work?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/410-0
00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.389
<v Carone, Matt>That works for me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/413-0
00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.379
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/431-0
00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Hou, Eric>So anyone have any issue to attend at
least one of those two days for office</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/431-1

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.589
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/455-0

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/457-0
00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.989
<v Hou, Eric>That would be the office hour.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/465-0
00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.789

<v Hou, Eric>So if you do have any questions please.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/478-0

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/480-0
00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.949
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/488-0
00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Hou, Eric>Alright,
let me just talk about homework a little</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/488-1
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.819
<v Hou, Eric>bit, right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/496-0
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.559
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the homework I sent to you
guys.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/497-0
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.839
<v Hou, Eric>OK so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/510-0
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.149
<v Hou, Eric>There will be some requirement for you
guys to use some data right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/542-0
00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:31.584
<v Hou, Eric>So that if you're if there's really like
a form of French daily factor that you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/542-1
00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:34.301
<v Hou, Eric>can definitely find the data from their
website,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/542-2
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.349
<v Hou, Eric>you can just literally Google from a
French daily factor. Google, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/549-0
00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.949
<v Hou, Eric>French daily factors, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/559-0
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.709
<v Hou, Eric>So then you got here and you can just go
to a database Edu and then they have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/565-0
00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.179
<v Hou, Eric>The daily data for you, it's right there.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/572-0
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:53.699
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can download from as a CSV.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/602-0
00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.991
<v Hou, Eric>And if there's any other data from for
example, like those stock price data,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/602-1
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:06.792
<v Hou, Eric>I do not anticipate,
I do not expect you guys to purchase any</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/602-2
00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:08.109
<v Hou, Eric>membership or so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/613-0
00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:16.829
<v Hou, Eric>What you can do is basically use use this
Class 1 Jupiter notebook, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/637-0
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then what you need to do is you need</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/637-1
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.739
<v Hou, Eric>to really import this library and then
someone maybe asks the question, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/642-0
00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:28.419
<v Hou, Eric>So how am I going to import those
libraries?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/645-0
00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.459
<v Hou, Eric>How do I do that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/650-0
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.219
<v Hou, Eric>OK, let me just give you one example.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/651-0
00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.659
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/664-0
00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.469
<v Hou, Eric>So then hopefully after this example it
won't be an issue for you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/676-0
00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:43.469
<v Hou, Eric>So I hope you have a GitHub GitHub
package with you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/682-0
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.349
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then for example,
you can actually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/684-0
00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:49.339
<v Hou, Eric>Gosh.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/709-0
00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.166
<v Hou, Eric>You can actually create a repository and
then you can even.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/709-1
00:05:55.166 --> 00:06:00.899
<v Hou, Eric>You can even share your repository with
your friend with your group members.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/723-0
00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.139
<v Hou, Eric>And then I do have a repository,
the markup teaching finance, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/733-0
00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.219
<v Hou, Eric>So then what you can do is see there is a
green button of the code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/740-0
00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:13.629
<v Hou, Eric>And then we just delete this one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/747-0
00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:18.729
<v Hou, Eric>So this is in in the code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/763-0
00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:25.681
<v Hou, Eric>You can click here and then GitHub does
offer really convenient infrastructure</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/763-1
00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:27.969
<v Hou, Eric>called code spaces, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/774-0
00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.049
<v Hou, Eric>So the code spaces is a virtual machine
that you can run those Jupyter notebooks.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/791-0
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:40.180
<v Hou, Eric>So you can just basically say, hey,
let me just create a code space on main.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/791-1
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.929
<v Hou, Eric>So if you click that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/801-0
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.149
<v Hou, Eric>And then you're going to set up the the
the virtual machine for you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/837-0
00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.549
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then you're gonna spend some time to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/837-1
00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:56.001
<v Hou, Eric>set up this virtual machine if you're
familiar with, for example,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/837-2
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.845
<v Hou, Eric>the virtual AI of Google.
This is exactly the vertex AI.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/837-3
00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:02.139
<v Hou, Eric>If you're familiar with any other.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/844-0
00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:05.909
<v Hou, Eric>Coding editor on Windows.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/853-0
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.469
<v Hou, Eric>It's sort of the same, no,
no difference at all, right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/864-0
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:14.751
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then just taking one minute,
you have this entire virtual machine set</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/864-1
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:14.949
<v Hou, Eric>up?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/868-0
00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:16.749
<v Hou, Eric>You can change the way how you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/879-0
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.979
<v Hou, Eric>How you work on it.
So it's pretty pretty convenient.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/883-0
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:24.829
<v Hou, Eric>Right. And then?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/894-0
00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.029
<v Hou, Eric>You open those Jupiter notebooks I share
on D2L.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/903-0
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.549
<v Hou, Eric>Usually is.
I just wanna zoom out a little bit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/913-0
00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:37.429
<v Hou, Eric>So then you definitely see I'm importing
this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/920-0
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:41.709
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just open up,
create a 11 new Jupiter notebook.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/922-0
00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:44.269
<v Hou, Eric>Notebook.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/932-0
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:50.059
<v Hou, Eric>The IP OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/943-0
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:54.739
<v Hou, Eric>So now you open this one.
You definitely can copy paste my code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/946-0
00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:56.739
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see you copy this code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/970-0
00:07:56.739 --> 00:08:03.415
<v Hou, Eric>Here you add a code here so then you see
there's one import command you say you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/970-1
00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:06.419
<v Hou, Eric>want to run it. You just click here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/984-0
00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:10.629
<v Hou, Eric>You want to run it and then you gonna ask
you what is the Python environment.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/984-1
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:11.979
<v Hou, Eric>Now you wanna based upon.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1001-0
00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:16.083
<v Hou, Eric>To run this just one line of importing
library command,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1001-1
00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:18.789
<v Hou, Eric>so you can just click the piping
environment.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1008-0
00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:20.219
<v Hou, Eric>And click this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1014-0
00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:23.899
<v Hou, Eric>Recommended is a Python 3 point 13.12.1.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1046-0
00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:29.857
<v Hou, Eric>So that, yes,
you're doing is just import this library</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1046-1
00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:37.766
<v Hou, Eric>and apparently this library finance is
not a library that was installed to this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1046-2
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.139
<v Hou, Eric>to this virtual machine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1074-0
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.391
<v Hou, Eric>Default.
So what you need to do is you know this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1074-1
00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Hou, Eric>is not being so.
Basically this module found error is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1074-2
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.109
<v Hou, Eric>basically saying that you have not
installed this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1096-0
00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:58.875
<v Hou, Eric>This this module or this library what you
need to do is you need to go to this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1096-1
00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.499
<v Hou, Eric>command piece. This called terminal right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1101-0
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.939
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really like you can run some
Linux.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1116-0
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:07.718
<v Hou, Eric>Command.
For example you can say LS is basically</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1116-1
00:09:07.718 --> 00:09:10.469
<v Hou, Eric>what's in your folder and you can see
what's in your folder.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1151-0
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:17.900
<v Hou, Eric>And and you will you can you have two
ways you can install this package here</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1151-1
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.543
<v Hou, Eric>within that notebook or you can just
basically install in this in this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1151-2
00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:24.259
<v Hou, Eric>terminal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1162-0
00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:29.459
<v Hou, Eric>So how you are going to install this is
use a PIP install command.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1165-0
00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:31.979
<v Hou, Eric>So you just type pip install.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1180-0
00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:38.549
<v Hou, Eric>And that's basically the command that you
you will install this package to your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1180-1
00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:39.549
<v Hou, Eric>virtual machine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1196-0
00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:45.129
<v Hou, Eric>And you can literally double click this
WI finance and copy and paste it here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1197-0
00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:46.969
<v Hou, Eric>OK, allow paste.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1207-0
00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:51.729
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then we just so man, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1208-0
00:09:51.729 --> 00:09:53.929
<v Hou, Eric>So you're really Pap installing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1231-0
00:09:55.869 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Hou, Eric>This WI finance pad library so you can
just click enter or return so it will</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1231-1
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.749
<v Hou, Eric>install that library to your virtual
machine right? So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1236-0
00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:09.869
<v Hou, Eric>Just give it some time.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1238-0
00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:13.819
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1254-0
00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:20.184
<v Hou, Eric>Give you some time.
You're going to tell you that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1254-1
00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:22.749
<v Hou, Eric>successfully install this so that you can
restart.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1272-0
00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:28.739
<v Hou, Eric>This Jubilee notebook your your Jubilee
notebook. You can clear all the outputs.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1272-1
00:10:28.739 --> 00:10:29.669
<v Hou, Eric>You can rerun it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1281-0
00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:32.829
<v Hou, Eric>And then you see the check mark.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1285-0
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:35.269
<v Hou, Eric>You know it's run through, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1313-0
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:41.131
<v Hou, Eric>You you just run through this,
this this import command so as you can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1313-1
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:46.323
<v Hou, Eric>see in in my code I have.
I have all of those so that you can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1313-2
00:10:46.323 --> 00:10:49.589
<v Hou, Eric>really copy and paste to your notebook.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1326-0
00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:55.099
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm reloading the Yahoo Finance API.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1354-0
00:10:55.099 --> 00:10:58.139
<v Hou, Eric>I'm really loading this stat model API,
pandas,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1354-1
00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:02.445
<v Hou, Eric>Numpy and daytime and believe those are
the packages that you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1354-2
00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:07.322
<v Hou, Eric>whatever virtual machine you're using on
the GitHub you already have that on</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1354-3
00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:08.019
<v Hou, Eric>default so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1384-0
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:14.154
<v Hou, Eric>Try to fetch data from the start date end
date in different tickers that you want</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1384-1
00:11:14.154 --> 00:11:18.496
<v Hou, Eric>to fetch the data and and you can just
run run it and definitely you will see</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1384-2
00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:20.389
<v Hou, Eric>another error message saying that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1390-0
00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:22.739
<v Hou, Eric>The stat model is not installed.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1400-0
00:11:22.739 --> 00:11:27.539
<v Hou, Eric>So what you do is you go back to this
terminal and you pick install.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1402-0
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.709
<v Hou, Eric>These stat models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1411-0
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:38.659
<v Hou, Eric>So it's successfully installed this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1419-0
00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:41.389
<v Hou, Eric>You can clear that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1422-0
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:42.829
<v Hou, Eric>You can just restart it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1427-0
00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:45.469
<v Hou, Eric>You just rerun it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1446-0
00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:52.096
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see,
Oneonone completed a one-on-one completed</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1446-1
00:11:52.096 --> 00:11:55.769
<v Hou, Eric>and five on five completed.
Because I'm loading I'm fetching like 5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1483-0
00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:02.585
<v Hou, Eric>The stock price data for five of them.
And then what you can do, you can do,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1483-1
00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:07.861
<v Hou, Eric>you can do use the head command to see
actually see how the data looks like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1483-2
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:12.589
<v Hou, Eric>You can see the 1st 5 rows.
Let's say if you wanna see the 1st 10 R.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1493-0
00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:16.429
<v Hou, Eric>They just put the 10 inside the Princess.
You see the 1st 10 rows.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1512-0
00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:20.778
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
the reason Tesla is an age is because we</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1512-1
00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:22.659
<v Hou, Eric>go back to 2010, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1522-0
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:27.779
<v Hou, Eric>So then Tesla was not a public company
yet at that moment, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1530-0
00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.259
<v Hou, Eric>So then. So that's how you load the data,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1542-0
00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:35.299
<v Hou, Eric>So then this Yahoo Finance API is 100%
free.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1553-0
00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:39.379
<v Hou, Eric>You don't need to purchase anything,
you just need to load this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1561-0
00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:43.659
<v Hou, Eric>Use this one and and and download data in
in this way.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1584-0
00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:47.242
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's totally free.
If you want to go.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1584-1
00:12:47.242 --> 00:12:50.753
<v Hou, Eric>If you actually go to the Yahoo Finance
website,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1584-2
00:12:50.753 --> 00:12:53.619
<v Hou, Eric>you may have to pay some money for data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1591-0
00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:57.739
<v Hou, Eric>I I don't think we should be doing that
for this class, OK?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1594-0
00:12:59.299 --> 00:12:59.659
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1600-0
00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:02.659
<v Hou, Eric>So then in case you're using Google Colab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1608-0
00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:08.799
<v Hou, Eric>So, right,
so then you just go to Google Colab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1612-0
00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:14.219
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1616-0
00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:14.699
<v Hou, Eric>I don't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1619-0
00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:16.659
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say you create a new notebook.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1632-0
00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:22.491
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then they they tell you some new</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1632-1
00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:23.619
<v Hou, Eric>features, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1642-0
00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:27.699
<v Hou, Eric>So then definitely you can just copy and
paste the code over there as well.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1645-0
00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:29.499
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just copy this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1647-0
00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:32.129
<v Hou, Eric>The call lab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1654-0
00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:49.219
<v Hou, Eric>To that to here right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1659-0
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:51.579
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then you run it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1666-0
00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:55.899
<v Hou, Eric>He will complain that there is no Yahoo
finance package I guess.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1683-0
00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.839
<v Hou, Eric>Oh OK. So Kolab is smaller, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1699-0
00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:20.494
<v Hou, Eric>So then you already have the Yahoo
finance or stack models installed so that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1699-1
00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:21.359
<v Hou, Eric>you don't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1707-0
00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.839
<v Hou, Eric>You do not have to install those package
yourself.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1716-0
00:14:24.439 --> 00:14:28.879
<v Hou, Eric>And then there's a great feature of Kolab
is Gemini.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1720-0
00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:30.439
<v Hou, Eric>So Gemini is automatically.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1741-0
00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:34.547
<v Hou, Eric>Incorporated in this function and by the
way,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1741-1
00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:39.180
<v Hou, Eric>you can definitely check your system RAM
and your disk and then it seems like it's</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1741-2
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.459
<v Hou, Eric>good.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1746-0
00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.499
<v Hou, Eric>You know you have a 12 gigabyte of RAM.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1767-0
00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:45.587
<v Hou, Eric>It's good enough to run any model that we
want to run here,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1767-1
00:14:45.587 --> 00:14:49.671
<v Hou, Eric>so in case you wanna see the data that
stock data stock, uh stock,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1767-2
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:52.049
<v Hou, Eric>under score data, you can just say hey.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1777-0
00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:57.699
<v Hou, Eric>Kyle, Jim, and I, I want to track the 1st.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1787-0
00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:03.699
<v Hou, Eric>55 rolls of stock under score data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1791-0
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.659
<v Hou, Eric>Boom and then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1813-0
00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:13.207
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
So then you just he just tell you just</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1813-1
00:15:13.207 --> 00:15:19.847
<v Hou, Eric>use the have you can copy here and add a
code well or you can just. Here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1813-2
00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:22.809
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just copy the same prompt.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1825-0
00:15:28.549 --> 00:15:31.428
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, Frank,
you don't actually need a prank by</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1825-1
00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:33.389
<v Hou, Eric>anyways, but phone you have you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1830-0
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:34.869
<v Hou, Eric>You can see the data right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1834-0
00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:35.429
<v Hou, Eric>So do so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1856-0
00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:39.994
<v Hou, Eric>You can just work with Gemini.
You can work with your team to continue</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1856-1
00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:43.016
<v Hou, Eric>coding.
Once you have the data over there with</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1856-2
00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:44.109
<v Hou, Eric>you, right? Just.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1883-0
00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:51.732
<v Hou, Eric>One call out one has up is, you know,
Gemini may not always give you the right</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1883-1
00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:56.865
<v Hou, Eric>answer. OK. You can do Gemini,
but not necessarily they give you 100%</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1883-2
00:15:56.865 --> 00:15:57.819
<v Hou, Eric>right answer.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1894-0
00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:04.319
<v Hou, Eric>So when you decode it,
you may gonna take some time. OK question,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1894-1
00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:04.929
<v Hou, Eric>Haroon.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1920-0
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.665
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Uh,
what's are working directly when we use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1920-1
00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:14.185
<v Haroon, Sufyan>collab?
Because I had trouble using acsb file</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1920-2
00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:16.939
<v Haroon, Sufyan>when I use collab for assignment #1.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1939-0
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:22.249
<v Haroon, Sufyan>And I had to go into contents and is it
possible to make it easy and change the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1924-0
00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:18.019
<v Hou, Eric>Uh huh.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1939-1
00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.689
<v Haroon, Sufyan>working directory there?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1951-0
00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:28.519
<v Hou, Eric>You mean trying to load the data from a
CSV in the call lab?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1953-0
00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:29.409
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1955-0
00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:30.339
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1992-0
00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:36.187
<v Hou, Eric>So usually like the source data we use is
is from and then you can actually import</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1992-1
00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:40.626
<v Hou, Eric>a cargo package and you can directly
download data from cargo.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/1992-2
00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:45.699
<v Hou, Eric>I can show you how to do that as another
another way to work on collab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2009-0
00:16:46.219 --> 00:16:51.517
<v Hou, Eric>You know GitHub will be a a easier way if
you collaborate with your team members.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2009-1
00:16:51.517 --> 00:16:53.779
<v Hou, Eric>Call Lab will be difficult because.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2026-0
00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:57.929
<v Hou, Eric>He's really like your your personal
instance, right? To work on that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2030-0
00:16:58.209 --> 00:16:59.729
<v Hou, Eric>So you decide with your team.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2053-0
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:04.102
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you feel like you guys can
work on the call lab individually and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2053-1
00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:08.649
<v Hou, Eric>eventually use GitHub to really merge
your codes, that's totally fine with me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2070-0
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:14.207
<v Hou, Eric>But in case that you want to load the
data CSV from cargo to collab I I can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2070-1
00:17:14.207 --> 00:17:17.609
<v Hou, Eric>definitely show you how to do that.
It's quite easy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2095-0
00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:24.183
<v Hou, Eric>I I can guess that I'll I'll upload the
code to show you guys how to do that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2095-1
00:17:24.183 --> 00:17:26.549
<v Hou, Eric>directly loading data from Kaggle in in
collab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2100-0
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:28.789
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually work on collab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2121-0
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:33.895
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Would it be possible for you to show me
how to upload it directly from your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2121-1
00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:35.269
<v Haroon, Sufyan>computer rather than Kegel?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2123-0
00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:35.889
<v Hou, Eric>02 here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2126-0
00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:38.289
<v Hou, Eric>I guess you can just upload here, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2128-0
00:17:41.469 --> 00:17:42.349
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Oh, it's that easy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2130-0
00:17:43.469 --> 00:17:43.989
<v Hou, Eric>I guess so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2145-0
00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:51.569
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I had a lot of trouble doing that,
so I didn't right. Thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2143-0
00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:49.629
<v Hou, Eric>Sure.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2150-0
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.979
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you have the data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2162-0
00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Hou, Eric>Right, so copy path. OK,
so you can even do copy path.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2162-1
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.339
<v Hou, Eric>That's awesome.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2171-0
00:18:02.219 --> 00:18:04.219
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see df equals PD.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2174-0
00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:11.439
<v Hou, Eric>You know what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2177-0
00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:19.159
<v Hou, Eric>Is that what you want?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2180-0
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:20.679
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yes, thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2181-0
00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:21.499
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2200-0
00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:28.861
<v Hou, Eric>Question I I'm not quite sure about the
other call lab is. Do you have?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2200-1
00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:30.559
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys have to pay for it?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2204-0
00:18:33.659 --> 00:18:34.379
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2207-0
00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:34.859
<v Hou, Eric>That's good.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2214-0
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:35.939
<v Hou, Eric>I mean 12 gigab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2213-0
00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:35.969
<v Teske, Benjamin>It's free.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2228-0
00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:40.047
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK.
12 gigabytes of RAM and then 107 gigabyte</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2228-1
00:18:40.047 --> 00:18:43.499
<v Hou, Eric>of disk hard drive. That's awesome. Enjoy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2235-0
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:46.659
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so you you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2246-0
00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:51.419
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely work on call lab if
that's that's a easier way for you guys.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2273-0
00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:57.389
<v Hou, Eric>And after that you can save a copy in
GitHub if you guys share a repository on</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2273-1
00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:02.069
<v Hou, Eric>GitHub and then you can definitely save
your copies on GitHub so that you can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2273-2
00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:04.049
<v Hou, Eric>just merge your codes eventually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2283-0
00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:07.809
<v Hou, Eric>I just need 1111 version of your homework.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2286-0
00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:09.329
<v Hou, Eric>I don't need five or four.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2295-0
00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:12.129
<v Hou, Eric>So then you guys decide how to work on it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2300-0
00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:15.209
<v Hou, Eric>You can use π hub. You can use Kolab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2322-0
00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:20.909
<v Hou, Eric>Or or Kaggle Kaggle so offers a virtual
machine either way,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2322-1
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:26.006
<v Hou, Eric>so pretty much all the virtual machines
connect to GitHub that you guys can share</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2322-2
00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:26.379
<v Hou, Eric>codes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2325-0
00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:31.969
<v Hou, Eric>Any question?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2327-0
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.789
<v Hou, Eric>Huh.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2329-0
00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:40.669
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2334-0
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.559
<v Hou, Eric>I don't need a second.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2337-0
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:47.879
<v Hou, Eric>Alright, let's, let's continue.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2338-0
00:19:47.879 --> 00:19:49.519
<v Hou, Eric>Well, we have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2340-0
00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:51.939
<v Hou, Eric>Gone last time.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2342-0
00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:54.859
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2356-0
00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:01.389
<v Hou, Eric>So last time we talked about the
classification model and then we talk</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2356-1
00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:02.649
<v Hou, Eric>about the bankruptcy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2359-0
00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:05.019
<v Hou, Eric>Example right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2399-0
00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:10.334
<v Hou, Eric>So then we said, OK,
so we we talk about unbalanced classes,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2399-1
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:16.520
<v Hou, Eric>say we do have like two classes.
If they are balanced and then you MIS</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2399-2
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.619
<v Hou, Eric>predict either the Class A or Class B or
or plus Class B and Class N.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2409-0
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:25.299
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is really like the error
made in training.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2415-0
00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:27.579
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to do a better job on
that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2417-0
00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:28.769
<v Hou, Eric>However.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2437-0
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:37.283
<v Hou, Eric>If the true population is not balanced
you you you definitely skew one side</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2437-1
00:20:37.283 --> 00:20:38.819
<v Hou, Eric>versus the other.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2458-0
00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:44.767
<v Hou, Eric>So then it is really possible that for
your classification result that you you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2458-1
00:20:44.767 --> 00:20:47.459
<v Hou, Eric>have you have like imperfect results.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2479-0
00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:51.172
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we talk about how to balance
the data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2479-1
00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:56.739
<v Hou, Eric>So then to make your model like helpful
in the end instead of just like basically.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2481-0
00:20:57.699 --> 00:20:57.899
<v Hou, Eric>A default value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2491-0
00:20:58.599 --> 00:21:02.239
<v Hou, Eric>So there are several metrics that you can
gauge the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2502-0
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.179
<v Hou, Eric>The performance of those classification
models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2504-0
00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:09.019
<v Hou, Eric>Oh.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2508-0
00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:13.009
<v Hou, Eric>You you guys can see my screen right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2515-0
00:21:15.689 --> 00:21:19.649
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, yes. OK. So one thing is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2520-0
00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:22.499
<v Hou, Eric>The the confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2530-0
00:21:24.499 --> 00:21:26.899
<v Hou, Eric>I think last time we talked about the
confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2540-0
00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:31.145
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so this is the matrix we have seen last</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2540-1
00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:31.579
<v Hou, Eric>time.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2547-0
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:34.659
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm sorry,
I just make it a lot of.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2554-0
00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:40.099
<v Hou, Eric>Variables, but eventually it will be.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2562-0
00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.019
<v Hou, Eric>It will be easier to to to to understand.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2563-0
00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:42.619
<v Hou, Eric>I'm sorry, I just.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2566-0
00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:43.699
<v Hou, Eric>I shouldn't make that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2577-0
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:54.579
<v Hou, Eric>So so say that we have a confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2579-0
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:56.779
<v Hou, Eric>I'm sorry, that was right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2598-0
00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:07.478
<v Hou, Eric>We have a confusion matrix and this is
the actual values and those are</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2598-1
00:22:07.478 --> 00:22:09.379
<v Hou, Eric>predictions, so actual values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2605-0
00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:12.139
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just pretend we only have two
classes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2614-0
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.219
<v Hou, Eric>Other cool classes is a flag and there's
a yes or no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2627-0
00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:19.724
<v Hou, Eric>So yes,
no could be the company the company went</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2627-1
00:22:19.724 --> 00:22:20.619
<v Hou, Eric>bankruptcy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2631-0
00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:22.539
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, there's one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2638-0
00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:25.339
<v Hou, Eric>No, is a zero, or do we?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2643-0
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:29.459
<v Hou, Eric>Do we approve a loan to a person? Yes,
it's a one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2647-0
00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:30.859
<v Hou, Eric>No, there's a no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2656-0
00:22:31.709 --> 00:22:35.349
<v Hou, Eric>So through the classification model,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2663-0
00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:37.949
<v Hou, Eric>So then you eventually going to have only
four.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2672-0
00:22:39.499 --> 00:22:42.579
<v Hou, Eric>4 outcomes. Basically,
that's a two by two matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2675-0
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:46.189
<v Hou, Eric>The actual value is yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2678-0
00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:48.499
<v Hou, Eric>Your prediction is yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2692-0
00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:53.579
<v Hou, Eric>So that that is what we call the true
positive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2701-0
00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:58.219
<v Hou, Eric>So TEP represents to true positive. OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2711-0
00:22:58.219 --> 00:23:01.659
<v Hou, Eric>So then it was supposed to be, yes.
And you're predicting, yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2729-0
00:23:01.659 --> 00:23:06.148
<v Hou, Eric>So that's true positive. However,
if the actual Y is negative,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2729-1
00:23:06.148 --> 00:23:10.779
<v Hou, Eric>meaning we are not going to prove that
that loan to that person.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2732-0
00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:12.619
<v Hou, Eric>However, your prediction is also.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2736-0
00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:14.389
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2747-0
00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:17.669
<v Hou, Eric>No to to to to the loan to that person.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2751-0
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:19.869
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is a true negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2777-0
00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:24.231
<v Hou, Eric>So it's ATM.
So as you can see for any classification</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2777-1
00:23:24.231 --> 00:23:28.189
<v Hou, Eric>model,
we are trying to maximize this TN and TP.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2787-0
00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:32.909
<v Hou, Eric>Or, or more precisely,
the proportion of this tntp.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2791-0
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:37.749
<v Hou, Eric>Overall,
the reason is there are another two cases.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2801-0
00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:42.899
<v Hou, Eric>Are sort of the wrong cases. For example,
the actual is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2820-0
00:23:45.129 --> 00:23:48.145
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning we are supposed to keep that
person alone,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2820-1
00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:52.049
<v Hou, Eric>or we're supposed that that company is
supposed to go bankruptcy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2829-0
00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:58.649
<v Hou, Eric>However, we are predicting no.
So then this is the false negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2840-0
00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:07.569
<v Hou, Eric>Because we're predicting negative,
but the negative is factually wrong.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2849-0
00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:09.889
<v Hou, Eric>We are supposed to predict in positive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2859-0
00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:12.758
<v Hou, Eric>However,
predict negative to a value that is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2859-1
00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:14.289
<v Hou, Eric>supposed to be positive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2872-0
00:24:14.689 --> 00:24:20.929
<v Hou, Eric>So then we call it a false negative.
In the other hand, the actual value is no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2881-0
00:24:20.929 --> 00:24:26.289
<v Hou, Eric>However, we predicted yes,
so that is the false positive, so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2889-0
00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:30.139
<v Hou, Eric>There is only those four outcomes that
can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2905-0
00:24:30.449 --> 00:24:37.748
<v Hou, Eric>You can have from a classification model
results true negative, true positive,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2905-1
00:24:37.748 --> 00:24:40.889
<v Hou, Eric>false positive and false negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2910-0
00:24:41.049 --> 00:24:43.329
<v Hou, Eric>We are maximizing the proportion of.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2928-0
00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:53.769
<v Hou, Eric>The true negative and true positive so
that we define a number of matrix to to,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2928-1
00:24:53.769 --> 00:24:54.099
<v Hou, Eric>to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2939-0
00:24:55.939 --> 00:24:59.059
<v Hou, Eric>To quantify the performance of the
classification model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2956-0
00:24:59.689 --> 00:25:04.981
<v Hou, Eric>The foundation of all the metrics we
define is based upon this confusion</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2956-1
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:05.489
<v Hou, Eric>matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2977-0
00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:11.757
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why pretty much all data
scientists will print the confusion</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2977-1
00:25:11.757 --> 00:25:15.822
<v Hou, Eric>matrix first.
To understand the performance and then</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2977-2
00:25:15.822 --> 00:25:16.129
<v Hou, Eric>you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2978-0
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:17.849
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly, I do.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2981-0
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:18.769
<v Hou, Eric>Not really.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2996-0
00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:23.819
<v Hou, Eric>Remember, really memorize those rate.
Although it's called a sensitivity</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/2996-1
00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:24.649
<v Hou, Eric>specificity.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3001-0
00:25:24.729 --> 00:25:26.769
<v Hou, Eric>So then you don't have to remember those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3007-0
00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:29.739
<v Hou, Eric>Your confusion matrix is going to be the
key.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3025-0
00:25:30.089 --> 00:25:34.934
<v Hou, Eric>To communicate with your peers or with
your stakeholders with you know about</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3025-1
00:25:34.934 --> 00:25:35.689
<v Hou, Eric>your target.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3054-0
00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:40.636
<v Hou, Eric>So then anyone, everyone,
hopefully after this class can read those</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3054-1
00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:44.548
<v Hou, Eric>confusion matrix.
But you really do not have to remember</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3054-2
00:25:44.548 --> 00:25:49.009
<v Hou, Eric>those metrics. With that being said,
we do define those metrics.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3062-0
00:25:49.289 --> 00:25:52.569
<v Hou, Eric>One thing is called a true positive rate
and TPR.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3066-0
00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:54.009
<v Hou, Eric>What is that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3070-0
00:25:54.329 --> 00:25:56.609
<v Hou, Eric>That is the true positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3077-0
00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:59.219
<v Hou, Eric>Divided by the true positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3081-0
00:25:59.489 --> 00:26:01.489
<v Hou, Eric>And false negative rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3114-0
00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:09.219
<v Hou, Eric>That is a proportion of the actual
positive that are correctly identified by</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3114-1
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:13.059
<v Hou, Eric>the model,
meaning the true positives positives</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3114-2
00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:18.019
<v Hou, Eric>divided by all the examples that are
supposed to be positive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3117-0
00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:19.979
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3119-0
00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:21.899
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a true.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3130-0
00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:28.339
<v Hou, Eric>Positive rate TPR and then we call it the
sensitivity.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3135-0
00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:30.969
<v Hou, Eric>Associate with the true, are you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3144-0
00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:36.009
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is called false positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3166-0
00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:39.895
<v Hou, Eric>By the way,
the true positive rate is one thing that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3166-1
00:26:39.895 --> 00:26:44.009
<v Hou, Eric>we hope we can maximize the false neg and
positive rate is FPR.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3177-0
00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:50.489
<v Hou, Eric>It is the false positive divided by the
false positive plus the true negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3181-0
00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:51.809
<v Hou, Eric>What is that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3187-0
00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:55.009
<v Hou, Eric>That is,
the proportion of the actual negatives.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3230-0
00:26:56.809 --> 00:27:02.813
<v Hou, Eric>That are incorpor classified as positive,
meaning this is something that is wrong</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3230-1
00:27:02.813 --> 00:27:08.597
<v Hou, Eric>and then we hope to minimize and this
value is 1 minus the specificity and the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3230-2
00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:14.747
<v Hou, Eric>specificity is a true negative divided by
false positive plus true negative meaning</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3230-3
00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:17.969
<v Hou, Eric>this part divided by this this entire
role.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3237-0
00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:20.329
<v Hou, Eric>And that's the fun thing that we hope to
maximize as well.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3249-0
00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:25.769
<v Hou, Eric>So sensitivity and specificity are two
numbers we hope to maximize.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3263-0
00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:29.249
<v Hou, Eric>And the false positive is something we
hope to minimize.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3278-0
00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:33.456
<v Hou, Eric>The reason why we even need false
positive is the following side.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3278-1
00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:35.729
<v Hou, Eric>But before I go to the following slide.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3287-0
00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:39.699
<v Hou, Eric>How confusing are those matrix to you
guys right now?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3293-0
00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:50.249
<v Hou, Eric>Is that good or not so great so far?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3297-0
00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:53.149
<v Benbenek, MATT>I think it makes sense.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3299-0
00:27:53.689 --> 00:27:54.209
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3300-0
00:27:54.609 --> 00:27:54.929
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3314-0
00:27:56.499 --> 00:27:59.453
<v Hou, Eric>Does it make sense to everyone?
So based upon this matrix we can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3314-1
00:27:59.453 --> 00:28:00.499
<v Hou, Eric>calculate those values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3329-0
00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:08.669
<v Hou, Eric>So true positive is really the true
positive divide by the number in this row.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3366-0
00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:14.395
<v Hou, Eric>False positive is the false positive
number divided by the number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3366-1
00:28:14.395 --> 00:28:19.151
<v Hou, Eric>The summation of this row and the
specificity is the true negative number</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3366-2
00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:21.529
<v Hou, Eric>divided by the summation of this row.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3369-0
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:23.929
<v Hou, Eric>That's basically how I memorize those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3399-0
00:28:25.499 --> 00:28:30.743
<v Hou, Eric>And sensitivity, specificity,
sensitivity is associated with a positive</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3399-1
00:28:30.743 --> 00:28:36.061
<v Hou, Eric>numbers positive positive results and
specificity associated with a true</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3399-2
00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:37.299
<v Hou, Eric>negative results.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3402-0
00:28:37.939 --> 00:28:39.339
<v Hou, Eric>That's how you memorize it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3408-0
00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:41.419
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you can memorize it in this way.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3415-0
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:43.309
<v Hou, Eric>That's my way to memorize it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3425-0
00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:49.549
<v Hou, Eric>Not necessarily is the best way. OK,
so you have those values defined. OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3430-0
00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:55.369
<v Hou, Eric>This is another example, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3437-0
00:28:56.939 --> 00:28:59.659
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say remember I I I talked to you
guys.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3445-0
00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:03.259
<v Hou, Eric>Let let me show you guys the outcome of
those results right first.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3454-0
00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:16.179
<v Hou, Eric>We we talk about, we gonna run,
we gonna run.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3467-0
00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:21.499
<v Hou, Eric>We we we run logistic regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3478-0
00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:25.299
<v Hou, Eric>But you you guys didn't see what is
outcome of logistic regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3504-0
00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:30.248
<v Hou, Eric>This is the outcome,
so outcome of this logistic regression</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3504-1
00:29:30.248 --> 00:29:37.094
<v Hou, Eric>model is basically a number between zero
and one associated with every single case</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3504-2
00:29:37.094 --> 00:29:38.579
<v Hou, Eric>you're predicting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3511-0
00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:42.619
<v Hou, Eric>So you're predicting if a company a,
whether or not company.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3536-0
00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:46.609
<v Hou, Eric>Hey,
it's is going to go bankruptcy and this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3536-1
00:29:46.609 --> 00:29:52.129
<v Hou, Eric>65.77% is going to be the outcome,
the raw outcome from the logistic</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3536-2
00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:53.009
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3550-0
00:29:53.599 --> 00:29:59.628
<v Hou, Eric>Basically,
the model is saying the company is 55.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3550-1
00:29:59.628 --> 00:30:01.799
<v Hou, Eric>77% Go bankruptcy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3583-0
00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:06.598
<v Hou, Eric>And sometimes you're going to see this
number .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3583-1
00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:11.420
<v Hou, Eric>0021 that basically model saying based
upon the the the training data,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3583-2
00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.543
<v Hou, Eric>the model learn from,
it's only less than 1%,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3583-3
00:30:14.543 --> 00:30:19.229
<v Hou, Eric>your company will go bankruptcy, OK.
And sometimes it's even higher.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3583-4
00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:20.859
<v Hou, Eric>Like let me just change.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3590-0
00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:21.979
<v Hou, Eric>The number, for example 99.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3592-0
00:30:21.979 --> 00:30:23.099
<v Hou, Eric>So we can have 99%.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3615-0
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:29.377
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually, eventually remember,
we start with some 01 values as a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3615-1
00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:33.869
<v Hou, Eric>starting point of this.
Of this logistic regressions, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3632-0
00:30:33.869 --> 00:30:39.429
<v Hou, Eric>We only say one company when bankruptcy
or one company did not go bankruptcy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3657-0
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:45.916
<v Hou, Eric>That's 01 flag and even for loan approval,
you're either give that person a loan or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3657-1
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:48.509
<v Hou, Eric>you're not giving that person a loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3660-0
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:49.949
<v Hou, Eric>Is it only zero and one?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3668-0
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:54.819
<v Hou, Eric>There we have to define a way to convert
those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3670-0
00:30:56.169 --> 00:30:57.289
<v Hou, Eric>Probabilities.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3681-0
00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:00.379
<v Hou, Eric>Into only two values, zero and one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3691-0
00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:05.699
<v Hou, Eric>So then we need to somehow define a
threshold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3720-0
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:11.839
<v Hou, Eric>A threshold is a number if the
probability bigger than that threshold,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3720-1
00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Hou, Eric>I can say it is A1.
If the probability lower than threshold</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3720-2
00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.939
<v Hou, Eric>we hope will give that case A0.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3731-0
00:31:18.939 --> 00:31:24.379
<v Hou, Eric>That's how we define the threshold and
how we divide the 01.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3734-0
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:26.489
<v Hou, Eric>Interval into two values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3748-0
00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:32.659
<v Hou, Eric>And name it and Mark it as zero and one
is how we do it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3751-0
00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:36.619
<v Hou, Eric>So then the threshold is playing a role
here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3772-0
00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:45.151
<v Hou, Eric>And and what is the good or bad the
threshold we should be using as a default</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3772-1
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:47.119
<v Hou, Eric>that threshold is .5 S.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3776-0
00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:48.479
<v Hou, Eric>Then you can see.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3787-0
00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:55.519
<v Hou, Eric>Some you can you see the final result
from your you know confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3791-0
00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.839
<v Hou, Eric>It will look like this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3798-0
00:31:57.239 --> 00:31:58.999
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just making up those numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3802-0
00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:00.839
<v Hou, Eric>Demonstrate what I mean.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3804-0
00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.679
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm using threshold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3812-0
00:32:03.459 --> 00:32:05.379
<v Hou, Eric>The entire testing data will look like
this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3816-0
00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:08.179
<v Hou, Eric>I have this number of true negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3830-0
00:32:08.729 --> 00:32:13.459
<v Hou, Eric>I have this number of true positive and I
have this number as a false positive and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3830-1
00:32:13.459 --> 00:32:15.169
<v Hou, Eric>this number of false negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3837-0
00:32:16.739 --> 00:32:19.219
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon a threshold equals to 0.5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3866-0
00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:27.708
<v Hou, Eric>And since I have a threshold .5,
I can calculate the true positive rate</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3866-1
00:32:27.708 --> 00:32:33.099
<v Hou, Eric>which is this 1015 divided by the
summation of this row.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3879-0
00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:40.619
<v Hou, Eric>So that give me 157 five and I can
calculate my false positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3892-0
00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:43.678
<v Hou, Eric>That is,
this number divided by the summation of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3892-1
00:32:43.678 --> 00:32:44.169
<v Hou, Eric>this row.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3901-0
00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:51.479
<v Hou, Eric>That's only .05 this number .57 five,
and this number .0534.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3916-0
00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:59.089
<v Hou, Eric>Is they both based upon assumption that
my threshold should be .5?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3923-0
00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:01.409
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have this confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3946-0
00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:07.979
<v Hou, Eric>I calculate this but it does not mean my
threshold has to be .5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3946-1
00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:15.369
<v Hou, Eric>If I change the threshold a little bit,
I change the threshold to be .69.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3952-0
00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:18.779
<v Hou, Eric>My confusion matrix changed.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3976-0
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:23.702
<v Hou, Eric>To this one and under this threshold the
number,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3976-1
00:33:23.702 --> 00:33:28.328
<v Hou, Eric>although the summation of those four
numbers still remain the same,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/3976-2
00:33:28.328 --> 00:33:30.369
<v Hou, Eric>but they gonna be reallocated.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4003-0
00:33:30.849 --> 00:33:37.025
<v Hou, Eric>So then my TPR based upon this threshold
is only .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4003-1
00:33:37.025 --> 00:33:44.049
<v Hou, Eric>2910 and my false rate false positive
rate is only .0174.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4006-0
00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:46.049
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4022-0
00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:51.786
<v Hou, Eric>My true positive rate declined
significantly under the new threshold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4022-1
00:33:51.786 --> 00:33:54.119
<v Hou, Eric>This is really a bad news for me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4033-0
00:33:55.689 --> 00:33:58.357
<v Hou, Eric>However,
my false positive rate also declined</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4033-1
00:33:58.357 --> 00:33:59.169
<v Hou, Eric>significantly.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4037-0
00:33:59.289 --> 00:34:00.769
<v Hou, Eric>That's actually good news.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4044-0
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:04.889
<v Hou, Eric>So eventually you need to balance what
the threshold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4063-0
00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:12.696
<v Hou, Eric>You want to use because you need to know
whether this is a false positive rate,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4063-1
00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:17.369
<v Hou, Eric>mean more to you or the true positive
rate mean more to you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4069-0
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.909
<v Hou, Eric>Let me give you one the actual example.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4081-0
00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:29.129
<v Hou, Eric>The actual example is you want to use the
model to identify.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4092-0
00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:34.569
<v Hou, Eric>Who is the top where you customers?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4095-0
00:34:35.049 --> 00:34:37.049
<v Hou, Eric>So say you're running a website, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4130-0
00:34:37.049 --> 00:34:39.840
<v Hou, Eric>So then you collect their their
transaction data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4130-1
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.854
<v Hou, Eric>Some people purchase more,
some people purchase less,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4130-2
00:34:42.854 --> 00:34:47.375
<v Hou, Eric>but based upon who they are you you may
collect some you know phmo graphic data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4130-3
00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:49.329
<v Hou, Eric>You may collect a demographic data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4159-0
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.917
<v Hou, Eric>Who they are, how old they are,
where they live, you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4159-1
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:56.648
<v Hou, Eric>hopefully you can. You can.
You can buy some data like their income</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4159-2
00:34:56.648 --> 00:35:01.039
<v Hou, Eric>and then and then also you do have the
data. Now what they purchase on day one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4172-0
00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:07.679
<v Hou, Eric>As for the business, the customer,
the customers have a different value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4187-0
00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:11.437
<v Hou, Eric>Social wisdom.
Some customer may purchase $1000 from</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4187-1
00:35:11.437 --> 00:35:12.359
<v Hou, Eric>your website.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4195-0
00:35:12.359 --> 00:35:15.479
<v Hou, Eric>Some customer only purchase $10 from your
website.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4222-0
00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:20.761
<v Hou, Eric>The difference is your effort serving
those customers from a marketing</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4222-1
00:35:20.761 --> 00:35:25.054
<v Hou, Eric>perspective will be totally different for
high value customers,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4222-2
00:35:25.054 --> 00:35:26.999
<v Hou, Eric>you want to send them emails.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4237-0
00:35:27.809 --> 00:35:31.527
<v Hou, Eric>You want to send them reminders.
You want to give them some discount so</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4237-1
00:35:31.527 --> 00:35:33.489
<v Hou, Eric>that they can come back purchase more.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4273-0
00:35:33.879 --> 00:35:40.017
<v Hou, Eric>Because even though you give them a 20%
discount and and their lifetime value is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4273-1
00:35:40.017 --> 00:35:43.730
<v Hou, Eric>out $1000,
still earn $800 out of it for for $10</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4273-2
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.519
<v Hou, Eric>worth customer.
You wouldn't want to do anything.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4281-0
00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:52.599
<v Hou, Eric>That's how you actually differentiate
those customers. And in that case.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4298-0
00:35:54.689 --> 00:35:58.236
<v Hou, Eric>The If you want to maximize this true
positive rate,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4298-1
00:35:58.236 --> 00:36:01.649
<v Hou, Eric>meaning identify who are the high value
customers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4304-0
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:04.969
<v Hou, Eric>The reason behind seeing is you're seeing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4323-0
00:36:05.319 --> 00:36:09.351
<v Hou, Eric>This true positive rate that is
associated with your margin that is</v>

00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:13.799
<v Hou, Eric>associated with your profit or revenue,
so that you want to maximize this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4334-0
00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.624
<v Hou, Eric>In the same time,
you wouldn't want to see your false</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4334-1
00:36:17.624 --> 00:36:18.209
<v Hou, Eric>positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4354-0
00:36:18.329 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Hou, Eric>You know super high,
but you this is something that you want</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4354-1
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.769
<v Hou, Eric>to prioritize because you do have a
different way of social anthem.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4379-0
00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:31.378
<v Hou, Eric>Another side,
you're seeing your marketing is just</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4379-1
00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:36.057
<v Hou, Eric>basically a channel that attract your
customers coming back to purchase and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4379-2
00:36:36.057 --> 00:36:38.519
<v Hou, Eric>this is another revenue driven business.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4404-0
00:36:38.519 --> 00:36:41.867
<v Hou, Eric>This is really a cost driven business.
If that's the case,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4404-1
00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:46.067
<v Hou, Eric>the way to associate with your true
positive rate and your false positive</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4404-2
00:36:46.067 --> 00:36:47.599
<v Hou, Eric>rate are totally different.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4421-0
00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:51.963
<v Hou, Eric>You may want to focus on this false
positive rate over the true positive rate</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4421-1
00:36:51.963 --> 00:36:54.319
<v Hou, Eric>just because they may have a different
cost.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4423-0
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:55.369
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4430-0
00:36:57.089 --> 00:36:58.609
<v Hou, Eric>What number you want to optimize?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4435-0
00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:01.039
<v Hou, Eric>It totally depend on your business model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4438-0
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:03.209
<v Hou, Eric>That's point I wanna make.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4454-0
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:10.039
<v Hou, Eric>But you can play around with different
threshold. You can have,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4454-1
00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.809
<v Hou, Eric>you can even manually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4468-0
00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:16.421
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
tweak this true positive rate and false</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4468-1
00:37:16.421 --> 00:37:18.529
<v Hou, Eric>positive rate to different numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4479-0
00:37:18.889 --> 00:37:23.689
<v Hou, Eric>I just want to show you that yes,
we have a default value .5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4487-0
00:37:23.689 --> 00:37:26.558
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
usually people consider those are gold</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4487-1
00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:27.729
<v Hou, Eric>the golden standard.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4490-0
00:37:27.729 --> 00:37:29.609
<v Hou, Eric>But there's so many numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4523-0
00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:34.439
<v Hou, Eric>Any parameters you can tweak to achieve
the numbers you want,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4523-1
00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:39.953
<v Hou, Eric>but you need to understand what is a
business model behind the scene and you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4523-2
00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:44.679
<v Hou, Eric>want to maximize what another metrics to
fit your business model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4549-0
00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:50.105
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the one thing I usually remind
my direct reports, you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4549-1
00:37:50.105 --> 00:37:53.443
<v Hou, Eric>in this class,
we can always consider you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4549-2
00:37:53.443 --> 00:37:56.919
<v Hou, Eric>we have some really fancy data,
really cool data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4556-0
00:37:56.919 --> 00:37:59.959
<v Hou, Eric>We can build a model based upon it and
play some games and then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4575-0
00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:04.527
<v Hou, Eric>Show people some fancy models,
but in real life you're dealing with</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4575-1
00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:07.639
<v Hou, Eric>business problems and business problem is
more.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4590-0
00:38:09.249 --> 00:38:13.101
<v Hou, Eric>Sophisticated,
complicated than a a A number machine</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4590-1
00:38:13.101 --> 00:38:14.409
<v Hou, Eric>learning fun game.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4593-0
00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:16.689
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to figure out.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4597-0
00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:19.569
<v Hou, Eric>Revenue cost.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4605-0
00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:21.649
<v Hou, Eric>What other metrics behind the scene?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4619-0
00:38:21.729 --> 00:38:27.453
<v Hou, Eric>Because those are going to be working as
the weights associated with your your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4619-1
00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:29.409
<v Hou, Eric>class, your classification.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4637-0
00:38:29.919 --> 00:38:36.171
<v Hou, Eric>Metrics and you need to optimize your
model based upon the weight behind the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4637-1
00:38:36.171 --> 00:38:38.039
<v Hou, Eric>scene, not necessarily.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4645-0
00:38:38.039 --> 00:38:42.239
<v Hou, Eric>You have to go to this threshold .
5 does it make sense?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4649-0
00:38:49.559 --> 00:38:50.079
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4654-0
00:38:50.319 --> 00:38:51.359
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully he does.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4671-0
00:38:52.359 --> 00:38:58.199
<v Hou, Eric>So we do have we play around with dear
friends threshold. We have those numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4694-0
00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:02.507
<v Hou, Eric>What we can sketch is this chart is this
called Roc,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4694-1
00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:07.113
<v Hou, Eric>the receiver operating character
characteristics curve Roc.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4694-2
00:39:07.113 --> 00:39:08.879
<v Hou, Eric>What is Roc telling us?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4707-0
00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:13.199
<v Hou, Eric>The the X axis is your false positive
rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4712-0
00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:16.959
<v Hou, Eric>The Y axis is the true positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4714-0
00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:18.129
<v Hou, Eric>We are.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4719-0
00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.889
<v Hou, Eric>We are really changing the dear friend.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4729-0
00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:23.359
<v Hou, Eric>Threshold you have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4735-0
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.999
<v Hou, Eric>The threshold equals Infinity.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4739-0
00:39:24.999 --> 00:39:27.159
<v Hou, Eric>You have threshold equals 76.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4748-0
00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:30.039
<v Hou, Eric>You have threshold equals 6069.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4756-0
00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:33.119
<v Hou, Eric>You have a threshold equals 0 for values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4767-0
00:39:33.399 --> 00:39:37.239
<v Hou, Eric>You have a different true positive rate
and false positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4779-0
00:39:37.439 --> 00:39:44.839
<v Hou, Eric>That's how you can sketch that curve on
this 01 multiply 01 plane on this box.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4792-0
00:39:46.369 --> 00:39:51.089
<v Hou, Eric>The area under this curve is called
literally area under the curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4808-0
00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:56.199
<v Hou, Eric>With AUC and AUC is a number between zero
and one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4832-0
00:39:56.199 --> 00:40:02.713
<v Hou, Eric>So this number is quantified whether or
not the classification model you build is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4832-1
00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:07.559
<v Hou, Eric>it better than a pure gas,
meaning everything is half a tab.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4835-0
00:40:07.559 --> 00:40:08.919
<v Hou, Eric>I have no information.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4838-0
00:40:08.919 --> 00:40:10.079
<v Hou, Eric>I just guess it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4848-0
00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:13.599
<v Hou, Eric>I cannot tell what's the what's the case
one versus case B.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4854-0
00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.399
<v Hou, Eric>What is positive versus negative?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4861-0
00:40:15.399 --> 00:40:18.439
<v Hou, Eric>I cannot tell any difference,
so that's a pure gas.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4865-0
00:40:19.289 --> 00:40:20.049
<v Hou, Eric>For a pure gas.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4876-0
00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:26.239
<v Hou, Eric>You have five of AUC if for any model you
have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4897-0
00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:34.659
<v Hou, Eric>The area under this Roc bigger than .5,
you're sort of quantifying that your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4897-1
00:40:34.659 --> 00:40:38.929
<v Hou, Eric>model is definitely better than a pure
gas, OK?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4923-0
00:40:40.529 --> 00:40:44.218
<v Hou, Eric>So this number you can tell people that
it's definitely better model than a pure</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4923-1
00:40:44.218 --> 00:40:46.222
<v Hou, Eric>gas,
because people gonna argue with what's</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4923-2
00:40:46.222 --> 00:40:49.729
<v Hou, Eric>the difference between neural model and
the pure gas. You you can tell that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4949-0
00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:55.286
<v Hou, Eric>And this is the way how you quantify it
and and and this way it's going to tell</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4949-1
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:59.910
<v Hou, Eric>people like how much your model is better
than the pure gas and those of you can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4949-2
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.279
<v Hou, Eric>sort of compare your model versus another
competing model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4962-0
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:08.409
<v Hou, Eric>Using AUC to see which model is better,
you can definitely do that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4969-0
00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:10.809
<v Hou, Eric>It's a way to prove this value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4973-0
00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:12.209
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely bring some value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4980-0
00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:16.609
<v Hou, Eric>It's a way to compare models one model
against another.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/4983-0
00:41:17.129 --> 00:41:19.169
<v Hou, Eric>Again, this is a based upon.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5028-0
00:41:19.939 --> 00:41:22.855
<v Hou, Eric>That you know the numbers behind the
scene,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5028-1
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:27.560
<v Hou, Eric>there is no way to associate with it.
If you want to maximize revenue.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5028-2
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.934
<v Hou, Eric>If you want to reduce cars,
you want to maximize or minimize some</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5028-3
00:41:31.934 --> 00:41:37.369
<v Hou, Eric>numbers in your business model and then
this Roc and AOC number could be changed.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5030-0
00:41:38.379 --> 00:41:38.619
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5042-0
00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:45.026
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
there are some extreme cases of this Roc</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5042-1
00:41:45.026 --> 00:41:45.599
<v Hou, Eric>though.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5057-0
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:51.343
<v Hou, Eric>What are those, the AUC equal to one?
What is AUC equal to 1?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5057-1
00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:54.679
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning I am fulfilling this entire?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5085-0
00:41:56.689 --> 00:42:01.432
<v Hou, Eric>Plane. What does that mean?
If your AOC AUC equal to one,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5085-1
00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:07.564
<v Hou, Eric>that means your you have a direct
horizontal line here where atpr the true</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5085-2
00:42:07.564 --> 00:42:09.609
<v Hou, Eric>positive rate equal to 1.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5112-0
00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:16.378
<v Hou, Eric>If your true positive rate equal to one,
you know the formula that is the true</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5112-1
00:42:16.378 --> 00:42:21.239
<v Hou, Eric>positive rate divided by summation of
this row not equals to one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5141-0
00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.496
<v Hou, Eric>That means your false negative equals
zero,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5141-1
00:42:24.496 --> 00:42:27.753
<v Hou, Eric>and if your false positive rate equal to
0,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5141-2
00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:33.896
<v Hou, Eric>meaning for all the lines here your false
your your false positive rate equal to 0</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5141-3
00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:35.599
<v Hou, Eric>so then you can say OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5155-0
00:42:36.409 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Hou, Eric>Your false positive equals 0,
so then this will be the basket scenario</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5155-1
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.129
<v Hou, Eric>fully understand.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5163-0
00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:45.039
<v Hou, Eric>You'll fully understand the data,
the cases they were dealing with.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5165-0
00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:48.319
<v Hou, Eric>We's not being sad.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5175-0
00:42:49.779 --> 00:42:53.622
<v Hou, Eric>If you have a perfect score,
a perfect AUC is that a good thing or a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5175-1
00:42:53.622 --> 00:42:54.179
<v Hou, Eric>bad thing?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5178-0
00:42:56.989 --> 00:42:58.189
<v Hou, Eric>In reality.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5208-0
00:42:58.189 --> 00:43:02.517
<v Hou, Eric>In reality that your your data scientist
or data analyst,</v>

00:43:02.517 --> 00:43:08.488
<v Hou, Eric>your data person come to you and say hey
manager I I I run the model and then I</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5208-2
00:43:08.488 --> 00:43:09.309
<v Hou, Eric>know fully.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5252-0
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:14.747
<v Hou, Eric>Everything you know from you know how you
build your portfolio,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5252-1
00:43:14.747 --> 00:43:19.642
<v Hou, Eric>how you build anything and then and then
you ask you ask him or her what's your,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5252-2
00:43:19.642 --> 00:43:23.087
<v Hou, Eric>what's your AUC and that person said he
or she said, OK,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5252-3
00:43:23.087 --> 00:43:24.719
<v Hou, Eric>the AUC of my model is one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5261-0
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:28.629
<v Hou, Eric>Should you feel happy about it,
or should you feel unhappy about it?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5265-0
00:43:34.249 --> 00:43:35.449
<v Benbenek, MATT>I probably wouldn't believe them.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5268-0
00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:37.899
<v Hou, Eric>It's too good to be true, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5270-0
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.549
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5274-0
00:43:40.279 --> 00:43:41.879
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, so usually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5280-0
00:43:43.479 --> 00:43:44.879
<v Hou, Eric>That means you're right, Matt.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5288-0
00:43:44.879 --> 00:43:47.239
<v Hou, Eric>Your your intuition is 100% right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5297-0
00:43:47.239 --> 00:43:49.959
<v Hou, Eric>And then if you receive someone report to
you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5322-0
00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:55.206
<v Hou, Eric>That my AUC is one.
It's too good to be true and actually</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5322-1
00:43:55.206 --> 00:44:01.119
<v Hou, Eric>actually if someone report to you. OK,
you know what my AUC is bigger than .95.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5331-0
00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:06.319
<v Hou, Eric>I have more than 95% of chance that
identify perfectly.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5349-0
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:11.610
<v Hou, Eric>Like one versus the 0 positive versus
negative case one versus case B,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5349-1
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.069
<v Hou, Eric>case one versus case 2.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5359-0
00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:19.999
<v Hou, Eric>You need to go through the model with
your data person.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5364-0
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:24.159
<v Hou, Eric>Line by line of his code or her code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5373-0
00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:28.999
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's definitely too true,
too good to be true.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5381-0
00:44:30.949 --> 00:44:31.989
<v Hou, Eric>There's one thing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5399-0
00:44:32.029 --> 00:44:37.909
<v Hou, Eric>There's one concept called knowledge
leakage that means he or she may use the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5399-1
00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:41.829
<v Hou, Eric>data in a model that he or she should not
be using.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5411-0
00:44:43.569 --> 00:44:46.417
<v Hou, Eric>What those are and what what are those
knowledge?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5411-1
00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:48.809
<v Hou, Eric>Those knowledge could be some future data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5423-0
00:44:50.359 --> 00:44:55.239
<v Hou, Eric>Those knowledge could be some data that
directly related to the final decision.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5425-0
00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:57.509
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5443-0
00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:03.889
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
like I'm predicting future future revenue,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5443-1
00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:07.519
<v Hou, Eric>someone uses the future unit sales
instead of I.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5447-0
00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:09.679
<v Hou, Eric>I'm predicting the number of dollars.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5451-0
00:45:11.399 --> 00:45:12.679
<v Hou, Eric>The company will earn tomorrow.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5473-0
00:45:14.399 --> 00:45:21.161
<v Hou, Eric>And and one common mistake is someone use
how many in terms of how many box of the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5473-1
00:45:21.161 --> 00:45:23.279
<v Hou, Eric>product you sold how many.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5477-0
00:45:24.879 --> 00:45:26.079
<v Hou, Eric>Unit of product you sold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5501-0
00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:31.136
<v Hou, Eric>As a as a as a as a leading indicator in
in his or her model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5501-1
00:45:31.136 --> 00:45:34.629
<v Hou, Eric>and usually that model will be very
accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5507-0
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:37.389
<v Hou, Eric>But that's something he or she should not
be using.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5534-0
00:45:37.389 --> 00:45:43.203
<v Hou, Eric>Because if I know how many units of
product I I will sell tomorrow,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5534-1
00:45:43.203 --> 00:45:49.189
<v Hou, Eric>I can just simply multiply my price and I
have 100% accurate revenue.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5538-0
00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:52.149
<v Hou, Eric>So you do not have to do any prediction.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5548-0
00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:56.359
<v Hou, Eric>And before you have a crystal ball,
you wouldn't know how many.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5553-0
00:45:56.909 --> 00:45:57.949
<v Hou, Eric>You know unit of a.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5560-0
00:45:57.949 --> 00:45:59.909
<v Hou, Eric>Probably you will be selling tomorrow.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5591-0
00:45:59.909 --> 00:46:03.798
<v Hou, Eric>You send me so tomorrow.
So then there's no way. No way.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5591-1
00:46:03.798 --> 00:46:08.710
<v Hou, Eric>You you can use that feature.
You can use that information in a in in a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5591-2
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:13.349
<v Hou, Eric>revenue prediction problem.
And that is a knowledge leakage, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5597-0
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:17.549
<v Hou, Eric>That's a knowledge leakage and and if you
know.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5609-0
00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:24.119
<v Hou, Eric>If you know for example, you,
you you someone is using like the future.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5620-0
00:46:25.719 --> 00:46:30.639
<v Hou, Eric>The future profit as a as a future to
predicting whether or not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5632-0
00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:35.479
<v Hou, Eric>Not a stock should be including your
portfolio.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5633-0
00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:37.239
<v Hou, Eric>This is something.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5675-0
00:46:37.239 --> 00:46:41.472
<v Hou, Eric>This is also the knowledge leakage that
you should argue.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5675-1
00:46:41.472 --> 00:46:47.531
<v Hou, Eric>You should talk to the person whether or
not that profit that stock price is based</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5675-2
00:46:47.531 --> 00:46:53.151
<v Hou, Eric>upon his prediction or his basically
bringing some future future information</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5675-3
00:46:53.151 --> 00:46:57.239
<v Hou, Eric>here as here today which you you should
not be knowing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5681-0
00:46:58.039 --> 00:47:00.079
<v Hou, Eric>You should not know, so you should.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5693-0
00:47:01.149 --> 00:47:06.549
<v Hou, Eric>A wide any knowledge leakage in the inner
model, so be careful.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5726-0
00:47:06.709 --> 00:47:12.805
<v Hou, Eric>This is an extreme case not equal to one,
and this is too good and usually in my</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5726-1
00:47:12.805 --> 00:47:18.074
<v Hou, Eric>career it has never happened that you
have you have AUC bigger than .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5726-2
00:47:18.074 --> 00:47:24.170
<v Hou, Eric>95 unless the data is so perfect like
someone just manually create a data, sure,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5726-3
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.149
<v Hou, Eric>otherwise in.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5737-0
00:47:25.149 --> 00:47:29.549
<v Hou, Eric>Real life examples you you wouldn't have
that that you wouldn't have that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5744-0
00:47:31.029 --> 00:47:34.549
<v Hou, Eric>That that high high accuracy,
you wouldn't have it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5754-0
00:47:34.789 --> 00:47:38.064
<v Hou, Eric>And then by sometimes you wouldn't have
the AUC equal to 0 either,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5754-1
00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:39.189
<v Hou, Eric>meaning that the model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5761-0
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:41.469
<v Hou, Eric>100% cannot figure it out.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5767-0
00:47:41.469 --> 00:47:44.349
<v Hou, Eric>The difference between those two cases,
you wouldn't have that either.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5772-0
00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:46.429
<v Hou, Eric>So AUC equal to .5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5775-0
00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:47.269
<v Hou, Eric>What does that mean?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5777-0
00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:48.229
<v Hou, Eric>This is sort of like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5807-0
00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:53.384
<v Hou, Eric>There is a distribution of the of the
true cases.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5807-1
00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Hou, Eric>There is distribution of false cases and
then you move the bars threshold from</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5807-2
00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.319
<v Hou, Eric>left to hand.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5812-0
00:47:59.319 --> 00:48:01.679
<v Hou, Eric>Right hand. They have the same proportion.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5820-0
00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:03.759
<v Hou, Eric>So you really cannot tell which is which.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5828-0
00:48:03.959 --> 00:48:06.999
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's you have AUC equals .5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5830-0
00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:08.599
<v Hou, Eric>You can just flip a point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5838-0
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.909
<v Hou, Eric>Flip a coin.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5839-0
00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:10.629
<v Hou, Eric>So that's you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5843-0
00:48:10.629 --> 00:48:12.989
<v Hou, Eric>You you have this 1/5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5852-0
00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:16.719
<v Hou, Eric>South .5 is sort of like you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5863-0
00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:22.301
<v Hou, Eric>You you cannot tell where you can just
simply consider this simply coin tossing</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5863-1
00:48:22.301 --> 00:48:22.999
<v Hou, Eric>your toss.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5866-0
00:48:22.999 --> 00:48:23.719
<v Hou, Eric>Toss a coin.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5867-0
00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:25.599
<v Hou, Eric>There's, there's no difference.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5879-0
00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:30.039
<v Hou, Eric>And you have to show your model bigger
than that and then bigger than you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5888-0
00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:35.279
<v Hou, Eric>See equals 2.5.
That makes your model sort of useful.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5923-0
00:48:40.379 --> 00:48:43.491
<v Hou, Eric>I see. So.
So those are the metrics that you can you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5923-1
00:48:43.491 --> 00:48:47.249
<v Hou, Eric>can gauge the performance of a
classification model and the app</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5923-2
00:48:47.249 --> 00:48:51.829
<v Hou, Eric>applications of a classification models.
And you definitely can do the credit</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5923-3
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:52.299
<v Hou, Eric>scoring.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5926-0
00:48:52.299 --> 00:48:54.339
<v Hou, Eric>So then the credit scoring could be.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5932-0
00:48:56.749 --> 00:48:58.309
<v Hou, Eric>A more typical problem, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5947-0
00:48:58.309 --> 00:49:01.662
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
because we are talking about only binary</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5947-1
00:49:01.662 --> 00:49:05.149
<v Hou, Eric>outcomes zero and one,
but credit scoring could be.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5969-0
00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:09.345
<v Hou, Eric>A non binary so you can have ABCD and
Triple H,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5969-1
00:49:09.345 --> 00:49:14.259
<v Hou, Eric>triple B and those kind of cases.
So it will be more difficult.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5984-0
00:49:14.899 --> 00:49:18.515
<v Hou, Eric>But there you know from idea, perspective,
concept, perspective,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5984-1
00:49:18.515 --> 00:49:22.299
<v Hou, Eric>they are just running other
classification model behind the scenes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/5996-0
00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:26.719
<v Hou, Eric>You can also do the flawed detection,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6010-0
00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:31.110
<v Hou, Eric>So there are so many cases that you you
use the data you can,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6010-1
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:34.439
<v Hou, Eric>you know your credit card company, your,
your.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6017-0
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:37.669
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
chase or different companies you spend.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6032-0
00:49:39.879 --> 00:49:42.256
<v Hou, Eric>A big amount of money on something and
they gonna call you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6032-1
00:49:42.256 --> 00:49:44.119
<v Hou, Eric>They gonna send you a message and saying
that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6063-0
00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:49.341
<v Hou, Eric>Really,
you spend the money or or do you think</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6063-1
00:49:49.341 --> 00:49:55.144
<v Hou, Eric>this is really a fraud and someone you
know or threat that someone took your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6063-2
00:49:55.144 --> 00:49:59.290
<v Hou, Eric>credit card?
So then spend the money like without your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6063-3
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.119
<v Hou, Eric>permission.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6071-0
00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:04.279
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can imagine,
they must have used.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6075-0
00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:06.469
<v Hou, Eric>Your historical.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6110-0
00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:13.629
<v Hou, Eric>Transaction patterns to build a model
associated with your pattern associated</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6110-1
00:50:13.629 --> 00:50:16.822
<v Hou, Eric>with you,
and then if there's any amount really</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6110-2
00:50:16.822 --> 00:50:20.216
<v Hou, Eric>higher or lower,
usually higher then that pattern,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6110-3
00:50:20.216 --> 00:50:22.079
<v Hou, Eric>so then you can contact you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6112-0
00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.399
<v Hou, Eric>They're confirming that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6132-0
00:50:25.199 --> 00:50:30.153
<v Hou, Eric>It's really an anomaly where anomaly in
classification model is they're</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6132-1
00:50:30.153 --> 00:50:35.039
<v Hou, Eric>predicting 1, meaning you know it's.
It definitely looks like a fraud.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6154-0
00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:40.683
<v Hou, Eric>And also you know this is how Google is
identifying the scams.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6154-1
00:50:40.683 --> 00:50:45.377
<v Hou, Eric>The way how you tell Google, OK,
this is scam. This is not a scam.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6154-2
00:50:45.377 --> 00:50:47.549
<v Hou, Eric>This is scam. This is not scam.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6161-0
00:50:47.749 --> 00:50:49.109
<v Hou, Eric>So you're always doing that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6172-0
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:53.109
<v Hou, Eric>The Google always asks you the question
that OK, do you think this is scam?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6178-0
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:55.029
<v Hou, Eric>This e-mail is a scam or not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6192-0
00:50:55.429 --> 00:51:01.308
<v Hou, Eric>So the reason why Google is asking you
those questions #1 the the the click yes</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6192-1
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:01.749
<v Hou, Eric>or no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6199-0
00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.799
<v Hou, Eric>You're providing the data to Google.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6201-0
00:51:04.799 --> 00:51:05.999
<v Hou, Eric>You're labeling.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6211-0
00:51:06.709 --> 00:51:08.589
<v Hou, Eric>Those emails for Google?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6216-0
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:12.349
<v Hou, Eric>You're telling Google, OK,
this to me is not a scam.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6227-0
00:51:14.209 --> 00:51:17.929
<v Hou, Eric>The reason Google is asking you is for
those emails.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6234-0
00:51:17.929 --> 00:51:20.329
<v Hou, Eric>They're really in around the boundary.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6236-0
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:22.489
<v Hou, Eric>They for example like this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6255-0
00:51:24.799 --> 00:51:29.035
<v Hou, Eric>Those emails are around this threshold .
5 let me just use .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6255-1
00:51:29.035 --> 00:51:31.119
<v Hou, Eric>5 as example for those emails.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6262-0
00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:34.559
<v Hou, Eric>It could be treated like points 51 or .49.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6275-0
00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:39.279
<v Hou, Eric>Google is also pondering that if this is
scam.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6285-0
00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:44.079
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why Google does not want to
delete or automatically throw that e-mail.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6312-0
00:51:44.389 --> 00:51:49.598
<v Hou, Eric>How to the trash folder that he asks you
so then you provide more data and Google</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6312-1
00:51:49.598 --> 00:51:54.109
<v Hou, Eric>is actually using your labels of those
emails to retrain their models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6320-0
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:56.069
<v Hou, Eric>So next time it will be more and more
accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6331-0
00:51:57.109 --> 00:52:00.595
<v Hou, Eric>That's how Google runs and how Google is
using your clicks,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6331-1
00:52:00.595 --> 00:52:01.989
<v Hou, Eric>clicks to retrain those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6346-0
00:52:01.989 --> 00:52:04.327
<v Hou, Eric>Model.
That's why the Google models and scan</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6346-1
00:52:04.327 --> 00:52:06.509
<v Hou, Eric>models are getting more and more accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6349-0
00:52:07.189 --> 00:52:08.909
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
you're you're providing data to Google.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6367-0
00:52:09.719 --> 00:52:13.018
<v Hou, Eric>Your high of helping Google to label
those emails and then and then Google can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6367-1
00:52:13.018 --> 00:52:15.399
<v Hou, Eric>definitely run a classification model
behind the scenes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6380-0
00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:21.979
<v Hou, Eric>So another one is I mentioned this loan
approval process, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6395-0
00:52:21.979 --> 00:52:26.916
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is something that we can
definitely try and the data is here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6395-1
00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:30.339
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely try this data.
It's pretty cool.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6399-0
00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:36.919
<v Hou, Eric>Hyperlink open hyperlink.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6401-0
00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:41.909
<v Hou, Eric>Oh gosh.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6406-0
00:52:45.189 --> 00:52:46.909
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I can show you the data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6416-0
00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:52.399
<v Hou, Eric>So the data is actually from Kaggle.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6424-0
00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:55.109
<v Hou, Eric>So then, by the way, Haroon, this is the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6429-0
00:52:55.189 --> 00:52:57.469
<v Hou, Eric>This is the way how you bring a cargo
data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6437-0
00:52:57.469 --> 00:53:01.589
<v Hou, Eric>So then you just import a cargo hub and
then you can actually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6449-0
00:53:03.159 --> 00:53:06.239
<v Hou, Eric>Fashion data from cargo to your instance.
I did that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6463-0
00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:12.159
<v Hou, Eric>I just found everything on on GitHub,
right, so then you bring the data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6476-0
00:53:12.159 --> 00:53:18.215
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the data.
So in the data we do have the person age</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6476-1
00:53:18.215 --> 00:53:20.559
<v Hou, Eric>person gender Alli I do.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6480-0
00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:22.599
<v Hou, Eric>I think I have a slide for this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6522-0
00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:30.678
<v Hou, Eric>And the data we have those information

<v Hou, Eric>whether or not that person owns a home.
Is it rent or is it own words 100% owned</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6522-3
00:53:42.735 --> 00:53:47.159
<v Hou, Eric>or the home is on mortgage and and how
much money?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6533-0
00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:51.739
<v Hou, Eric>That person is trying to charge a loan
from the bank or or from you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6538-0
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:53.759
<v Hou, Eric>And what's the purpose of the loan?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6541-0
00:53:54.149 --> 00:53:54.629
<v Hou, Eric>It is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6552-0
00:53:55.389 --> 00:54:01.029
<v Hou, Eric>You are using the money to buy a car or
buy another house or sell. And what is?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6574-0
00:54:02.599 --> 00:54:08.019
<v Hou, Eric>Your grade interest rate, right,
because here in the US that you may not,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6574-1
00:54:08.019 --> 00:54:13.439
<v Hou, Eric>you have to agree on an interest rate
then not necessarily following the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6586-0
00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.799
<v Hou, Eric>The market rate, whatever rate you, you,
you guys agree on?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6590-0
00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:19.319
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's part of it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6597-0
00:54:19.719 --> 00:54:24.199
<v Hou, Eric>And how much of that loan as a percentage
of your annual income?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6612-0
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:27.841
<v Hou, Eric>Right,
so you have this income and this is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6612-1
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:30.029
<v Hou, Eric>really the amount divide by the income?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6630-0
00:54:31.819 --> 00:54:36.162
<v Hou, Eric>And like in years,
how long is that person's credit history</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6630-1
00:54:36.162 --> 00:54:39.419
<v Hou, Eric>and that credit credit score of that
person?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6660-0
00:54:40.269 --> 00:54:45.713
<v Hou, Eric>And and whether or not that person has a
default on different loans.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6660-1
00:54:45.713 --> 00:54:51.393
<v Hou, Eric>And here is the final status.
One is you're you're going to approve not</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6660-2
00:54:51.393 --> 00:54:54.549

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6690-0
00:54:56.309 --> 00:55:01.031
<v Hou, Eric>OK, just seeing this on this data. What?
What information do you guys think will</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6690-1
00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:05.170
<v Hou, Eric>be will be really important in predicting
whether or not you're gonna.</v>

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.269
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna keep that person alone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6696-0

<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6713-0
00:55:25.699 --> 00:55:26.899
<v Hou, Eric>Any other one?</v>

00:55:30.769 --> 00:55:35.089
<v Benbenek, MATT>Maybe the amount of the loan and their

00:55:39.019 --> 00:55:39.659
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6726-0
00:55:39.739 --> 00:55:40.299
<v Hou, Eric>That makes sense.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6728-0
00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:41.839
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Previous default.</v>

00:55:42.149 --> 00:55:43.789
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Our previous loan default.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6740-0
00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:46.939
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, yeah. You you want to know that,
right? Because.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6751-0
00:55:48.479 --> 00:55:51.915
<v Hou, Eric>This is turns out to be very important.
Very important factor,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6751-1
00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.279
<v Hou, Eric>yes and any other things.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6768-0
00:56:04.359 --> 00:56:08.330
<v Haroon, Sufyan>You could also take a look at home
ownership because you could put a lien</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6768-1

00:56:14.519 --> 00:56:15.159
<v Haroon, Sufyan>They default on your loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6783-0
00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:20.499
<v Hou, Eric>Your proportion it means that percent of

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6790-0
00:56:21.499 --> 00:56:23.339
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I mean, the person's home ownership.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6798-0
00:56:23.679 --> 00:56:25.199
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, person, haul me in their ownership.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6809-0
00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:28.754
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
because you want to use as collateral,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6809-1
00:56:28.754 --> 00:56:29.239
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6808-0
00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:29.489
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Lateral.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6815-0
00:56:29.239 --> 00:56:32.119
<v Hou, Eric>So then if they they default,
at least you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6819-0
00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:32.919
<v Hou, Eric>You can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6823-0
00:56:32.999 --> 00:56:35.639
<v Hou, Eric>You, you you can do some damage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6828-0
00:56:37.239 --> 00:56:38.119
<v Hou, Eric>Recovery, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6831-0
00:56:38.119 --> 00:56:38.759
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6837-0
00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:40.719
<v Hou, Eric>You can take that that that home, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6842-0
00:56:40.719 --> 00:56:42.679
<v Hou, Eric>So then if that person running a home.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6854-0
00:56:44.599 --> 00:56:46.719
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
if that person default and then you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6854-1
00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:48.839
<v Hou, Eric>pretty much as a bank,
you are losing money.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6856-0
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.349
<v Hou, Eric>Right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6864-0
00:56:55.359 --> 00:56:57.319
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then I I agree with you guys.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6872-0
00:56:57.319 --> 00:56:59.919
<v Hou, Eric>I think those are the most important
factors, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6877-0
00:56:59.919 --> 00:57:02.999
<v Hou, Eric>So then definitely I guess so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6887-0
00:57:05.799 --> 00:57:09.199
<v Hou, Eric>So from a modeling perspective, right,
so you do have those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6894-0
00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:12.839
<v Hou, Eric>You do have those factors that your data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6911-0
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:20.799
<v Hou, Eric>So that you're really predicting this
long status using all the data that is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6911-1
00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:21.599
<v Hou, Eric>available.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6923-0
00:57:23.319 --> 00:57:25.399
<v Hou, Eric>So here so you have those information,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6928-0
00:57:25.399 --> 00:57:29.479
<v Hou, Eric>So then one thing I have to go out is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6935-0
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:33.869
<v Hou, Eric>For age, for the personal age.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6938-0
00:57:35.759 --> 00:57:36.639
<v Hou, Eric>Those are numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6947-0
00:57:38.399 --> 00:57:41.159
<v Hou, Eric>Right. And then personal income,
this is also numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6952-0
00:57:42.799 --> 00:57:43.999
<v Hou, Eric>Experience this numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6964-0
00:57:45.799 --> 00:57:47.519
<v Hou, Eric>Loan amount is also numbers regular
numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6981-0
00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:55.767
<v Hou, Eric>Those are those are numerical numerical
factors or numerical features. For those,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6981-1
00:57:55.767 --> 00:57:57.879
<v Hou, Eric>those are quite easy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6993-0
00:57:58.719 --> 00:58:03.009
<v Hou, Eric>So you can you can really throw those
numerical numbers into your logistic</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/6993-1
00:58:03.009 --> 00:58:03.639
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7014-0
00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:10.714
<v Hou, Eric>There are also other other factors,
for example like whether or not that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7014-1
00:58:10.714 --> 00:58:15.829
<v Hou, Eric>person default on previous loan,
there will be only two way using yes or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7014-2
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:16.039
<v Hou, Eric>no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7024-0
00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:20.239
<v Hou, Eric>And what is the purpose of the current
loan?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7027-0
00:58:20.239 --> 00:58:21.279
<v Hou, Eric>So it could be personal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7031-0
00:58:21.279 --> 00:58:22.159
<v Hou, Eric>It could be education.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7033-0
00:58:22.159 --> 00:58:22.959
<v Hou, Eric>It could be medical.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7043-0
00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:27.559
<v Hou, Eric>And and what that person education must
high school. Whatever.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7058-0
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:31.218
<v Hou, Eric>And hopefully we do not use the gender as
a factor,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7058-1
00:58:31.218 --> 00:58:34.719
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not a person owns a home is
run on a mortgage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7068-0
00:58:35.439 --> 00:58:39.999
<v Hou, Eric>And those are those are a non numerical
features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7085-0
00:58:41.559 --> 00:58:47.845
<v Hou, Eric>And those are called categorical features
and you have to convert those categorical</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7085-1
00:58:47.845 --> 00:58:48.519
<v Hou, Eric>features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7095-0
00:58:50.239 --> 00:58:51.839
<v Hou, Eric>Into the numerical features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7114-0
00:58:51.879 --> 00:58:56.008
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise,
the logistic regression cannot really use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7114-1
00:58:56.008 --> 00:59:01.228
<v Hou, Eric>the word as a part of input.
So the way how you do that is through</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7114-2
00:59:01.228 --> 00:59:02.319
<v Hou, Eric>this function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7125-0
00:59:06.399 --> 00:59:08.719
<v Hou, Eric>This function called. Well,
it's kind of easy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7129-0
00:59:08.719 --> 00:59:10.119
<v Hou, Eric>Is it called get dummies?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7136-0
00:59:10.119 --> 00:59:12.079
<v Hou, Eric>And so it's a default function in pandas.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7142-0
00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:14.039
<v Hou, Eric>It's really a one off encoding.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7146-0
00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:15.999
<v Hou, Eric>So what does it do?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7163-0
00:59:16.239 --> 00:59:22.293
<v Hou, Eric>Is it's the following.
So for example like there is only four</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7163-1
00:59:22.293 --> 00:59:26.199
<v Hou, Eric>cases of the home ownership, you own it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7168-0
00:59:27.919 --> 00:59:29.479
<v Hou, Eric>And let me show you what I mean.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7178-0
00:59:31.199 --> 00:59:35.279
<v Hou, Eric>There's only four unique values of this
home ownership.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7183-0
00:59:35.279 --> 00:59:37.359
<v Hou, Eric>You run it, you own it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7185-0
00:59:37.359 --> 00:59:40.239
<v Hou, Eric>You sort of own it on mortgage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7195-0
00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:44.229
<v Hou, Eric>Other I have no idea what other case
means.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7198-0
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:47.229
<v Hou, Eric>So then you will create.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7208-0
00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:52.559
<v Hou, Eric>You will separate those four values into
3 columns.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7234-0
00:59:54.399 --> 01:00:00.956
<v Hou, Eric>Where you create a flag associated with
rent A flag associated with own a flag</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7234-1
01:00:00.956 --> 01:00:05.853
<v Hou, Eric>associated mortgage,
but you're not going to create a flag</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7234-2
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:07.679
<v Hou, Eric>associated with other.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7237-0
01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:08.999
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7245-0
01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:12.199
<v Hou, Eric>You do want to have those ones covering
all four cases.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7258-0
01:00:12.469 --> 01:00:17.768
<v Hou, Eric>Because you want to make sure that the 0
value in those three columns actually</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7258-1
01:00:17.768 --> 01:00:18.909
<v Hou, Eric>makes some sense.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7260-0
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:20.789
<v Hou, Eric>Because if you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7275-0
01:00:22.359 --> 01:00:26.679
<v Hou, Eric>Give the one the social all unique values,
the zero actually do not make any sense.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7290-0
01:00:27.279 --> 01:00:33.835
<v Hou, Eric>The zero in the collaborative of those
three column you choose out of those four</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7290-1
01:00:33.835 --> 01:00:37.559
<v Hou, Eric>means the other unique way.
That was 0 means.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7301-0
01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:43.239
<v Hou, Eric>This sort of like whether or not a person
default on previous loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7314-0
01:00:43.899 --> 01:00:48.259
<v Hou, Eric>You only create a value of frag
association, no or yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7321-0
01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:52.259
<v Hou, Eric>Let's let's pretend that you create a
column associated with a.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7339-0
01:00:52.259 --> 01:00:57.069
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
that person did default on previous loan,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7339-1
01:00:57.069 --> 01:01:02.699
<v Hou, Eric>then the zero value in that yes black
column means no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7342-0
01:01:03.299 --> 01:01:05.219
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's what it means.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7349-0
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:08.339
<v Hou, Eric>So that you do not say you have 5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7358-0
01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:12.839
<v Hou, Eric>Or in this one you have six unique values.
You only need 5 columns.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7365-0
01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:14.359
<v Hou, Eric>You have two I use.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7367-0
01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:15.839
<v Hou, Eric>You only need one call.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7374-0
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:18.429
<v Hou, Eric>So you you only need to create.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7407-0
01:01:19.999 --> 01:01:25.023
<v Hou, Eric>An unique value -1 column to make sure
that zero in those n -,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7407-1
01:01:25.023 --> 01:01:29.488
<v Hou, Eric>1 columns means the other one that you
didn't create a.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7407-2
01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:32.359
<v Hou, Eric>You didn't create a specific column.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7411-0
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:33.159
<v Hou, Eric>A social with that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7415-0
01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:35.799
<v Hou, Eric>That's how it works, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7425-0
01:01:35.879 --> 01:01:42.319
<v Hou, Eric>So that eventually you have you have
default yes column you have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7432-0
01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:46.519
<v Hou, Eric>Long intent like home improvement,
medical, personal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7439-0
01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:49.229
<v Hou, Eric>Column and education.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7442-0
01:01:49.229 --> 01:01:52.069
<v Hou, Eric>The one you didn't include is personal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7480-0
01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:59.160
<v Hou, Eric>And and you you have all the columns to
just create from running this code and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7480-1
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.074
<v Hou, Eric>and and Python will automatically do that
work for you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7480-2
01:02:03.074 --> 01:02:06.639
<v Hou, Eric>But you have to know the reason you did
not model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7491-0
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:10.662
<v Hou, Eric>No,
just because the zero in the yes actually</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7491-1
01:02:10.662 --> 01:02:11.799
<v Hou, Eric>means no. OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7494-0
01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:14.039
<v Hou, Eric>You have those columns created.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7501-0
01:02:15.639 --> 01:02:18.119
<v Hou, Eric>And and then you can actually incorporate
those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7511-0
01:02:18.509 --> 01:02:23.109
<v Hou, Eric>Was can you recall variables in the
logistic regression?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7527-0
01:02:24.279 --> 01:02:28.319
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just this is the way that you can
definitely do the logistical regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7538-0
01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:34.199
<v Hou, Eric>I actually split the data into a trained
data and test the data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7566-0
01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:39.108
<v Hou, Eric>So the training and test data is I want
to train a model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7566-1
01:02:39.108 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Hou, Eric>I want to hold out the test data as a
individual separate group.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7566-2
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.839
<v Hou, Eric>I do not want the the computer want the
machine to learn.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7575-0
01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:53.719
<v Hou, Eric>From the test data and then I can test my
model on the test data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7613-0
01:02:54.669 --> 01:02:59.872
<v Hou, Eric>There's going to be a a bias virus
balance that we gonna touch base in, in,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7613-1
01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:04.938
<v Hou, Eric>in the second-half of the class.
And there's a purpose of doing that just</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7613-2
01:03:04.938 --> 01:03:09.593
<v Hou, Eric>from a concept perspective,
you want to you want to learn something</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7613-3
01:03:09.593 --> 01:03:11.989
<v Hou, Eric>and and still making sense to have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7619-0
01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:14.179
<v Hou, Eric>Final exam because you know the real
professor.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7629-0
01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:19.019
<v Hou, Eric>Want to know whether or not you actually
learn from the class.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7641-0
01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:22.619
<v Hou, Eric>You know you can consider as test data
set as your final exam for this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7651-0
01:03:22.619 --> 01:03:26.334
<v Hou, Eric>For this model,
I split the data into train and test and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7651-1
01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:27.899
<v Hou, Eric>run logistic regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7667-0
01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:35.109
<v Hou, Eric>I feed this logistic regression on the X
train, meaning those features I have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7673-0
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:38.349
<v Hou, Eric>Against those 01 values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7676-0
01:03:40.189 --> 01:03:40.509
<v Hou, Eric>As my target.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7702-0
01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:47.474
<v Hou, Eric>So that I will have the probability
coming out of the place and I can create</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7702-1
01:03:47.474 --> 01:03:52.177
<v Hou, Eric>a confusion matrix.
I can create this AUC and Roc curve that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7702-2
01:03:52.177 --> 01:03:53.179
<v Hou, Eric>I showed you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7708-0
01:03:53.739 --> 01:03:56.659
<v Hou, Eric>So this is actually my confusion matrix.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7721-0
01:03:56.659 --> 01:04:01.155
<v Hou, Eric>Again,
this confusion Matrix is based upon the .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7721-1
01:04:01.155 --> 01:04:02.899
<v Hou, Eric>5 as the threshold.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7740-0
01:04:04.469 --> 01:04:08.866
<v Hou, Eric>If you want to change for all the
classification model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7740-1
01:04:08.866 --> 01:04:12.949
<v Hou, Eric>if you name it logistic regression,
namely network.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7750-0
01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:16.939
<v Hou, Eric>Name it tree models. .
5 is the default value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7756-0
01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:19.259
<v Hou, Eric>It does not mean you cannot change it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7767-0
01:04:19.339 --> 01:04:23.339
<v Hou, Eric>It just means that default and you can
change as needed.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7796-0
01:04:23.779 --> 01:04:30.765
<v Hou, Eric>And this confusion matrix is how I'm
telling whether or not I should for this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7796-1
01:04:30.765 --> 01:04:34.796
<v Hou, Eric>101.
5 I should approve their loans and then</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7796-2
01:04:34.796 --> 01:04:38.379
<v Hou, Eric>and actually the data is telling me yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7799-0
01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:40.179
<v Hou, Eric>And then in reality, they prove.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7800-0
01:04:40.379 --> 01:04:40.979
<v Hou, Eric>They prove them.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7813-0
01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:45.136
<v Hou, Eric>For those guys,
I should not be approving their loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7813-1
01:04:45.136 --> 01:04:46.589
<v Hou, Eric>In reality, they did it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7822-0
01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:50.659
<v Hou, Eric>And those are the false positive and
false negative ones.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7826-0
01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:53.269
<v Hou, Eric>And the model isn't perfect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7846-0
01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:59.979
<v Hou, Eric>Isn't perfect and accuracy is a .
85 is not perfect at all,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7846-1
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:04.679
<v Hou, Eric>but the the area under curve is .
87 is definitely better.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7851-0
01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:07.619
<v Hou, Eric>Then a pure gas much better.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7856-0
01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:11.989
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And here are the numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7863-0
01:05:13.669 --> 01:05:15.909
<v Hou, Eric>And this is the way to show you that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7883-0
01:05:17.699 --> 01:05:24.518
<v Hou, Eric>Say I use different values.
How am I going to miss class different</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7883-1
01:05:24.518 --> 01:05:26.859
<v Hou, Eric>cases so default is .5?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7902-0
01:05:26.859 --> 01:05:30.897
<v Hou, Eric>I have those cases randomly selected one
I use .2.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7902-1
01:05:30.897 --> 01:05:34.619
<v Hou, Eric>It seems like I I misclassified a lot of
here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7925-0
01:05:34.619 --> 01:05:38.969
<v Hou, Eric>It should have been classified as zero
because I'm lower.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7925-1
01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:43.619
<v Hou, Eric>I put this line right here so that I I I
predict them as one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7928-0
01:05:43.619 --> 01:05:45.299
<v Hou, Eric>However, they just misclassified.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7934-0
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.509
<v Hou, Eric>I use .4. It's getting better.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7946-0
01:05:49.019 --> 01:05:51.939
<v Hou, Eric>Because I I I didn't misclassify those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7970-0
01:05:51.939 --> 01:05:56.848
<v Hou, Eric>They should have been classified as zero
and then and now is classified as zero.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7970-1
01:05:56.848 --> 01:06:01.819
<v Hou, Eric>But still for those guys I misclassified
and I'm just moving the the line around.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7985-0
01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:07.041
<v Hou, Eric>Just show you guys moving the threshold
away from this .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7985-1
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:10.339
<v Hou, Eric>5 how the same data gonna look like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/7998-0
01:06:11.909 --> 01:06:15.669
<v Hou, Eric>They they look like differently and then
you have different misclassification.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8012-0
01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:24.069
<v Hou, Eric>And this is how I show you how this ar
OCAOC is calculated.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8018-0
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:27.749
<v Hou, Eric>This is based upon different threshold,
for example.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8026-0
01:06:31.419 --> 01:06:37.659
<v Hou, Eric>Hi the way I know whether you really like
click everything I'll.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8040-0
01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:48.279
<v Hou, Eric>So for example this this is one close to
perfect, one is .5 this is this one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8071-0
01:06:48.799 --> 01:06:52.822
<v Hou, Eric>So this telling you that you are using a
thread hold .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8071-1
01:06:52.822 --> 01:06:58.234
<v Hou, Eric>51 and those are the metrics associated
with it and how the tprf rfpr are</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8071-2
01:06:58.234 --> 01:06:59.039
<v Hou, Eric>calculated.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8079-0
01:07:00.989 --> 01:07:04.829
<v Hou, Eric>So it's really on this Roc curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8083-0
01:07:07.379 --> 01:07:08.539
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8107-0
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:13.763
<v Hou, Eric>So from now on,
since we are using a classification model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8107-1
01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:17.789
<v Hou, Eric>there's one thing is called the future
importance. What is that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8115-0
01:07:18.229 --> 01:07:21.829
<v Hou, Eric>So remember, I asked you before I run.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8118-0
01:07:21.949 --> 01:07:23.109
<v Hou, Eric>I run this model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8121-0
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:24.749
<v Hou, Eric>What do you think?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8147-0
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:31.163
<v Hou, Eric>Are the most important factors you'll be
giving that person alone your, your.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8147-1
01:07:31.163 --> 01:07:34.557
<v Hou, Eric>You guys said OK,
I need to take care of that person's</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8147-2
01:07:34.557 --> 01:07:34.989
<v Hou, Eric>income.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8153-0
01:07:35.429 --> 01:07:38.429
<v Hou, Eric>I need to take care of that person's home
ownership.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8177-0
01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:43.935
<v Hou, Eric>And the loan amount,
the credit score and and and whether or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8177-1
01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:50.449
<v Hou, Eric>not a person default in the previous loan
that that person default previously so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8179-0
01:07:53.579 --> 01:07:53.699
<v Hou, Eric>Hmm.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8197-0
01:07:56.719 --> 01:08:03.060
<v Hou, Eric>This feature importance data is going to
tell you you can actually quantify the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8197-1
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.279
<v Hou, Eric>importance of those factors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8200-0
01:08:07.299 --> 01:08:08.339
<v Hou, Eric>And turns out.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8215-0
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:17.189
<v Hou, Eric>If a person default in their previous
loan, it is a huge negative impact.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8241-0
01:08:18.909 --> 01:08:26.620
<v Hou, Eric>For the model to decide whether or not it
will approve your next loan,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8241-1
01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:33.570
<v Hou, Eric>this is not a single factor,
but this is definitely one biggest</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8241-2
01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:38.349
<v Hou, Eric>negative impact to your next loan
approval.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8271-0
01:08:38.659 --> 01:08:46.790
<v Hou, Eric>All process very negative and if you use
if your ownership is a friend. However,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8271-1
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:54.419
<v Hou, Eric>it's a really positive and interest rate
is is. Is higher is also positive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8280-0
01:08:54.419 --> 01:08:58.819
<v Hou, Eric>This is sort of like why the banks are
doing business with you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8297-0
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.700
<v Hou, Eric>So you're saying that I'm running same
amount of loan and I'm saying I'm</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8297-1
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.419
<v Hou, Eric>offering you. I'm accepting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8305-0
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.389
<v Hou, Eric>Higher interest rate.
I'm accepting more risky.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8323-0
01:09:09.459 --> 01:09:14.006
<v Hou, Eric>Right from my end, not the bank's end.
And the banks can definitely earn some</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8323-1
01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:14.939
<v Hou, Eric>premium from me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8331-0
01:09:15.099 --> 01:09:18.779
<v Hou, Eric>So the banks are more willing to to, to,
to give you a loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8341-0
01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:23.979
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is maybe the risk of giving
the person alone is high.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8359-0
01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:28.439
<v Hou, Eric>However,
the the high interest rate is compensate</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8359-1
01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:31.739
<v Hou, Eric>that risk that the bank is suffering.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8364-0
01:09:32.099 --> 01:09:35.219
<v Hou, Eric>So that is something that a positive to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8368-0
01:09:35.989 --> 01:09:36.629
<v Hou, Eric>The approval decision.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8376-0
01:09:38.419 --> 01:09:41.499
<v Hou, Eric>And definitely your work experience is
adding.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8398-0
01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:47.029
<v Hou, Eric>A positive value, however, the age is not.
The bank is old,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8398-1
01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:50.989
<v Hou, Eric>is definitely worrying whether or not you
have enough work.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8405-0
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:54.429
<v Hou, Eric>Years to repay the loan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8433-0
01:09:54.429 --> 01:09:59.193
<v Hou, Eric>So then it is definitely not good,
but I'm not quite sure whether or not you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8433-1
01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:02.720
<v Hou, Eric>know the current banks are still using
this information,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8433-2
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.989
<v Hou, Eric>or if there is any discrimination kind of
effort associated with it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8443-0
01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:12.518
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not sure,
but in case they wanna use that is, is,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8443-1
01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:14.069
<v Hou, Eric>is is how it works.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8457-0
01:10:17.109 --> 01:10:21.949
<v Hou, Eric>And also they you say this long,
intense education, unfortunately.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8469-0
01:10:23.549 --> 01:10:26.107
<v Hou, Eric>Is, is, is,
is not positive which is kind of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8469-1
01:10:26.107 --> 01:10:26.789
<v Hou, Eric>interesting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8479-0
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:29.387
<v Hou, Eric>And also,
you're only in the home and it is an</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8479-1
01:10:29.387 --> 01:10:29.709
<v Hou, Eric>active.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8480-0
01:10:29.749 --> 01:10:32.109
<v Hou, Eric>I think those are really.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8487-0
01:10:34.619 --> 01:10:37.579
<v Hou, Eric>Questionable from this logistic
regression results.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8502-0
01:10:39.379 --> 01:10:44.899
<v Hou, Eric>And and that's sort of the story from
this long case and from the slides.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8509-0
01:10:45.179 --> 01:10:48.219
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
we got this default is very important.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8532-0
01:10:48.219 --> 01:10:51.884
<v Hou, Eric>The credit score varying for loan amount
ownership income,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8532-1
01:10:51.884 --> 01:10:56.544
<v Hou, Eric>as I think we miss is interest rate and
turns out from this data from this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8532-2
01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.899
<v Hou, Eric>logistic regression model interest rate
is important.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8543-0
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:06.509
<v Hou, Eric>Some data I created for this is I do want
to show you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8546-0
01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:09.909
<v Hou, Eric>How run is?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8548-0
01:11:10.579 --> 01:11:11.139
<v Hou, Eric>On excel.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8550-0
01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:13.349
<v Hou, Eric>Instead of Python.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8557-0
01:11:16.279 --> 01:11:20.759
<v Hou, Eric>I output the data into this excel.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8560-0
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:24.309
<v Hou, Eric>Like what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8570-0
01:11:24.309 --> 01:11:26.989
<v Hou, Eric>I said we are now running a linear
regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8580-0
01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:30.829
<v Hou, Eric>We are actually running a logistic
regression model just in case, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8584-0
01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.589
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just out of curiosity.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8590-0
01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:36.469
<v Hou, Eric>I want to run a linear regression model I
did.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8598-0
01:11:38.029 --> 01:11:40.829
<v Hou, Eric>And those are the coefficients and those
are P values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8614-0
01:11:44.309 --> 01:11:47.019
<v Hou, Eric>Arguably,
they may align with the logistic</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8614-1
01:11:47.019 --> 01:11:50.549
<v Hou, Eric>regression in terms of how important
those factors are.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8617-0
01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:53.779
<v Hou, Eric>But this is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8622-0
01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:58.549
<v Hou, Eric>The outcome of your linear regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8630-0
01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.669
<v Hou, Eric>The issue of linear regression is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8661-0
01:12:04.429 --> 01:12:09.384
<v Hou, Eric>You the values can be really between zero
and one and varying really a lot.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8661-1
01:12:09.384 --> 01:12:13.949
<v Hou, Eric>And as you can see those are values I'm
supposed to predict as zeros.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8673-0
01:12:13.949 --> 01:12:18.228
<v Hou, Eric>I'm hoping they're close to 0,
but they're close to 0 and then they're</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8673-1
01:12:18.228 --> 01:12:18.469
<v Hou, Eric>not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8682-0
01:12:18.469 --> 01:12:21.949
<v Hou, Eric>They're varying between zero and one,
and some of them negative values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8694-0
01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:26.532
<v Hou, Eric>For linear regression models,
you do not really have any control of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8694-1
01:12:26.532 --> 01:12:27.219
<v Hou, Eric>those values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8696-0
01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:28.259
<v Hou, Eric>Harron, any question.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8702-0
01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.649
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I had a question.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8716-0
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:37.310
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So could we place more weight on certain
binary variables such as like previous</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8716-1
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:38.809
<v Haroon, Sufyan>loan default rate?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8747-0
01:12:40.349 --> 01:12:45.312
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Could we rather than just scaling the
entire data set and all the variables in</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8747-1
01:12:45.312 --> 01:12:47.762
<v Haroon, Sufyan>it?
Could we do put a heavy penalty on</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8747-2
01:12:47.762 --> 01:12:51.469
<v Haroon, Sufyan>previous default rate compared to other
variables because.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8752-0
01:12:51.789 --> 01:12:53.229
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8761-0
01:12:53.229 --> 01:12:57.149
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the parameter tuning process
you're talking about.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8770-0
01:12:57.149 --> 01:13:00.229
<v Hou, Eric>There are so many parameters that you can
tweak, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8774-0
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:02.429
<v Hou, Eric>So then yes, totally totally.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8780-0
01:13:02.429 --> 01:13:05.829
<v Hou, Eric>I I'm just basically using the outer box
function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8790-0
01:13:07.389 --> 01:13:11.029
<v Hou, Eric>And and and and. Unfortunately, Haroon,
you are real work.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8796-0
01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.669
<v Hou, Eric>You may have to do a lot of primary
tuning.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8802-0
01:13:14.869 --> 01:13:17.069
<v Hou, Eric>What and what?
What Haroon is talking about?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8809-0
01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:21.109
<v Hou, Eric>What is a parameter tuning is for each
function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8826-0
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:26.940
<v Hou, Eric>This threshold is called.
Remember we have different true positive</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8826-1
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.789
<v Hou, Eric>rate and false positive rate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8860-0
01:13:28.789 --> 01:13:33.218
<v Hou, Eric>Those kind of numbers,
those kind of metrics associated with one</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8860-1
01:13:33.218 --> 01:13:38.670
<v Hou, Eric>classification model and then the reason
I told you and I also told you guys we</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8860-2
01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:42.350
<v Hou, Eric>are using .
5 as a threshold the threshold equal to .</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8860-3
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:43.509
<v Hou, Eric>5 is a parameter.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8865-0
01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.219
<v Hou, Eric>Of that model, what is the parameter?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8873-0
01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:48.789
<v Hou, Eric>A model is considered.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8878-0
01:13:48.789 --> 01:13:49.829
<v Hou, Eric>This is a function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8884-0
01:13:49.829 --> 01:13:51.949
<v Hou, Eric>This is a. This is a machine, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8891-0
01:13:51.949 --> 01:13:55.709
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have some input and the
machine gonna generate some output.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8907-0
01:13:57.389 --> 01:14:03.829
<v Hou, Eric>What I am showing you is sort of like I
receive an iPhone from Apple, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8915-0
01:14:03.869 --> 01:14:05.949
<v Hou, Eric>I just wanna start using the iPhone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8920-0
01:14:05.949 --> 01:14:07.229
<v Hou, Eric>I just use everything.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8925-0
01:14:07.829 --> 01:14:11.589
<v Hou, Eric>All default values that's set by Apple,
not like me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8933-0
01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:15.229
<v Hou, Eric>So then I give me pretty good use user
experience.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8943-0
01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:21.009
<v Hou, Eric>What Haroon is, is is talking about is,
you know what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8949-0
01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.539
<v Hou, Eric>I want you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8953-0
01:14:23.539 --> 01:14:25.499
<v Hou, Eric>I want to use my iPhone for.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8964-0
01:14:27.069 --> 01:14:29.349
<v Hou, Eric>I want to use my iPhone for communication.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8971-0
01:14:29.389 --> 01:14:31.749
<v Hou, Eric>I want to use my iPhone for stock trading.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8983-0
01:14:31.749 --> 01:14:35.309
<v Hou, Eric>I want to use my iPhone for different for
different purposes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/8989-0
01:14:35.749 --> 01:14:38.989
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to change your iPhone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9010-0
01:14:38.989 --> 01:14:41.709
<v Hou, Eric>You need to go to the setting.
You need to go to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9010-1
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:45.789
<v Hou, Eric>Setting general to change your iPhone in
a way that maximize your benefit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9023-0
01:14:46.269 --> 01:14:50.036
<v Hou, Eric>So the The thing is you are changing on
your iPhone. In general,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9023-1
01:14:50.036 --> 01:14:51.949
<v Hou, Eric>those are sort of the parameters.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9035-0
01:14:52.299 --> 01:14:57.059
<v Hou, Eric>Because you're tailoring the iPhone for
your own purposes now.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9037-0
01:14:57.379 --> 01:14:58.579
<v Hou, Eric>Make sense to you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9054-0
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:04.509
<v Hou, Eric>May not make sense for me or other people,
but it's definitely maximize your benefit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9072-0
01:15:04.909 --> 01:15:09.218
<v Hou, Eric>So that is called and that is sort of how
you change those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9072-1
01:15:09.218 --> 01:15:14.749
<v Hou, Eric>Those values in in a general setting of
iPhone is called a parameter tuning.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9089-0
01:15:16.469 --> 01:15:20.344
<v Hou, Eric>And and and and there are so many
techniques about, you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9089-1
01:15:20.344 --> 01:15:22.469
<v Hou, Eric>the great search parameter tuning.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9092-0
01:15:22.699 --> 01:15:23.619
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9105-0
01:15:25.299 --> 01:15:31.019
<v Hou, Eric>You know the way how you feel,
the most comfortable to use a iPhone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9130-0
01:15:31.019 --> 01:15:35.801
<v Hou, Eric>Then that's something that is a number,
assuming you have the number,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9130-1
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:40.311
<v Hou, Eric>you know that's a number you want iPhone
to maximize or minimize,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9130-2
01:15:40.311 --> 01:15:42.019
<v Hou, Eric>and then you give iPhone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9132-0
01:15:43.549 --> 01:15:43.709
<v Hou, Eric>A task.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9135-0
01:15:45.269 --> 01:15:45.869
<v Hou, Eric>An iPhone.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9149-0
01:15:46.029 --> 01:15:51.858
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty smart,
and it can learn and change itself to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9149-1
01:15:51.858 --> 01:15:55.109
<v Hou, Eric>meet your your to to address.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9172-0
01:15:55.579 --> 01:16:02.165
<v Hou, Eric>To to to meet your criteria of success,
so that eventually going to be your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9172-1
01:16:02.165 --> 01:16:03.899
<v Hou, Eric>iPhone only for you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9179-0
01:16:04.499 --> 01:16:06.739
<v Hou, Eric>So that's called the parameter tuning
that's called.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9189-0
01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:11.179
<v Hou, Eric>There are so many techniques around the
correct tuning, I doubt if that could be.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9222-0
01:16:13.429 --> 01:16:16.410
<v Hou, Eric>Going to be some content material that in
this class,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9222-1
01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:21.048
<v Hou, Eric>but if you're taking any machine learning
or data science specific computer science</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9222-2
01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:25.189
<v Hou, Eric>or data science major kind of class,
they will definitely talk about that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9266-0
01:16:26.809 --> 01:16:30.801
<v Hou, Eric>But with that being said,
that could be a really cool project you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9266-1
01:16:30.801 --> 01:16:35.034
<v Hou, Eric>guys work on for the final.
If you want to work on some proper tuning</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9266-2
01:16:35.034 --> 01:16:39.329
<v Hou, Eric>and then explore different parameters
that could be really good topic.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9271-0
01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:42.609
<v Hou, Eric>So Harron did,
did that answer your question?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9281-0
01:16:42.609 --> 01:16:46.209
<v Hou, Eric>Do you want to add some content on that
and then any suggestion? Any feedback?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9287-0
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:49.189
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I had a quote specific question.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9313-0
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:54.475
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So when we do scaling,
could you the scaling code the line of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9295-0
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:51.789
<v Hou, Eric>Yes. Yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9313-1
01:16:54.475 --> 01:16:58.909
<v Haroon, Sufyan>code where we says like scaling or
standardization?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9326-0
01:16:59.149 --> 01:17:04.801
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Could we just specify 1 variable to have
twice X much more weight compared to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9326-1
01:17:04.801 --> 01:17:05.309
<v Haroon, Sufyan>others?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9335-0
01:17:05.979 --> 01:17:08.579
<v Hou, Eric>I I think you can use the weight function
to do that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9350-0
01:17:09.339 --> 01:17:12.099
<v Hou, Eric>There is a there is a there is a weight
function that you can define.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9338-0
01:17:09.479 --> 01:17:09.879
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9361-0
01:17:12.099 --> 01:17:15.539
<v Hou, Eric>You want to put more weight on that and
then you can definitely talk offline.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9383-0
01:17:15.539 --> 01:17:19.928
<v Hou, Eric>I I think this is some question we can
discuss on coding and I'm not sure the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9383-1
01:17:19.928 --> 01:17:23.699
<v Hou, Eric>other folks are still sort of interested
in that in that question.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9387-0
01:17:23.699 --> 01:17:25.099
<v Hou, Eric>Can we can we talk about that offline?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9389-0
01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:26.329
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9392-0
01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:27.619
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9402-0
01:17:29.589 --> 01:17:33.269
<v Hou, Eric>Linear regression. Even if I have this,
I didn't do want to show you that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9409-0
01:17:35.069 --> 01:17:37.229
<v Hou, Eric>In case you want to run.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9418-0
01:17:42.549 --> 01:17:45.829
<v Hou, Eric>Logistic regression on on Excel.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9426-0
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:49.349
<v Hou, Eric>Here's the data I can show you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9435-0
01:17:49.349 --> 01:17:52.869
<v Hou, Eric>And then I don't recommend,
but there's a way that you can do it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9443-0
01:17:53.749 --> 01:17:55.749
<v Hou, Eric>So I copy the data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9455-0
01:17:55.909 --> 01:18:00.552
<v Hou, Eric>The column Zero is a long status as you
can see there is only two user and one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9455-1
01:18:00.552 --> 01:18:01.829
<v Hou, Eric>You can ignore blanks.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9472-0
01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:07.151
<v Hou, Eric>And then there are so many columns or I
just copy paste from the data that you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9472-1
01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:08.079
<v Hou, Eric>know as a feature.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9482-0
01:18:12.749 --> 01:18:16.789
<v Hou, Eric>And I I say I I said target for myself.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9486-0
01:18:16.789 --> 01:18:17.509
<v Hou, Eric>OK, you know what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9491-0
01:18:17.509 --> 01:18:18.949
<v Hou, Eric>I'm I'm going to use.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9500-0
01:18:19.349 --> 01:18:24.269
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to use progressions and I do
not want to use any of those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9504-0
01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:27.949
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9515-0
01:18:29.949 --> 01:18:33.709
<v Hou, Eric>Excel cannot handle more than a specific
number of columns.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9546-0
01:18:35.539 --> 01:18:42.617
<v Hou, Eric>So if your data has let's say 20 columns
and then you cannot use all 20 columns as</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9546-1
01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:49.099
<v Hou, Eric>a regressors either for logistic
regression or or or or regular regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9549-0
01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:49.939
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9556-0
01:18:49.939 --> 01:18:53.699
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot use so many number of columns
unfortunately.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9566-0
01:18:53.739 --> 01:18:56.179
<v Hou, Eric>So I have to delete them and then I run.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9567-0
01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:56.339
<v Hou, Eric>I run.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9578-0
01:18:56.339 --> 01:19:00.453
<v Hou, Eric>The model is now working as well,
so then I decide only to use three of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9578-1
01:19:00.453 --> 01:19:00.739
<v Hou, Eric>them.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9587-0
01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:03.949
<v Hou, Eric>The age,
the the income and whether or not they</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9587-1
01:19:03.949 --> 01:19:04.349
<v Hou, Eric>default.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9600-0
01:19:05.609 --> 01:19:09.209
<v Hou, Eric>So you the way how you do it,
it just basically gives default values.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9605-0
01:19:09.569 --> 01:19:11.009
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just copy those values here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9624-0
01:19:12.549 --> 01:19:18.224
<v Hou, Eric>You give some default values. To do that,
there's some preparation you you need to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9624-1
01:19:18.224 --> 01:19:18.429
<v Hou, Eric>do.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9626-0
01:19:18.429 --> 01:19:20.469
<v Hou, Eric>Is one is called legit?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9634-0
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:23.949
<v Hou, Eric>It's based upon your default value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9644-0
01:19:24.269 --> 01:19:29.148
<v Hou, Eric>You just your your.
This is going to be your or your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9644-1
01:19:29.148 --> 01:19:30.069
<v Hou, Eric>intercept.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9647-0
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:32.549
<v Hou, Eric>Constant intercept.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9663-0
01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:39.991
<v Hou, Eric>Your age. Multiply the age parameter,
age coefficient, the income multiply,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9663-1
01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:41.949
<v Hou, Eric>and then let me just hide.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9667-0
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.669
<v Hou, Eric>You know what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9670-0
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:44.109
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just hide in those columns.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9672-0
01:19:44.459 --> 01:19:45.579
<v Hou, Eric>No, I'm not going to use.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9674-0
01:19:47.479 --> 01:19:48.399
<v Hou, Eric>Make it easier to see.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9681-0
01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:52.429
<v Hou, Eric>OK, this legit column.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9693-0
01:19:54.939 --> 01:20:01.339
<v Hou, Eric>Is your constant intercept column value
initial value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9697-0
01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.939
<v Hou, Eric>You can just put whatever value here plus.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9715-0
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:11.565

01:20:19.433 --> 01:20:20.749
<v Hou, Eric>You have this number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9738-0
01:20:22.879 --> 01:20:26.319
<v Hou, Eric>The column V is going to be the
exponential of this number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9753-0
01:20:27.869 --> 01:20:32.269
<v Hou, Eric>The exponential of this number and then
you calculate the probability in a way.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9763-0
01:20:32.429 --> 01:20:36.629
<v Hou, Eric>Here's a formula and I can prove the
formula is basically a sensitivity.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9795-0
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:42.365
<v Hou, Eric>Numbers and you just calculate in a way,
say it's one or zero.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9795-1
01:20:42.365 --> 01:20:47.553
<v Hou, Eric>Based upon this long status and you have
the formula I can share with you this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9795-2
01:20:47.553 --> 01:20:52.149
<v Hou, Eric>this excel and you calculate the logistic
natural log of this number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9805-0
01:20:52.499 --> 01:20:56.779
<v Hou, Eric>Of this probability you have this log
likelihood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9822-0
01:20:58.709 --> 01:21:06.549
<v Hou, Eric>I have more than 1000 rows and then
eventually I have this one on the 1000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9845-0
01:21:06.549 --> 01:21:12.941
<v Hou, Eric>1st Row is a summation of the likelihood,
so that is the summation of all the</v>

<v Hou, Eric>I have this so you once you have this
this framework setup.</v>

01:21:22.659 --> 01:21:27.929
<v Hou, Eric>On your excel, OK,
you only focus on three columns and you</v>

01:21:27.929 --> 01:21:35.165

01:21:36.859 --> 01:21:42.804
<v Hou, Eric>What you need to do is you go to the data
and you need to use a function of Excel</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/9903-1
01:21:42.804 --> 01:21:43.819

01:21:48.244 --> 01:21:49.149
<v Hou, Eric>you can go to home.</v>

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:18.509
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, it could be provisions.</v>

01:22:27.099 --> 01:22:28.059
<v Hou, Eric>OK, anyways.</v>

01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:39.469
<v Hou, Eric>Wait, how am I close that? OK,
so in the data you have this solver.</v>

01:24:06.029 --> 01:24:11.237
<v Hou, Eric>Are those are going to be your
coefficient associated with a logistic</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10129-1
01:24:11.237 --> 01:24:13.469
<v Hou, Eric>regression you build on Excel.</v>

01:24:17.479 --> 01:24:21.985
<v Hou, Eric>Not as accurate compared to Python.
If I have to make a comment,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10163-1
01:24:21.985 --> 01:24:27.324
<v Hou, Eric>but if you have to quickly build some
logistic regression through using your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10163-2
01:24:27.324 --> 01:24:28.919
<v Hou, Eric>Excel, this is the way.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10188-0
01:24:30.949 --> 01:24:36.023
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And I'll upload to T2L,
you guys can play around with and then</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10188-1
01:24:36.023 --> 01:24:38.749
<v Hou, Eric>please do not use so many variables.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10198-0
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:45.629
<v Hou, Eric>Excel is not good enough to handle like
many variables in in this regression.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10200-0
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:46.549
<v Hou, Eric>Not so great.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10203-0
01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:49.099
<v Hou, Eric>Not proud of it so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10226-0
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:54.497
<v Hou, Eric>Running logistic through Python or
different programming languages still the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10226-1
01:24:54.497 --> 01:24:57.629
<v Hou, Eric>best choice that you can have to have a
more accurate results.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10235-0
01:24:59.669 --> 01:25:03.429
<v Hou, Eric>Just want to show that Excel can do it OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10250-0
01:25:06.369 --> 01:25:10.729
<v Hou, Eric>I think that's is sort of like what we
want to cover the classification models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10261-0
01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:16.526
<v Hou, Eric>So several examples,
and then hopefully you gonna enjoy it and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10261-1
01:25:16.526 --> 01:25:19.369
<v Hou, Eric>then we can take a 10 minute break.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10275-0
01:25:19.889 --> 01:25:24.849
<v Hou, Eric>The reason 10 versus 15 is remember last
time we we we finished already.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10282-0
01:25:24.849 --> 01:25:26.929
<v Hou, Eric>So then I still owe you guys 5 minutes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10296-0
01:25:26.929 --> 01:25:33.089
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's do 10 minute break.
So we come back at 7:10, we continue to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10301-0
01:25:33.869 --> 01:25:35.069
<v Hou, Eric>Nonlinear model, called Kenyan.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10310-0
01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:39.469
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions before we we take a break?
Any questions?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10324-0
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:42.147
<v Hou, Eric>Haroon,
if you want to take a use of the break to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10324-1
01:25:42.147 --> 01:25:44.229
<v Hou, Eric>to talk about that question, totally fine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10327-0
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:46.109
<v Hou, Eric>But any other folks?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10329-0
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.909
<v Hou, Eric>Any other questions?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10333-0
01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:01.119
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10339-0
01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:03.399
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll see you guys around 7:10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10346-0
01:26:05.269 --> 01:26:05.789
<v Hou, Eric>Take a break.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10348-0
01:26:05.789 --> 01:26:07.749
<v Hou, Eric>We will come back at 7:10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10358-0
01:26:13.909 --> 01:26:15.189
<v Hou, Eric>Hey Haroon, are you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10371-0
01:26:15.949 --> 01:26:19.829
<v Hou, Eric>Do you wanna talk this problem now or or
in the office hour after you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10375-0
01:26:20.559 --> 01:26:22.079
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I'll come to the office hour tomorrow.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10384-0
01:26:22.779 --> 01:26:25.259
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK to come in. Staff is our tomorrow,
OK?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10388-0
01:26:25.259 --> 01:26:25.899
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds good.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10391-0
01:26:26.179 --> 01:26:27.219
<v Hou, Eric>So you have some code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10394-0
01:26:27.219 --> 01:26:28.059
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can discuss.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10408-0
01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:31.894
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep,
I'll bring a copy of a code I'm working</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10408-1
01:26:31.894 --> 01:26:33.539
<v Haroon, Sufyan>on currently for a different class.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10422-0
01:26:34.099 --> 01:26:36.459
<v Hou, Eric>OK. I yeah, we have to use online.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10425-0
01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:38.579
<v Hou, Eric>Unfortunately, Harun, the reason I don't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10430-0
01:26:38.659 --> 01:26:40.579
<v Hou, Eric>I really do not have an office in in
markets.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10433-0
01:26:41.819 --> 01:26:42.379
<v Haroon, Sufyan>No worries.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10438-0
01:26:42.699 --> 01:26:43.019
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10445-0
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:45.549
<v Hou, Eric>But by the way,
did I read your name correctly, Haroon?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10448-0
01:26:46.069 --> 01:26:46.749
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep, that's correct.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10450-0
01:26:47.339 --> 01:26:48.019
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10465-0
01:26:48.259 --> 01:26:52.186
<v Hou, Eric>I'll see you in a office hour.
I'll set up office hour and send you guys</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10465-1
01:26:52.186 --> 01:26:52.939
<v Hou, Eric>an invite, OK?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10468-0
01:26:53.719 --> 01:26:54.279
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Thank you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10473-0
01:26:54.529 --> 01:26:56.649
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, I'll see you in 10 minutes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10614-0
01:37:10.849 --> 01:37:11.569
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10623-0
01:37:32.409 --> 01:37:36.169
<v Hou, Eric>All right. Bye. My watch 711 now.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10625-0
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.989
<v Hou, Eric>Let's talk about this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10628-0
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:41.029
<v Hou, Eric>So we.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10638-0
01:37:43.069 --> 01:37:47.149
<v Hou, Eric>We were basically covering right now all
the other linear models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10660-0
01:37:48.949 --> 01:37:51.760
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
a linear regression model and then I I</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10660-1
01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.469
<v Hou, Eric>will consider logistic regression as a
linear model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10674-0
01:37:54.469 --> 01:38:00.180
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is that you you pretty much
just apply a transform function to the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10674-1
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.669
<v Hou, Eric>data and then and then eventually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10697-0
01:38:03.659 --> 01:38:08.589
<v Hou, Eric>You're still using a linear regression
between the variables against the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10697-1
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:12.438
<v Hou, Eric>transformed data,
so so that's why I'm still saying this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10697-2
01:38:12.438 --> 01:38:14.059
<v Hou, Eric>linear regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10699-0
01:38:14.059 --> 01:38:15.779
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just share my screen.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10702-0
01:38:21.469 --> 01:38:22.349
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10718-0
01:38:23.909 --> 01:38:28.079
<v Hou, Eric>However,
right so then the the linear regression</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10718-1
01:38:28.079 --> 01:38:31.229
<v Hou, Eric>model versus the the real world data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10721-0
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:32.789
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a quite different.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10732-0
01:38:34.509 --> 01:38:39.229
<v Hou, Eric>There are so many nonlinear relationship
between the variables.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10739-0
01:38:40.989 --> 01:38:44.309
<v Hou, Eric>That the linear regression isn't really.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10752-0
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:51.943
<v Hou, Eric>Good enough to to explain these complex
world. For example, the stock return,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10752-1
01:38:51.943 --> 01:38:53.589
<v Hou, Eric>we talk about the the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10759-0
01:38:54.259 --> 01:38:56.939
<v Hou, Eric>The Eugen Farmam and French model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10776-0
01:38:58.509 --> 01:39:02.216
<v Hou, Eric>Either the the,
the Cam model or three factor model or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10776-1
01:39:02.216 --> 01:39:05.789
<v Hou, Eric>five factor model they are.
Try trying to use those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10808-0
01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:14.595
<v Hou, Eric>Momentum information to explain the the
returns and as you can see and then we</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10808-1
01:39:14.595 --> 01:39:19.866
<v Hou, Eric>will tested the using MVDR Tesla stock
return daily return data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10808-2
01:39:19.866 --> 01:39:23.029
<v Hou, Eric>We we we know that accuracy isn't high.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10830-0
01:39:24.179 --> 01:39:29.615
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I I don't think anyone is
really using those fact factor model or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10830-1
01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:34.979
<v Hou, Eric>three factor model to to make their
investment decision. I don't think so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10838-0
01:39:35.299 --> 01:39:38.219
<v Hou, Eric>I think they can just use that as a
benchmark, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10855-0
01:39:38.219 --> 01:39:43.889
<v Hou, Eric>So then it can definitely explain some of
the variability of the the returns from</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10855-1
01:39:43.889 --> 01:39:47.139
<v Hou, Eric>the target stock,
but it cannot fully reflect.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10873-0
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:53.388
<v Hou, Eric>Those so you know when we purchase a
house and car, how you price those,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10873-1
01:39:53.388 --> 01:39:56.149
<v Hou, Eric>it is definitely not linear either, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10875-0
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.669
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10883-0
01:39:57.299 --> 01:40:00.619
<v Hou, Eric>You know, considering house,
you have so many factors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10886-0
01:40:01.499 --> 01:40:03.259
<v Hou, Eric>You know the location of the house.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10891-0
01:40:04.829 --> 01:40:06.029
<v Hou, Eric>And the size of the house.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10911-0
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:12.869
<v Hou, Eric>And then the real real estate real estate
tax rate of the of the House, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10917-0
01:40:12.869 --> 01:40:15.509
<v Hou, Eric>So then the year of the House,
there's so many.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10930-0
01:40:15.949 --> 01:40:20.476
<v Hou, Eric>So many factors we need to consider in
the neighborhood of the House. A car,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10930-1
01:40:20.476 --> 01:40:20.829
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10947-0
01:40:20.829 --> 01:40:25.259
<v Hou, Eric>So then you want to consider the brand of
the car, the mileage of the car,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10947-1
01:40:25.259 --> 01:40:27.149
<v Hou, Eric>and different different factors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10956-0
01:40:27.459 --> 01:40:30.019
<v Hou, Eric>So I those are really not linear.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10963-0
01:40:30.459 --> 01:40:32.659
<v Hou, Eric>And not to mention, there's option prize,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10970-0
01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:36.899
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you guys learn from the the
classic finance model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10986-0
01:40:38.469 --> 01:40:43.269
<v Hou, Eric>How you price the option is really you
have to use a binary tree, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/10993-0
01:40:43.269 --> 01:40:47.669
<v Hou, Eric>And then you make the assumption that
there is no arbitrage between.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11007-0
01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:56.386
<v Hou, Eric>Your your call option put option versus.
Now you can use it by sell those stocks</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11007-1
01:40:56.386 --> 01:40:58.309
<v Hou, Eric>and then there's some.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11014-0
01:41:00.819 --> 01:41:03.219
<v Hou, Eric>Low no risk investment you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11029-0
01:41:03.219 --> 01:41:07.871
<v Hou, Eric>You can create a similar situation as as
the as the option that you you do not</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11029-1
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:09.579
<v Hou, Eric>want to create any arbitrage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11054-0
01:41:10.059 --> 01:41:14.990
<v Hou, Eric>And any upper trash possibility
associated with that option versus the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11054-1
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:19.365
<v Hou, Eric>the simulated the case, right?
So then so that option prize is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11054-2
01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:21.379
<v Hou, Eric>definitely non linear either.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11075-0
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:28.472
<v Hou, Eric>So the in the real world,
you you definitely there's a need of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11075-1
01:41:28.472 --> 01:41:29.909
<v Hou, Eric>nonlinear models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11089-0
01:41:30.749 --> 01:41:35.844
<v Hou, Eric>So now, now from now on,
we gonna enter the entire world of a long</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11089-1
01:41:35.844 --> 01:41:36.909
<v Hou, Eric>linear models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11104-0
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:42.909
<v Hou, Eric>So we we will talk about this km model,
the K nearest neighbor neighborhood model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11107-0
01:41:42.909 --> 01:41:45.589
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the easiest nonlinear model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11120-0
01:41:46.459 --> 01:41:49.779
<v Hou, Eric>And then last time we gonna touch base on
the tree model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11130-0
01:41:49.779 --> 01:41:53.413
<v Hou, Eric>It's a pretty natural concept and then
everyone is using tree model everyday</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11130-1
01:41:53.413 --> 01:41:53.979
<v Hou, Eric>pretty much.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11139-0
01:41:55.549 --> 01:41:58.989
<v Hou, Eric>But you know how we put those concept
into?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11155-0
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:05.153
<v Hou, Eric>Into codes and then we we can actually
model anything with that model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11155-1
01:42:05.153 --> 01:42:06.669
<v Hou, Eric>Is is a different story?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11164-0
01:42:08.099 --> 01:42:11.619
<v Hou, Eric>After the three model,
we will talk about neural network.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11173-0
01:42:11.619 --> 01:42:15.699
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's another concept,
because the neural network is also.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11178-0
01:42:17.269 --> 01:42:18.069
<v Hou, Eric>Nonlinear for sure.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11196-0
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:23.523
<v Hou, Eric>You're you're contacting different
neurons together and then and then to to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11196-1
01:42:23.523 --> 01:42:25.349
<v Hou, Eric>mimic what's happening in real life?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11205-0
01:42:25.989 --> 01:42:28.269
<v Hou, Eric>So now to mention a large language models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11222-0
01:42:28.269 --> 01:42:33.891
<v Hou, Eric>So it's based upon what information has
been given to the model and you're</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11222-1
01:42:33.891 --> 01:42:37.189
<v Hou, Eric>predicting you're predicting the next
word.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11256-0
01:42:37.739 --> 01:42:41.628
<v Hou, Eric>And hopefully in the next word making
sense and that is connecting to the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11256-1
01:42:41.628 --> 01:42:44.991
<v Hou, Eric>previous word you you're mentioning and
that word is also, umm,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11256-2
01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:47.619
<v Hou, Eric>connecting to the meanings of the
previous words.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11270-0
01:42:47.619 --> 01:42:52.019
<v Hou, Eric>So then this so newer network becomes
building bricks for the large language</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11270-1
01:42:52.019 --> 01:42:52.419
<v Hou, Eric>models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11273-0
01:42:52.419 --> 01:42:54.179
<v Hou, Eric>So the models getting more and more
complex.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11279-0
01:42:55.749 --> 01:42:58.389
<v Hou, Eric>And and definitely all nonlinear models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11291-0
01:43:00.099 --> 01:43:03.090
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then let's start with something simple</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11291-1
01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:04.739
<v Hou, Eric>the the K nearest neighbor.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11294-0
01:43:05.539 --> 01:43:07.219
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a really simple model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11298-0
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.829
<v Hou, Eric>The method.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11305-0
01:43:09.829 --> 01:43:14.309
<v Hou, Eric>The idea is quite quite simple as well.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11315-0
01:43:14.869 --> 01:43:19.349
<v Hou, Eric>It's really like you have so many data
and then I can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11332-0
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:24.932
<v Hou, Eric>I can see I can visualize the data that
is definitely not following a linear</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11332-1
01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:25.429
<v Hou, Eric>pattern.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11341-0
01:43:25.949 --> 01:43:29.709
<v Hou, Eric>So then what I'm doing is I I I define.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11349-0
01:43:31.399 --> 01:43:34.799
<v Hou, Eric>I I stand at the one point I define who
are my neighbors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11360-0
01:43:35.359 --> 01:43:39.279
<v Hou, Eric>I can calculate averages of my neighbors
as a representative of the neighborhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11366-0
01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:43.399
<v Hou, Eric>Just sort of like you,
you're you're trying to learn.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11373-0
01:43:44.949 --> 01:43:46.189
<v Hou, Eric>You know the house price, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11399-0
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:50.759
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you can take the sample of
one neighborhood and average them,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11399-1
01:43:50.759 --> 01:43:55.082
<v Hou, Eric>and then you can call it set really a
representative price of another</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11399-2
01:43:55.082 --> 01:43:58.109
<v Hou, Eric>neighborhood and you go to another
neighborhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11405-0
01:43:58.109 --> 01:44:00.549
<v Hou, Eric>You, you, you, you use the public data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11413-0
01:44:00.549 --> 01:44:04.189
<v Hou, Eric>You can sample different houses and and
calculate average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11415-0
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.709
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11436-0
01:44:05.299 --> 01:44:08.224
<v Hou, Eric>A representative prize of that
neighborhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11436-1
01:44:08.224 --> 01:44:13.034
<v Hou, Eric>And then you collect more and more
average of a different neighborhood in</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11436-2
01:44:13.034 --> 01:44:13.619
<v Hou, Eric>one area.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11449-0
01:44:13.939 --> 01:44:17.853
<v Hou, Eric>So then you average them and then you can
call another representative price of the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11449-1
01:44:17.853 --> 01:44:18.419
<v Hou, Eric>entire area.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11466-0
01:44:18.739 --> 01:44:23.048
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is sort of the average and
average kind of idea is basically the K</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11466-1
01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:24.179
<v Hou, Eric>nearest neighborhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11482-0
01:44:25.749 --> 01:44:31.749
<v Hou, Eric>And and the K is. So for example using.
Still using that house price example.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11491-0
01:44:33.389 --> 01:44:36.749
<v Hou, Eric>In one neighborhood,
you can say you have a 10 houses.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11495-0
01:44:36.749 --> 01:44:37.869
<v Hou, Eric>In that neighborhood, you can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11498-0
01:44:37.869 --> 01:44:40.349
<v Hou, Eric>You can calculate average alpha entire.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11500-0
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.909
<v Hou, Eric>10 houses.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11508-0
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:46.269
<v Hou, Eric>So in that case the K equal to 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11540-0
01:44:48.049 --> 01:44:52.587
<v Hou, Eric>Or or you just want to know you know,
the Milwaukee area,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11540-1
01:44:52.587 --> 01:44:58.376
<v Hou, Eric>Milwaukee area price and then buy
different district. And you can say OK,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11540-2
01:44:58.376 --> 01:45:00.489
<v Hou, Eric>let me just use can as 100.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11543-0
01:45:00.489 --> 01:45:01.729
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11550-0
01:45:02.169 --> 01:45:05.049
<v Hou, Eric>I have a average price of one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11566-0
01:45:05.409 --> 01:45:10.587
<v Hou, Eric>I have a average price in the
neighborhood of a market university and a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11566-1
01:45:10.587 --> 01:45:12.529
<v Hou, Eric>UWM and downtown Milwaukee.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11570-0
01:45:12.529 --> 01:45:13.689
<v Hou, Eric>So I have a different prices.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11579-0
01:45:14.469 --> 01:45:16.709
<v Hou, Eric>In that case,
The Cave is definitely more than 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11585-0
01:45:16.989 --> 01:45:19.229
<v Hou, Eric>It could be 100 and could be actually.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11590-0
01:45:19.819 --> 01:45:20.579
<v Hou, Eric>More than 100.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11595-0
01:45:20.579 --> 01:45:22.579
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is based upon your purpose,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11601-0
01:45:22.579 --> 01:45:24.659
<v Hou, Eric>So then and how big your data is?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11605-0
01:45:24.779 --> 01:45:25.979
<v Hou, Eric>So then you define 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11607-0
01:45:25.979 --> 01:45:26.619
<v Hou, Eric>So they can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11615-0
01:45:27.419 --> 01:45:29.939
<v Hou, Eric>The 10 is actually one parameter.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11629-0
01:45:29.939 --> 01:45:34.985
<v Hou, Eric>We just talk about so the can can be
really big and 10 and 10 can be really</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11629-1
01:45:34.985 --> 01:45:36.579
<v Hou, Eric>small and can be big as.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11648-0
01:45:37.279 --> 01:45:41.554
<v Hou, Eric>You know the sample size and then you
have only one number and they can be half</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11648-1
01:45:41.554 --> 01:45:44.279
<v Hou, Eric>of a sample size and you actually have a
2 number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11674-0
01:45:44.279 --> 01:45:48.788
<v Hou, Eric>One is 1 representing,
you know the high values of, for example,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11674-1
01:45:48.788 --> 01:45:54.269
<v Hou, Eric>the houses another one is representing
the the the lower half of the houses in</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11674-2
01:45:54.269 --> 01:45:56.559
<v Hou, Eric>your sample. In your sample pool.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11678-0
01:45:56.559 --> 01:45:58.639
<v Hou, Eric>So so K is a parameter.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11685-0
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:02.229
<v Hou, Eric>That now we can experiment different case.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11693-0
01:46:05.699 --> 01:46:06.699
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite simple.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11694-0
01:46:06.699 --> 01:46:08.059
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite intuitive, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11701-0
01:46:08.059 --> 01:46:12.139
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you actually can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11716-0
01:46:12.259 --> 01:46:15.695
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have to make any assumption of
the data is following the normal</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11716-1
01:46:15.695 --> 01:46:16.299
<v Hou, Eric>distribution.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11736-0
01:46:16.299 --> 01:46:20.185
<v Hou, Eric>Data is following whatever distribution.
It doesn't really matter because the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11736-1
01:46:20.185 --> 01:46:23.872
<v Hou, Eric>purpose of this model is not analyzing
the the distribution of your data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11736-2
01:46:23.872 --> 01:46:24.819
<v Hou, Eric>It's easy relevant.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11747-0
01:46:26.429 --> 01:46:31.349
<v Hou, Eric>And any data is sometime working
perfectly with a nonlinear relationships.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11761-0
01:46:33.029 --> 01:46:38.709
<v Hou, Eric>So those are really the pros of this K
nearest neighbor model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11768-0
01:46:39.999 --> 01:46:43.559
<v Hou, Eric>However,
as you can imagine that you have to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11780-0
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:48.904
<v Hou, Eric>Give a,
give a initial value of K as a starting</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11780-1
01:46:48.904 --> 01:46:49.309
<v Hou, Eric>point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11795-0
01:46:51.069 --> 01:46:54.109
<v Hou, Eric>Where you know,
sometimes you have no idea what the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11795-1
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.869
<v Hou, Eric>proper K say.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11820-0
01:46:55.949 --> 01:47:01.696
<v Hou, Eric>Your you're you're asked to calculate
average price of Milwaukee and and that K</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11820-1
01:47:01.696 --> 01:47:06.509
<v Hou, Eric>could be as big as you know a million.
It could be as small as 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11822-0
01:47:06.749 --> 01:47:08.589
<v Hou, Eric>But if you chose to use 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11841-0
01:47:10.269 --> 01:47:13.080
<v Hou, Eric>You know, you know the number of a house,
you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11841-1
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.269
<v Hou, Eric>household here in Milwaukee and divide by
the your sample.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11857-0
01:47:16.539 --> 01:47:20.821
<v Hou, Eric>And then you have to calculate so many
numbers and then it could be</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11857-1
01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:22.459
<v Hou, Eric>computationally expensive.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11897-0
01:47:24.029 --> 01:47:29.095
<v Hou, Eric>For Milwaukee and then you use that
number K at K equals to 10 to calculate,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11897-1
01:47:29.095 --> 01:47:32.451
<v Hou, Eric>you know,
Chicago or San Francisco and and and you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11897-2
01:47:32.451 --> 01:47:37.978
<v Hou, Eric>you definitely need to calculate you know
10 times more so then you you are you are</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11897-3
01:47:37.978 --> 01:47:40.149
<v Hou, Eric>you are spending a lot of effort.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11909-0
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:46.029
<v Hou, Eric>On that and then it could be really
expensive. Mean for large data set.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11927-0
01:47:47.259 --> 01:47:50.189
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
and and definitely we will show you that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11927-1
01:47:50.189 --> 01:47:53.182
<v Hou, Eric>Umm,
sometimes you choose a bigger bigger K or</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11927-2
01:47:53.182 --> 01:47:53.819
<v Hou, Eric>smaller K.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11951-0
01:47:55.099 --> 01:48:00.356
<v Hou, Eric>You you're introducing a lot of bias to
your result and then not necessarily</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11951-1
01:48:00.356 --> 01:48:03.019
<v Hou, Eric>bigger K or smaller K are are are good.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11954-0
01:48:03.459 --> 01:48:07.059
<v Hou, Eric>But the question being what K?
Should I even be choosing?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11960-0
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:10.829
<v Hou, Eric>Unfortunately for this K and a model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11963-0
01:48:13.799 --> 01:48:14.359
<v Hou, Eric>We were.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11969-0
01:48:14.359 --> 01:48:15.999
<v Hou, Eric>We were talking about science.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/11970-0
01:48:15.999 --> 01:48:16.799
<v Hou, Eric>Now you know you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12001-0
01:48:16.799 --> 01:48:22.951
<v Hou, Eric>We've tried to quantify a lot of pros and
cons and a lot of a model and how model</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12001-1
01:48:22.951 --> 01:48:28.803
<v Hou, Eric>is is using to group the data and the
model data and choosing the K is really</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12001-2
01:48:28.803 --> 01:48:31.879
<v Hou, Eric>the art piece of the scientific approach.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12017-0
01:48:33.429 --> 01:48:36.629
<v Hou, Eric>You have to tell what is the best K for
you, unfortunately.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12029-0
01:48:36.829 --> 01:48:39.960
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you know,
not a lot of people really like this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12029-1
01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.270
<v Hou, Eric>K&amp;
N model because sometimes it could be</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12029-2
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.629
<v Hou, Eric>easily.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12073-0
01:48:43.939 --> 01:48:48.366
<v Hou, Eric>Overfeeding your data and then give you a
really high accurate model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12073-1
01:48:48.366 --> 01:48:53.552
<v Hou, Eric>but you know out of sample it may not be
great just because someone choose to use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12073-2
01:48:53.552 --> 01:48:58.485
<v Hou, Eric>a very smaller K the the K model can
explain a lot of nonlinear relationships</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12073-3
01:48:58.485 --> 01:49:00.699
<v Hou, Eric>and it's actually a starting point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12094-0
01:49:00.739 --> 01:49:04.289
<v Hou, Eric>Of the tree model and then people learn a
lot a ton from the K NN.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12094-1
01:49:04.289 --> 01:49:07.204
<v Hou, Eric>That's why people wanted the tree model
based upon it,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12094-2
01:49:07.204 --> 01:49:09.059
<v Hou, Eric>not necessarily based upon it, but.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12097-0
01:49:09.829 --> 01:49:10.709
<v Hou, Eric>They learn a lot of things.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12115-0
01:49:12.219 --> 01:49:18.974
<v Hou, Eric>But the drawback of the con of this one
is is is totally obvious that you can</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12115-1
01:49:18.974 --> 01:49:22.179
<v Hou, Eric>easily over fit it and then the K is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12123-0
01:49:23.359 --> 01:49:26.119
<v Hou, Eric>Is based upon a person's guess.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12128-0
01:49:27.279 --> 01:49:29.079
<v Hou, Eric>Like my preferred, your preference.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12135-0
01:49:29.559 --> 01:49:33.199
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's that's that's the cause
of these KN model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12138-0
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.429
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12140-0
01:49:35.429 --> 01:49:36.629
<v Hou, Eric>So we will.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12148-0
01:49:39.579 --> 01:49:42.739
<v Hou, Eric>We will use data to demonstrate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12156-0
01:49:44.309 --> 01:49:44.869
<v Hou, Eric>These this model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12160-0
01:49:44.869 --> 01:49:49.029
<v Hou, Eric>So now we we, we do have this used car.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12169-0
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:53.469
<v Hou, Eric>Prediction data set.
OK so then as I mentioned.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12194-0
01:49:55.229 --> 01:50:00.205
<v Hou, Eric>Predicting the use of car pricing will be
nonlinear first of all,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12194-1
01:50:00.205 --> 01:50:03.749
<v Hou, Eric>so in this data set we have so many
important.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12203-0
01:50:05.429 --> 01:50:08.229
<v Hou, Eric>Factors that could affect the the user
car.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12235-0
01:50:09.499 --> 01:50:15.103
<v Hou, Eric>The brand, the model for example,
like the brand could be really Toyota and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12235-1
01:50:15.103 --> 01:50:21.149
<v Hou, Eric>the model could be a camera or or Tesla
Model 3 and the model year and then which</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12235-2
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:24.099
<v Hou, Eric>in which year that model was introduced.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12245-0
01:50:24.299 --> 01:50:28.539
<v Hou, Eric>Now suppose the car was introduced in the
market as a new car. A mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12250-0
01:50:28.939 --> 01:50:29.699
<v Hou, Eric>So how?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12263-0
01:50:29.699 --> 01:50:32.689
<v Hou, Eric>How high?
The mileage the car is really on the the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12263-1
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:34.859
<v Hou, Eric>previous owner is running on his car.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12274-0
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:39.029
<v Hou, Eric>The fuel type,
this gasoline and the diesel is electric</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12274-1
01:50:39.029 --> 01:50:39.749
<v Hou, Eric>or hybruary.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12292-0
01:50:40.959 --> 01:50:43.913
<v Hou, Eric>Uh.
A different engine types and transmission.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12292-1
01:50:43.913 --> 01:50:48.439
<v Hou, Eric>The color of the car or any accident
history and the clean title price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12307-0
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:54.893
<v Hou, Eric>Well, for this K nm model,
we are not going to use all of those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12307-1
01:50:54.893 --> 01:50:56.309
<v Hou, Eric>All of those features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12330-0
01:50:58.469 --> 01:51:03.843
<v Hou, Eric>To to model the car, the used car price,
we are only going to use of one feature</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12330-1
01:51:03.843 --> 01:51:09.218
<v Hou, Eric>and then just to be really convenient we
are going to give you the one numerical</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12330-2
01:51:09.218 --> 01:51:09.749
<v Hou, Eric>feature.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12352-0
01:51:10.219 --> 01:51:16.886
<v Hou, Eric>So we're gonna use a mileage as as a as a
feature to to model the the relationship</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12352-1
01:51:16.886 --> 01:51:20.179
<v Hou, Eric>between the mileage and the price, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12356-0
01:51:21.749 --> 01:51:23.269
<v Hou, Eric>So intuitively.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12376-0
01:51:24.949 --> 01:51:29.145
<v Hou, Eric>How if I just eliminate all the factors,
only mileage enterprise and then then the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12376-1
01:51:29.145 --> 01:51:32.229
<v Hou, Eric>what's your expectation of how this
mileage affecting price?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12379-0
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:40.849
<v Benbenek, MATT>Probably effects it a lot.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12386-0
01:51:41.949 --> 01:51:43.749
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, it drives a lot.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12392-0
01:51:43.749 --> 01:51:46.189
<v Hou, Eric>And then you you expect in that price
will be lower, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12415-0
01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:54.082
<v Hou, Eric>So so if that's the case,
can we try to use what we have already</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12415-1
01:51:54.082 --> 01:51:59.199
<v Hou, Eric>learned its class to model this mileage
versus price relationship?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12422-0
01:52:00.279 --> 01:52:02.479
<v Hou, Eric>I guess the question the answer is yes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12425-0
01:52:02.479 --> 01:52:04.719
<v Hou, Eric>So let me let's try.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12437-0
01:52:05.439 --> 01:52:08.555
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see the data,
and then let's try to use a linear</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12437-1
01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.519
<v Hou, Eric>regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12442-0
01:52:09.519 --> 01:52:13.079
<v Hou, Eric>This is something we learned and
hopefully it works.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12459-0
01:52:13.949 --> 01:52:17.299
<v Hou, Eric>But you know,
since I'm introducing nonlinear model and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12459-1
01:52:17.299 --> 01:52:21.069
<v Hou, Eric>you know it's definitely not working,
but let's see why isn't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12467-0
01:52:22.679 --> 01:52:25.519
<v Hou, Eric>The linear regression model working right?
So then let's see that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12473-0
01:52:26.939 --> 01:52:32.059
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
let me just contact who is umm call space.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12476-0
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:36.429
<v Hou, Eric>Use the car.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12488-0
01:52:41.579 --> 01:52:47.819
<v Hou, Eric>So I download this data set user car from
cargo and then I'm loading this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12508-0
01:52:49.549 --> 01:52:53.364
<v Hou, Eric>So you see the model, you see the brand,
you see the model year,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12508-1
01:52:53.364 --> 01:52:55.829
<v Hou, Eric>you see the fuel time, you see the engine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12516-0
01:52:55.829 --> 01:52:58.469
<v Hou, Eric>There are so many information out here,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12541-0
01:52:58.469 --> 01:53:01.853
<v Hou, Eric>So then later on,
once we learn tree model or different</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12541-1
01:53:01.853 --> 01:53:04.694
<v Hou, Eric>model.
So we hopefully we eventually gonna use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12541-2
01:53:04.694 --> 01:53:09.469
<v Hou, Eric>all the features that support enterprise,
but this time we just useer mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12553-0
01:53:12.259 --> 01:53:17.339
<v Hou, Eric>And you definitely need to do a lot of
things that are called data cleansing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12555-0
01:53:18.869 --> 01:53:19.189
<v Hou, Eric>Using this data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12584-0
01:53:20.379 --> 01:53:23.429
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
while I'm loading this data,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12584-1
01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:28.850
<v Hou, Eric>it's definitely not umm workable for any
model we're gonna run based on how the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12584-2
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:33.256
<v Hou, Eric>data first of all, uh,
you can see you use this D type function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12584-3
01:53:33.256 --> 01:53:35.899
<v Hou, Eric>You can see the type of those features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12605-0
01:53:37.159 --> 01:53:44.052
<v Hou, Eric>Object, meaning they're not even a number,
meaning meaning the data is considering</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12605-1
01:53:44.052 --> 01:53:49.119
<v Hou, Eric>those as uh as strings as letters,
as as as characteristics.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12607-0
01:53:50.659 --> 01:53:51.179
<v Hou, Eric>Features.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12622-0
01:53:52.779 --> 01:53:57.999
<v Hou, Eric>For brand, it definitely makes sense,
but for mileage I mean you want to use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12622-1
01:53:57.999 --> 01:53:59.219
<v Hou, Eric>them as numerical.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12627-0
01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.979
<v Hou, Eric>So then, however, the number they input.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12638-0
01:54:03.739 --> 01:54:08.219
<v Hou, Eric>In these columns are 51 comma, 000 space.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12647-0
01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:11.889
<v Hou, Eric>Mi dot so mi means miles, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12649-0
01:54:11.889 --> 01:54:13.849
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12655-0
01:54:14.249 --> 01:54:17.089
<v Hou, Eric>Extract this number from this value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12664-0
01:54:18.659 --> 01:54:20.179
<v Hou, Eric>So this is something you need to do.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12667-0
01:54:20.179 --> 01:54:22.739
<v Hou, Eric>As for the data cleansing piece.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12693-0
01:54:24.419 --> 01:54:29.845
<v Hou, Eric>And also since we are using use mileage
and then you need to change the spelling</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12693-1
01:54:29.845 --> 01:54:32.859
<v Hou, Eric>of this column,
I don't this MILAG is right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12708-0
01:54:33.379 --> 01:54:38.819
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you know I I I look up the
dictionaries and feel like MILEAGE.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12713-0
01:54:38.819 --> 01:54:41.939
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's use that and those are the
price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12731-0
01:54:43.579 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Hou, Eric>You may consider this as you know the
actual price,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12731-1
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:49.179
<v Hou, Eric>but you know this is actually another
string.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12753-0
01:54:49.809 --> 01:54:55.104
<v Hou, Eric>So then the model does not like the
dollar sign and also the comma in those</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12753-1
01:54:55.104 --> 01:54:56.289
<v Hou, Eric>in those numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12763-0
01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:59.889
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to extract the number
from this actual price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12774-0
01:55:00.569 --> 01:55:06.769
<v Hou, Eric>So so this is a piece of the data
cleansing. Now we need to do so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12788-0
01:55:06.969 --> 01:55:13.179
<v Hou, Eric>We are going to extract my leg mileage
numbers and the price numbers from the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12788-1
01:55:13.179 --> 01:55:15.169
<v Hou, Eric>original column, so this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12805-0
01:55:16.299 --> 01:55:20.059
<v Hou, Eric>Str is tracked, so that's how we use it.
And then also we are explaining.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12814-0
01:55:20.489 --> 01:55:23.889
<v Hou, Eric>We are replacing those common with with
nothing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12835-0
01:55:23.889 --> 01:55:29.115
<v Hou, Eric>So now you just get rid of those comma in
those numbers and then eventually we</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12835-1
01:55:29.115 --> 01:55:32.489
<v Hou, Eric>convert that those extracted numbers into
a float.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12848-0
01:55:32.489 --> 01:55:35.891
<v Hou, Eric>Float means the float numbers not whole
number,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12848-1
01:55:35.891 --> 01:55:39.009
<v Hou, Eric>so we're allowing some partial of a
dollar.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12852-0
01:55:39.609 --> 01:55:42.849
<v Hou, Eric>So then we're doing that and then?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12859-0
01:55:44.419 --> 01:55:46.259
<v Hou, Eric>I did see some anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12862-0
01:55:48.179 --> 01:55:48.859
<v Hou, Eric>For like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12865-0
01:55:51.019 --> 01:55:52.059
<v Hou, Eric>For cars.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12878-0
01:55:53.659 --> 01:55:59.019
<v Hou, Eric>Bigger than 300,000 miles, or Harbi,
or like 250,000 miles.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12894-0
01:55:59.649 --> 01:56:07.070
<v Hou, Eric>So now I just get rid of those anomalies
or any cars that with the price less than</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12894-1
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.249
<v Hou, Eric>0.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12902-0
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:08.849
<v Hou, Eric>Or or the mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12905-0
01:56:08.929 --> 01:56:09.849
<v Hou, Eric>Uh less than 0.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12906-0
01:56:09.849 --> 01:56:10.249
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12911-0
01:56:10.249 --> 01:56:12.369
<v Hou, Eric>Those are, uh, realistic examples.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12955-0
01:56:12.369 --> 01:56:15.956
<v Hou, Eric>And then I just got rid of those
anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12955-1
01:56:15.956 --> 01:56:21.583
<v Hou, Eric>And then after after this anomaly removal
and then I still have, uh,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12955-2
01:56:21.583 --> 01:56:27.535
<v Hou, Eric>3966 year olds and and after changing
those columns I currently have the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12955-3
01:56:27.535 --> 01:56:31.449
<v Hou, Eric>mileage number which is a number and the
price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12963-0
01:56:31.449 --> 01:56:33.249
<v Hou, Eric>Number is just also number that you know.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12970-0
01:56:34.059 --> 01:56:35.899
<v Hou, Eric>Our model will will prefer those numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12994-0
01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:42.092
<v Hou, Eric>And then as you can see from this one,
you can directly see compare this 51,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/12994-1
01:56:42.092 --> 01:56:43.849
<v Hou, Eric>000 is a 51,000 miles, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13010-0
01:56:44.089 --> 01:56:48.881
<v Hou, Eric>We extract the correct number and then
this is $10,300 and this 10,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13010-1
01:56:48.881 --> 01:56:50.009
<v Hou, Eric>300 as a number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13019-0
01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:54.369
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just extract those numbers
correctly, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13022-0
01:56:55.249 --> 01:56:56.649
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just sketch.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13039-0
01:56:58.419 --> 01:57:01.949
<v Hou, Eric>Sketch our plot and then as you can see,
this is how the prize mileages are</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13039-1
01:57:01.949 --> 01:57:02.739
<v Hou, Eric>working together.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13046-0
01:57:02.939 --> 01:57:05.699
<v Hou, Eric>The X axis is the mileage and the Y axis
is the price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13059-0
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:16.629
<v Hou, Eric>So I didn't get rid of those used cars.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13068-0
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:21.629
<v Hou, Eric>That was $300,000 with a minimum mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13074-0
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:23.229
<v Hou, Eric>I have no idea what those cars are.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13083-0
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:27.949
<v Hou, Eric>And then you guys can dig more if you're
interested in that. But you know from.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13091-0
01:57:29.499 --> 01:57:33.339
<v Hou, Eric>From this graph,
it feels like it's not linear.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13104-0
01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:37.849
<v Hou, Eric>The reason it feels like is is the
relationship is like this like like a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13104-1
01:57:37.849 --> 01:57:39.019
<v Hou, Eric>like a log function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13117-0
01:57:39.569 --> 01:57:41.809
<v Hou, Eric>Or or or exponential function per
southeast.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13122-0
01:57:41.809 --> 01:57:44.049
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely not like linear function.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13127-0
01:57:44.249 --> 01:57:46.369
<v Hou, Eric>So the question for you guys right now,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13129-0
01:57:46.369 --> 01:57:47.249
<v Hou, Eric>So then if.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13135-0
01:57:48.899 --> 01:57:51.779
<v Hou, Eric>If I do want to fit this data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13139-0
01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:54.579
<v Hou, Eric>Into a linear regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13154-0
01:57:56.259 --> 01:58:02.179
<v Hou, Eric>What's your prediction of how that linear
regression will perform and why is bad?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13158-0
01:58:08.309 --> 01:58:09.509
<v Hou, Eric>We know it. It won't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13183-0
01:58:09.509 --> 01:58:13.570
<v Hou, Eric>It won't be a great model,
but but the question is before you you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13183-1
01:58:13.570 --> 01:58:18.678
<v Hou, Eric>try what's your prediction of of how that
linear regression model will perform and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13183-2
01:58:18.678 --> 01:58:20.709
<v Hou, Eric>why it's bad and this is a chart.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13191-0
01:58:28.919 --> 01:58:30.879
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I would say the model wouldn't.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13209-0
01:58:30.879 --> 01:58:38.319
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Wouldn't be as accurate as we like it to
be because you see prices after 150,000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13217-0
01:58:38.319 --> 01:58:40.639
<v Haroon, Sufyan>There is a lot of outliers there.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13216-0
01:58:41.269 --> 01:58:41.389
<v Hou, Eric>Hmm.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13237-0
01:58:41.639 --> 01:58:47.488
<v Haroon, Sufyan>There's a bunch of data set between zero
and hundred close to 100,000,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13237-1
01:58:47.488 --> 01:58:49.959
<v Haroon, Sufyan>along with on the mileage end.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13244-0
01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:54.599
<v Haroon, Sufyan>You you get you have more data points
between 0 and.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13253-0
01:58:55.379 --> 01:58:59.179
<v Haroon, Sufyan>150,000 and the rest I would say what?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13258-0
01:59:01.139 --> 01:59:02.939
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Make the model less accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13268-0
01:59:05.079 --> 01:59:06.773
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
the model is definitely less accurate,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13268-1
01:59:06.773 --> 01:59:06.999
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13270-0
01:59:06.999 --> 01:59:09.799
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's totally and that's totally
true.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13273-0
01:59:11.339 --> 01:59:12.499
<v Hou, Eric>And and and.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13279-0
01:59:15.139 --> 01:59:16.659
<v Hou, Eric>The question is right so.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13286-0
01:59:20.499 --> 01:59:22.299
<v Hou, Eric>So that you know part of a linear model,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13292-0
01:59:22.299 --> 01:59:23.619
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13295-0
01:59:23.619 --> 01:59:25.459
<v Hou, Eric>You sort of have two points.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13309-0
01:59:25.729 --> 01:59:29.529
<v Hou, Eric>On this chart on on this plane,
you can just sort of like draw a line.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13315-0
01:59:29.809 --> 01:59:31.969
<v Hou, Eric>That's how the linear model works, right?
So then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13317-0
01:59:33.819 --> 01:59:34.379
<v Hou, Eric>Let me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13320-0
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:37.129
<v Hou, Eric>Take a picture of.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13327-0
01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:41.259
<v Hou, Eric>It OK, I took the picture of it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13328-0
01:59:41.739 --> 01:59:42.619
<v Hou, Eric>A picture of it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13332-0
01:59:44.419 --> 01:59:45.579
<v Hou, Eric>Let's go to the slide.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13334-0
01:59:51.199 --> 01:59:51.479
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13336-0
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.989
<v Hou, Eric>I love this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13340-0
01:59:58.539 --> 01:59:59.379
<v Hou, Eric>Paste the picture.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13347-0
02:00:00.939 --> 02:00:02.219
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then this is our data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13355-0
02:00:04.859 --> 02:00:07.379
<v Hou, Eric>We can easily find a line here on Excel.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13366-0
02:00:09.179 --> 02:00:13.219
<v Hou, Eric>I'll just change the color of the color
color of it to be red.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13377-0
02:00:14.859 --> 02:00:18.299
<v Hou, Eric>And then change the way to be this OK,
boom, here we go.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13396-0
02:00:20.099 --> 02:00:26.091
<v Hou, Eric>The issue of this linear regression model
is we need to have a starting point and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13396-1
02:00:26.091 --> 02:00:27.699
<v Hou, Eric>then we do see, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13406-0
02:00:27.699 --> 02:00:31.859
<v Hou, Eric>So then the Intersect to the Y axis,
we do see there's a lot of data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13409-0
02:00:33.799 --> 02:00:35.319
<v Hou, Eric>Where do we put?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13422-0
02:00:37.299 --> 02:00:39.779
<v Hou, Eric>This point do we put the point here or do
we put the point here?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13432-0
02:00:40.139 --> 02:00:46.416
<v Hou, Eric>How do you feel comfortable to put this
starting point of this line to this Y</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13432-1
02:00:46.416 --> 02:00:46.819
<v Hou, Eric>axis?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13441-0
02:00:48.659 --> 02:00:51.139
<v Hou, Eric>Or just choose somewhere,
let's say to choose in here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13456-0
02:00:52.859 --> 02:00:56.670
<v Hou, Eric>And looks good.
And then we we change this point,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13456-1
02:00:56.670 --> 02:00:58.499
<v Hou, Eric>let's say we do it here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13459-0
02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:01.699
<v Hou, Eric>Boom. We have the fit of this model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13461-0
02:01:03.769 --> 02:01:04.649
<v Hou, Eric>It's not terrible.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13467-0
02:01:06.179 --> 02:01:07.459
<v Hou, Eric>But what's the issue of this fit?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13483-0
02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:14.429
<v Hou, Eric>You can explain a lot of between the
mileage and enterprise, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13486-0
02:01:14.429 --> 02:01:15.469
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is not bad.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13491-0
02:01:15.949 --> 02:01:16.869
<v Hou, Eric>I understand. Haroon.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13496-0
02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:18.789
<v Hou, Eric>You're saying that's not accurate because
in.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13498-0
02:01:19.049 --> 02:01:20.169
<v Hou, Eric>Higher region here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13521-0
02:01:24.939 --> 02:01:30.244
<v Hou, Eric>Entire region here. Unexplained.
But let's pretend we you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13521-1
02:01:30.244 --> 02:01:36.379
<v Hou, Eric>if you do some way you you use some way
to to get rid of those anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13526-0
02:01:37.939 --> 02:01:39.139
<v Hou, Eric>It looks OK, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13531-0
02:01:40.819 --> 02:01:41.899
<v Hou, Eric>It looks OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13535-0
02:01:41.939 --> 02:01:43.819
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just download the end of the bit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13537-0
02:01:44.339 --> 02:01:46.179
<v Hou, Eric>It looks OK, not too bad.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13546-0
02:01:47.899 --> 02:01:50.259
<v Hou, Eric>And is there any issue associated with
this fit?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13558-0
02:02:07.089 --> 02:02:10.089
<v Benbenek, MATT>The the ones you blocked off aren't
anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13567-0
02:02:11.129 --> 02:02:13.569
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, that, that's that's what I said.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13571-0
02:02:13.569 --> 02:02:13.969
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just get rid of.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13577-0
02:02:13.969 --> 02:02:16.449
<v Hou, Eric>That's to pretend we get rid of those
anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13586-0
02:02:16.489 --> 02:02:19.049
<v Hou, Eric>Let's to pretend that we only have the
data here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13593-0
02:02:19.329 --> 02:02:24.529
<v Hou, Eric>We only have the data below this big
black box, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13604-0
02:02:24.529 --> 02:02:28.889
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's say we only have the data
under under this blue box.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13607-0
02:02:28.889 --> 02:02:32.329
<v Hou, Eric>Was this a good fit for you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13616-0
02:02:39.659 --> 02:02:42.059
<v Hou, Eric>Does it still look like a nonlinear model
for you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13632-0
02:02:52.529 --> 02:02:56.254
<v Hou, Eric>Or or. You know,
since we have a bunch of data in it,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13632-1
02:02:56.254 --> 02:02:59.289
<v Hou, Eric>sort of like concentrated around this
area.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13638-0
02:02:59.289 --> 02:03:02.569
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just put this line here and
then boom.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13640-0
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.629
<v Hou, Eric>Can do this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13646-0
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:11.949
<v Hou, Eric>And and then why is this model bad?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13650-0
02:03:15.179 --> 02:03:16.059
<v Severin, Noah>I would say that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13675-0
02:03:17.619 --> 02:03:21.485
<v Severin, Noah>The maximum price it's gonna predict is
just over 50,000,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13675-1
02:03:21.485 --> 02:03:27.019
<v Severin, Noah>and clearly there's a lot of data above
that. Even as you get up to 100,000 miles.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13666-0
02:03:21.789 --> 02:03:21.989
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13680-0
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:30.249
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So, you know in reality.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13706-0
02:03:30.249 --> 02:03:32.943
<v Hou, Eric>In reality,
you wouldn't see this line being feed</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13706-1
02:03:32.943 --> 02:03:37.361
<v Hou, Eric>like this way because the majority of the
data in here and then you you can judge</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13706-2
02:03:37.361 --> 02:03:38.169
<v Hou, Eric>from the color.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13712-0
02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:40.519
<v Hou, Eric>So then you will eventually have the fit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13719-0
02:03:40.519 --> 02:03:44.559
<v Hou, Eric>Looks like this somewhat like this OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13744-0
02:03:44.959 --> 02:03:47.944
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
because there are so many numbers here,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13744-1
02:03:47.944 --> 02:03:51.903
<v Hou, Eric>so then you want to minimize the distance
between those numbers,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13744-2
02:03:51.903 --> 02:03:54.279
<v Hou, Eric>those thoughts versus your fit in line.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13754-0
02:03:54.279 --> 02:03:56.479
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then you wouldn't have that line?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13760-0
02:03:56.599 --> 02:04:00.759
<v Hou, Eric>So you have this line here.
If you have this line as your model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13765-0
02:04:04.679 --> 02:04:07.679
<v Hou, Eric>Penn is irrational.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13770-0
02:04:09.209 --> 02:04:10.289
<v Hou, Eric>Bad thing will happen to your model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13776-0
02:04:32.259 --> 02:04:32.459
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13785-0
02:04:32.459 --> 02:04:36.259
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just extend this line a little bit
and then you see my point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13803-0
02:04:38.529 --> 02:04:43.468
<v Hou, Eric>So if you extend this line. OK,
so for any any data,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13803-1
02:04:43.468 --> 02:04:47.009
<v Hou, Eric>any mileage between the zero and here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13813-0
02:04:48.689 --> 02:04:50.089
<v Hou, Eric>You sort of have a predicted price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13823-0
02:04:50.329 --> 02:04:56.089
<v Hou, Eric>And what about any mileage beyond this
point on your X axis?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13824-0
02:04:56.609 --> 02:04:58.209
<v Hou, Eric>You have a negative value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13828-0
02:04:59.889 --> 02:05:01.729
<v Hou, Eric>Of your used car price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13830-0
02:05:03.279 --> 02:05:03.839
<v Hou, Eric>That is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13838-0
02:05:05.409 --> 02:05:08.849
<v Hou, Eric>The issue of this linear regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13840-0
02:05:10.819 --> 02:05:11.379
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13852-0
02:05:12.929 --> 02:05:15.329
<v Hou, Eric>Because you wouldn't offer like an active
value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13870-0
02:05:15.329 --> 02:05:19.189
<v Hou, Eric>Is there any like,
dealers offers like an active via meaning</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13870-1
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:23.049
<v Hou, Eric>like they're paying the customer to pick
up their used cars?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13875-0
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:24.689
<v Hou, Eric>I hope not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13879-0
02:05:24.689 --> 02:05:26.609
<v Hou, Eric>I didn't. I I do not know any.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13914-0
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:35.334
<v Hou, Eric>So the issue of this data is the data is
concentrated in this area and then you</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13914-1
02:05:35.334 --> 02:05:39.278
<v Hou, Eric>fit a linear model.
You have situations like this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13914-2
02:05:39.278 --> 02:05:42.989
<v Hou, Eric>I did do that and then I filled a linear
model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13921-0
02:05:43.029 --> 02:05:44.989
<v Hou, Eric>This is how the linear model look like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13925-0
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:46.989
<v Hou, Eric>I'll, I'll show you. I'm not lying.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13942-0
02:05:51.459 --> 02:05:54.354
<v Hou, Eric>I did try a linear regression model and
the model is showing OK,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13942-1
02:05:54.354 --> 02:05:55.779
<v Hou, Eric>so this is going to be my model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13957-0
02:05:57.329 --> 02:06:05.157
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly, with all those anomalies,
just take a look at the data under 100,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13957-1
02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:05.569
<v Hou, Eric>000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13968-0
02:06:07.249 --> 02:06:10.929
<v Hou, Eric>Before this, this line becomes negative.
It looks great.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13981-0
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:16.001
<v Hou, Eric>Honestly, it looks great. Great, great,
great fit, but just, you know,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13981-1
02:06:16.001 --> 02:06:20.051
<v Hou, Eric>beyond that you, your,
your this model going to give you an</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13981-2
02:06:20.051 --> 02:06:20.929
<v Hou, Eric>active value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13996-0
02:06:21.399 --> 02:06:26.708
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can do something like fill
in an average here so that you manually</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/13996-1
02:06:26.708 --> 02:06:27.239
<v Hou, Eric>make it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14017-0
02:06:28.809 --> 02:06:34.028
<v Hou, Eric>Nonlinear. That's something you can do,
but just saying this is linear regression</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14017-1
02:06:34.028 --> 02:06:36.129
<v Hou, Eric>line is not working for this one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14021-0
02:06:36.129 --> 02:06:37.729
<v Hou, Eric>For example, this is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14025-0
02:06:38.729 --> 02:06:40.249
<v Hou, Eric>This is the model equation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14034-0
02:06:40.249 --> 02:06:46.649
<v Hou, Eric>It's really $0.
40 mult by your mileage and plus $66,000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14045-0
02:06:48.729 --> 02:06:51.409
<v Hou, Eric>This is how the model is predicting your
used car.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14084-0
02:06:53.299 --> 02:07:01.865
<v Hou, Eric>Use the car price so you have to sort of
like you have your car running a A10</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14084-1
02:07:01.865 --> 02:07:09.113
<v Hou, Eric>thousand, 10,000 miles,
so then you're subtracting $4000 from the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14084-2
02:07:09.113 --> 02:07:11.419
<v Hou, Eric>66,000 initial price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14094-0
02:07:11.739 --> 02:07:15.459
<v Hou, Eric>So then that'll be 62,
000 depending on What Car you have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14097-0
02:07:15.899 --> 02:07:16.219
<v Hou, Eric>It's not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14098-0
02:07:16.219 --> 02:07:17.219
<v Hou, Eric>It's not bad, but.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14106-0
02:07:18.009 --> 02:07:20.969
<v Hou, Eric>If there's a mileage is really let's say.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14132-0
02:07:22.739 --> 02:07:25.649
<v Hou, Eric>200,
000 and then that core is become the that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14132-1
02:07:25.649 --> 02:07:29.302
<v Hou, Eric>core is become negative.
The price of that core has become</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14132-2
02:07:29.302 --> 02:07:29.859
<v Hou, Eric>negative.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14153-0
02:07:29.859 --> 02:07:35.698
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's that's why it's a terrible
model and not to mention to consider</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14153-1
02:07:35.698 --> 02:07:39.541
<v Hou, Eric>those points.
But I agree with you that those point</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14153-2
02:07:39.541 --> 02:07:43.459
<v Hou, Eric>works more likely as as anomalies than
actual point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14162-0
02:07:45.009 --> 02:07:48.129
<v Hou, Eric>And I believe the the other features,
for example brand.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14171-0
02:07:49.809 --> 02:07:52.289
<v Hou, Eric>Or models could be explaining those
anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14187-0
02:07:52.599 --> 02:07:57.479
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why different tree models could
be more advanced than this KNN.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14190-0
02:07:57.479 --> 02:07:58.359
<v Hou, Eric>Just use a mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14195-0
02:07:58.439 --> 02:07:59.839
<v Hou, Eric>Those are pure anomalies.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14205-0
02:08:01.409 --> 02:08:03.049
<v Hou, Eric>So let's try the KNN.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14209-0
02:08:03.289 --> 02:08:05.649
<v Hou, Eric>So what does KNN do is?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14216-0
02:08:07.489 --> 02:08:10.489
<v Hou, Eric>Just using this as an example is a pure
point.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14226-0
02:08:10.489 --> 02:08:15.569
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then for every single point,
you'll find the neighboring.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14239-0
02:08:17.369 --> 02:08:24.350
<v Hou, Eric>10 points and then your calculating the
average amount that neighborhood of 10</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14239-1
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.969
<v Hou, Eric>points.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14258-0
02:08:25.319 --> 02:08:32.432
<v Hou, Eric>That's just purely how the KNA is
calculated and for this class we we start</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14258-1
02:08:32.432 --> 02:08:34.959
<v Hou, Eric>with K equal K equal to 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14273-0
02:08:34.959 --> 02:08:42.991
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try that and how you actually train
this KNN model is you can just basically</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14273-1
02:08:42.991 --> 02:08:43.959
<v Hou, Eric>call this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14280-0
02:08:45.769 --> 02:08:48.689
<v Hou, Eric>This KNN regressor from SK learn.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14289-0
02:08:50.609 --> 02:08:53.113
<v Hou, Eric>Library.
So then you you can just definitely use</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14289-1
02:08:53.113 --> 02:08:53.369
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14292-0
02:08:55.369 --> 02:08:56.529
<v Hou, Eric>So for this one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14299-0
02:08:58.089 --> 02:09:00.249
<v Hou, Eric>I chose to use 10 neighbors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14328-0
02:09:01.929 --> 02:09:07.812
<v Hou, Eric>And then I just want to use 10 neighbors
and then run keep calculating the average</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14328-1
02:09:07.812 --> 02:09:11.569
<v Hou, Eric>of of 10 neighbors and then I'll see how
that works.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14345-0
02:09:11.649 --> 02:09:15.645
<v Hou, Eric>But whether or not that works better than
my linear regression model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14345-1
02:09:15.645 --> 02:09:17.929
<v Hou, Eric>so then I just plot it on the same data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14347-0
02:09:17.929 --> 02:09:19.089
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is how.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14354-0
02:09:20.849 --> 02:09:23.289
<v Hou, Eric>This can model eventually look like you
can.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14361-0
02:09:23.329 --> 02:09:26.169
<v Hou, Eric>Zoom in. You can have more up and downs,
right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14367-0
02:09:26.169 --> 02:09:27.889
<v Hou, Eric>So more up and downs, but it's how.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14387-0
02:09:28.399 --> 02:09:33.719
<v Hou, Eric>It is between different mileages.
So basically just for each mileage.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14398-0
02:09:33.959 --> 02:09:38.140
<v Hou, Eric>So you just pick like 10 values and
calculate the average and then that's how</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14398-1
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:39.159
<v Hou, Eric>you got this curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14403-0
02:09:40.519 --> 02:09:42.039
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think this curve is better than?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14408-0
02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:44.889
<v Hou, Eric>Than than a linear regression model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14410-0
02:09:50.509 --> 02:09:51.029
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14418-0
02:09:53.999 --> 02:09:54.879
<v Benbenek, MATT>Because it's not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14426-0
02:09:54.959 --> 02:09:57.079
<v Benbenek, MATT>It won't give you a negative price value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14428-0
02:09:56.769 --> 02:09:58.369
<v Hou, Eric>They won't give you an active ID or.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14448-0
02:10:00.369 --> 02:10:05.951
<v Hou, Eric>And as you can see, we yeah,
we believe those are anomalies and I</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14448-1
02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:09.249
<v Hou, Eric>believe those anomalies affected those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14473-0
02:10:10.809 --> 02:10:16.111
<v Hou, Eric>Values a lot and and at this point so not
just because on this vertical line there</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14473-1
02:10:16.111 --> 02:10:19.369
<v Hou, Eric>are some high values affecting this,
this one but.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14486-0
02:10:21.089 --> 02:10:24.169
<v Hou, Eric>Actually, you know,
at least there is no negative values when</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14486-1
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:25.809
<v Hou, Eric>your mileage becomes much bigger.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14493-0
02:10:27.569 --> 02:10:30.289
<v Hou, Eric>I try I I did a test.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14498-0
02:10:31.099 --> 02:10:32.739
<v Hou, Eric>So I chose OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14503-0
02:10:32.739 --> 02:10:34.059
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just rerun everything.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14509-0
02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:36.059
<v Hou, Eric>So then I actually run the code.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14516-0
02:10:42.829 --> 02:10:43.909
<v Hou, Eric>So I try OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14523-0
02:10:43.909 --> 02:10:48.789
<v Hou, Eric>What about my example? Is is 100,
000 miles?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14563-0
02:10:49.429 --> 02:10:55.534
<v Hou, Eric>So then 100,000 miles a linear prediction,
the linear model gonna give me. OK,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14563-1
02:10:55.534 --> 02:11:00.403
<v Hou, Eric>so the the car is 26,
000 and the KNN is it's is a 17,000. OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14563-2
02:11:00.403 --> 02:11:05.349
<v Hou, Eric>I I will feel like if I will buy a car I
will I will trust the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14569-0
02:11:05.349 --> 02:11:06.949
<v Hou, Eric>Knn because it's lower price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14584-0
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:13.729
<v Hou, Eric>But I definitely wouldn't pay like 26,
000 on the car that is 100,000 miles.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14591-0
02:11:14.039 --> 02:11:17.039
<v Hou, Eric>I guess so. I I feel is more accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14597-0
02:11:18.609 --> 02:11:20.409
<v Hou, Eric>And this is the way that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14614-0
02:11:22.049 --> 02:11:28.769
<v Hou, Eric>The actual data and how the the nearest
neighbors were were selected.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14617-0
02:11:28.929 --> 02:11:31.129
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully I can just enlarge it a little
bit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14624-0
02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:42.839
<v Hou, Eric>So for example, for that 50,000 miles.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14635-0
02:11:44.409 --> 02:11:48.809
<v Hou, Eric>This is how the model is selecting the
the neighbors.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14647-0
02:11:51.809 --> 02:11:55.913
<v Hou, Eric>For that, 50,
000 miles knows how the model selecting</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14647-1
02:11:55.913 --> 02:11:56.369
<v Hou, Eric>those.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14661-0
02:11:56.729 --> 02:12:02.993
<v Hou, Eric>So then the model is selecting those
points and calculated a calculated</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14661-1
02:12:02.993 --> 02:12:03.689
<v Hou, Eric>average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14663-0
02:12:03.689 --> 02:12:05.849
<v Hou, Eric>So that's how this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14683-0
02:12:06.639 --> 02:12:09.592
<v Hou, Eric>$32,
000 is calculated right and linear</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14683-1
02:12:09.592 --> 02:12:15.498
<v Hou, Eric>regression model is basically putting
this number to another three line to give</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14683-2
02:12:15.498 --> 02:12:16.679
<v Hou, Eric>you this 46,000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14729-0
02:12:18.249 --> 02:12:21.903
<v Hou, Eric>In my opinion,
this is sort of like how you buy a car</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14729-1
02:12:21.903 --> 02:12:25.286
<v Hou, Eric>and then you're saying, hey,
I'm gonna buy a car,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14729-2
02:12:25.286 --> 02:12:30.632
<v Hou, Eric>for example in makwan and then with some
size and then you're really pick some</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14729-3
02:12:30.632 --> 02:12:34.489
<v Hou, Eric>samples in and with a similar size and
then how you Cal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14734-0
02:12:34.489 --> 02:12:37.049
<v Hou, Eric>Average of that, that, that, that House.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14738-0
02:12:37.559 --> 02:12:39.159
<v Hou, Eric>And that is giving you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14761-0
02:12:40.729 --> 02:12:45.418
<v Hou, Eric>That sort of a mimic of how KNN is
working and and and and I think this is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14761-1
02:12:45.418 --> 02:12:49.731
<v Hou, Eric>making more sense than a linear
regression considering is not really</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14761-2
02:12:49.731 --> 02:12:50.169
<v Hou, Eric>linear.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14778-0
02:12:50.609 --> 02:12:55.652
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically a chart giving you
the details of how the K is calculating</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14778-1
02:12:55.652 --> 02:12:56.409
<v Hou, Eric>this number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14780-0
02:12:56.409 --> 02:12:58.249
<v Hou, Eric>Let me change it to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14786-0
02:13:00.289 --> 02:13:04.689
<v Hou, Eric>This 10,100 thousand right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14789-0
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:10.089
<v Hou, Eric>So it's picking more numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14792-0
02:13:11.769 --> 02:13:12.769
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know, no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14794-0
02:13:14.199 --> 02:13:14.679
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14800-0
02:13:16.409 --> 02:13:18.529
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, sorry. I think it's time.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14809-0
02:13:23.459 --> 02:13:27.459
<v Hou, Eric>Was it picking more numbers than I
thought it would be? OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14816-0
02:13:29.409 --> 02:13:31.809
<v Hou, Eric>I guess I need to change the codes.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14819-0
02:13:33.689 --> 02:13:36.409
<v Hou, Eric>Because I'm definitely marking more.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14821-0
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:38.169
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14831-0
02:13:41.489 --> 02:13:44.569
<v Hou, Eric>This is definitely not right,
but this is right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14835-0
02:13:44.639 --> 02:13:46.079
<v Hou, Eric>But the point is right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14838-0
02:13:46.079 --> 02:13:47.399
<v Hou, Eric>So now I need to change the calls.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14842-0
02:13:47.399 --> 02:13:50.239
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry about that. Move back to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14850-0
02:13:51.809 --> 02:13:53.569
<v Hou, Eric>Where does the K come?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14867-0
02:14:18.189 --> 02:14:21.549
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I need to change somewhere here. OK,
so sorry about that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14871-0
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:22.629
<v Hou, Eric>I'll change the calls.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14875-0
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:23.909
<v Hou, Eric>This is not accurate.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14879-0
02:14:23.909 --> 02:14:25.749
<v Hou, Eric>I'll change the calls and upload to the.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14881-0
02:14:28.809 --> 02:14:28.889
<v Hou, Eric>Ah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14884-0
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:31.749
<v Hou, Eric>To the other D2L.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14896-0
02:14:35.289 --> 02:14:40.569
<v Hou, Eric>But the question is so you can change
different case, right? So then?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14898-0
02:14:43.009 --> 02:14:43.249
<v Hou, Eric>Change it back.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14900-0
02:14:51.459 --> 02:14:51.859
<v Hou, Eric>On that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14903-0
02:14:54.959 --> 02:14:55.439
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14907-0
02:14:55.479 --> 02:14:56.719
<v Hou, Eric>It's not coming back, OK?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14908-0
02:14:56.719 --> 02:14:57.159
<v Hou, Eric>That's fine.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14917-0
02:14:58.969 --> 02:15:00.929
<v Hou, Eric>So let's go back to this curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14923-0
02:15:00.929 --> 02:15:04.689
<v Hou, Eric>So this curve is so that you're using K
to 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14933-0
02:15:06.329 --> 02:15:09.249
<v Hou, Eric>So question is yes K equal to 10.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14950-0
02:15:09.249 --> 02:15:16.344
<v Hou, Eric>We have this curve like this and then I
want to know should I change this K to be</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14950-1
02:15:16.344 --> 02:15:17.729
<v Hou, Eric>a bigger number?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14960-0
02:15:17.729 --> 02:15:19.769
<v Hou, Eric>Should I change the K to be a smaller
number?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14964-0
02:15:20.289 --> 02:15:22.569
<v Hou, Eric>So I did try this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14966-0
02:15:23.329 --> 02:15:25.729
<v Hou, Eric>So I tried K equals.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14979-0
02:15:26.079 --> 02:15:31.079
<v Hou, Eric>To two and five and 10110 a thousand 2000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14985-0
02:15:31.599 --> 02:15:33.119
<v Hou, Eric>So K equal to two.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/14990-0
02:15:33.479 --> 02:15:36.799
<v Hou, Eric>It looks like this K equal to 5.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15011-0
02:15:37.079 --> 02:15:43.489
<v Hou, Eric>It looks like this K equal to 10 like
this K equal to 1000 would like this</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15011-1
02:15:43.489 --> 02:15:47.079
<v Hou, Eric>curve and K equal to 2000 like this curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15022-0
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:52.729
<v Hou, Eric>What can you guys observe from the
different case?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15030-0
02:15:52.849 --> 02:15:56.149
<v Hou, Eric>And honestly,
I think I think I have those chart in my</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15030-1
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.569
<v Hou, Eric>slides.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15044-0
02:16:00.699 --> 02:16:07.659
<v Hou, Eric>So those are different case 2 and 10102
thousand.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15051-0
02:16:08.499 --> 02:16:13.339
<v Hou, Eric>So what can you observe from this red
regression?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15058-0
02:16:14.889 --> 02:16:15.889
<v Hou, Eric>Fit based upon different K.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15060-0
02:16:15.889 --> 02:16:17.889
<v Hou, Eric>What can you tell?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15064-0
02:16:38.069 --> 02:16:38.829
<v Hou, Eric>Any thought?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15081-0
02:16:51.069 --> 02:16:56.469
<v Severin, Noah>It looks like the higher K value you use,
the tighter the dispersion gets.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15083-0
02:16:56.829 --> 02:16:57.349
<v Severin, Noah>Excuse me.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15089-0
02:16:58.719 --> 02:17:01.039
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, or another one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15095-0
02:17:01.039 --> 02:17:03.759
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think that is smoother than this?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15101-0
02:17:04.269 --> 02:17:05.998
<v Severin, Noah>Yeah,
that's essentially what I was trying to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15101-1
02:17:05.998 --> 02:17:06.149
<v Severin, Noah>say.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15107-0
02:17:06.139 --> 02:17:07.459
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15111-0
02:17:07.459 --> 02:17:09.379
<v Hou, Eric>So definitely looks like a curve.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15117-0
02:17:09.379 --> 02:17:11.819
<v Hou, Eric>And this one looks like up or down like
stock price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15119-0
02:17:13.609 --> 02:17:14.249
<v Hou, Eric>But why is that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15125-0
02:17:17.169 --> 02:17:17.849
<v Hou, Eric>I agree with you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15128-0
02:17:17.849 --> 02:17:18.569
<v Hou, Eric>I agree with you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15132-0
02:17:18.569 --> 02:17:19.249
<v Hou, Eric>You know what I mean?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15136-0
02:17:19.329 --> 02:17:20.009
<v Hou, Eric>I agree with you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15148-0
02:17:20.009 --> 02:17:23.837
<v Hou, Eric>So then lower K you have a lot of up or
down,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15148-1
02:17:23.837 --> 02:17:28.249
<v Hou, Eric>but the hurricane is getting more and
more smoother.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15151-0
02:17:28.649 --> 02:17:29.529
<v Hou, Eric>So then why is that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15183-0
02:17:36.659 --> 02:17:40.036
<v Hou, Eric>And and maybe that that means you change
that,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15183-1
02:17:40.036 --> 02:17:45.714
<v Hou, Eric>change the question if I choose to use,
if I change the K to be all the points</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15183-2
02:17:45.714 --> 02:17:49.379
<v Hou, Eric>that you have,
what is that curve gonna look like?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15188-0
02:17:57.219 --> 02:17:59.379
<v Benbenek, MATT>This can be a line like the average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15193-0
02:18:02.359 --> 02:18:05.799
<v Hou, Eric>Use all the points that'll be.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15195-0
02:18:08.699 --> 02:18:08.979
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15198-0
02:18:11.999 --> 02:18:13.199
<v Hou, Eric>I'll be a line like this.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15208-0
02:18:20.229 --> 02:18:23.989
<v Hou, Eric>And what about if I use half of the K?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15212-0
02:18:23.989 --> 02:18:25.349
<v Hou, Eric>What does that line look like?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15237-0
02:18:30.509 --> 02:18:34.496
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry,
let me use 1/2 of the all of the of the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15237-1
02:18:34.496 --> 02:18:40.349
<v Hou, Eric>data that I have, the K equal to.
Let's say I have 4000 data points.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15240-0
02:18:40.349 --> 02:18:41.629
<v Hou, Eric>The K equal to 2000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15254-0
02:18:44.509 --> 02:18:46.327
<v Hou, Eric>How?
I mean the series of 2000 that will not</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15254-1
02:18:46.327 --> 02:18:48.549
<v Hou, Eric>look like that but but you know,
you know what I mean?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15270-0
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:51.829
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say the day that the sample size
is 10,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15270-1
02:18:51.829 --> 02:18:54.909
<v Hou, Eric>000 and then I choose to use K equal to
5000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15274-0
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:56.949
<v Hou, Eric>How does that curve and then look like?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15283-0
02:19:17.859 --> 02:19:19.699
<v Hou, Eric>I think hopefully they gonna look like.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15286-0
02:19:22.529 --> 02:19:23.489
<v Hou, Eric>I don't need icons.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15300-0
02:19:25.729 --> 02:19:30.489
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully not gonna look like. Oh hell,
I have entire half of the data set here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15302-0
02:19:35.739 --> 02:19:36.579
<v Hou, Eric>And.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15312-0
02:19:39.259 --> 02:19:42.259
<v Hou, Eric>And I have some data set here,
so then those are the averages, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15317-0
02:19:42.259 --> 02:19:45.299
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just have A to sort of.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15333-0
02:19:46.849 --> 02:19:51.129
<v Hou, Eric>Connecting them looks like a smoother
version of this, so that'll be my.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15340-0
02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:55.329
<v Hou, Eric>That'll be my curve,
so look closer like this one.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15348-0
02:19:56.879 --> 02:20:00.159
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you have a higher K.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15363-0
02:20:00.159 --> 02:20:05.392
<v Hou, Eric>You are using the majority data to
compute 1 number or two or or small</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15363-1
02:20:05.392 --> 02:20:06.719
<v Hou, Eric>amount of numbers.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15368-0
02:20:06.879 --> 02:20:10.159
<v Hou, Eric>That's why it looks smoother.
But what about?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15373-0
02:20:11.769 --> 02:20:13.409
<v Hou, Eric>I I then put another ring.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15380-0
02:20:13.449 --> 02:20:15.409
<v Hou, Eric>What about if I use K to one?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15384-0
02:20:15.409 --> 02:20:16.769
<v Hou, Eric>How does that curve gonna look like?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15390-0
02:20:28.639 --> 02:20:29.279
<v Hou, Eric>What does that?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15393-0
02:20:29.319 --> 02:20:30.839
<v Hou, Eric>What does K equal to 1 means?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15411-0
02:20:46.989 --> 02:20:49.921
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
Q1 it means like every single point is in</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15411-1
02:20:49.921 --> 02:20:51.069
<v Hou, Eric>its neighbourhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15424-0
02:20:51.069 --> 02:20:53.770
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're pretty much going to
calculate the average across all the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15424-1
02:20:53.770 --> 02:20:54.029
<v Hou, Eric>points.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15437-0
02:20:54.029 --> 02:20:58.869
<v Hou, Eric>So now be more volatile than this. OK too.
They're going to be up and down.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15445-0
02:20:58.869 --> 02:21:02.029
<v Hou, Eric>Down down, because every single point is,
is its neighborhood.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15459-0
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:09.349
<v Hou, Eric>So what we can summarize is the lower K,
the more volatility the higher K.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15466-0
02:21:11.489 --> 02:21:14.129
<v Hou, Eric>The more smoothness around those curves.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15476-0
02:21:15.549 --> 02:21:18.149
<v Hou, Eric>But, but that's not our goal, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15519-0
02:21:18.149 --> 02:21:23.111
<v Hou, Eric>Because our goal is not seeing like
visualize a curve and then the fits,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15519-1
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Hou, Eric>our goal is which model give us a better
results.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15519-2
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:31.949
<v Hou, Eric>The very better result mean like we can
we can have a closer gas of of the user</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15519-3
02:21:31.949 --> 02:21:32.629
<v Hou, Eric>car price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15522-0
02:21:33.589 --> 02:21:35.509
<v Hou, Eric>So then how to choose the best game?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15539-0
02:21:37.449 --> 02:21:40.639
<v Hou, Eric>Remember that we we we were talking about
the linear regression we talked about.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15539-1
02:21:40.639 --> 02:21:42.609
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
there's something that called accuracy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15542-0
02:21:42.609 --> 02:21:43.729
<v Hou, Eric>We need to use accuracy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15573-0
02:21:44.809 --> 02:21:50.433
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then let me just this,
we need to quantify the performance of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15573-1
02:21:50.433 --> 02:21:56.361
<v Hou, Eric>each model whatever KK you do, 1234.
So then so then we are we are saying hey</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15573-2
02:21:56.361 --> 02:21:58.489
<v Hou, Eric>that's let's use these RMSE.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15598-0
02:21:58.489 --> 02:22:03.249
<v Hou, Eric>So RMSE is the actual value.
The difference between your actual value</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15598-1
02:22:03.249 --> 02:22:08.689
<v Hou, Eric>and your prediction value and the square
it and sum it up and take the average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15600-0
02:22:08.689 --> 02:22:10.009
<v Hou, Eric>So that's a square root.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15607-0
02:22:10.809 --> 02:22:13.609
<v Hou, Eric>Of a mean squared error so then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15614-0
02:22:14.199 --> 02:22:18.039
<v Hou, Eric>We just use this one to quantify them the
model performance.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15641-0
02:22:19.689 --> 02:22:26.547
<v Hou, Eric>The good thing of this RMSE is that you
know you want to minimize it because when</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15641-1
02:22:26.547 --> 02:22:31.649
<v Hou, Eric>your prediction is getting closer to your
your actual value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15655-0
02:22:33.409 --> 02:22:36.150
<v Hou, Eric>This this number.
This difference becomes more and more</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15655-1
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.689
<v Hou, Eric>close to 0.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15656-0
02:22:37.289 --> 02:22:38.609
<v Hou, Eric>So then the square.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15672-0
02:22:40.449 --> 02:22:42.686
<v Hou, Eric>Is if if this number is a big between
zero and one,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15672-1
02:22:42.686 --> 02:22:45.009
<v Hou, Eric>the square is going to make this number
even smaller.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15685-0
02:22:46.019 --> 02:22:49.619
<v Hou, Eric>So then you hope you have these RMS as
small as possible.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15706-0
02:22:49.619 --> 02:22:53.754
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you want to minimize this,
but this one can be a value to to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15706-1
02:22:53.754 --> 02:22:58.003
<v Hou, Eric>quantify your performance of the models
and then you can use this value to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15706-2
02:22:58.003 --> 02:22:59.419
<v Hou, Eric>compare different models.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15709-0
02:23:00.969 --> 02:23:01.849
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's see.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15721-0
02:23:04.529 --> 02:23:08.169
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see what we can say is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15728-0
02:23:08.169 --> 02:23:13.129
<v Hou, Eric>When K decreases,
this is what I try I try.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15732-0
02:23:13.129 --> 02:23:15.929
<v Hou, Eric>I start from 1000 K equal to 1000.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15737-0
02:23:17.609 --> 02:23:19.769
<v Hou, Eric>And two K equal to two.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15746-0
02:23:20.729 --> 02:23:26.329
<v Hou, Eric>My Mr.
Massey RMSE start from this level and.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15760-0
02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:35.031
<v Hou, Eric>Consistently going down and you drop
significantly to some really low level</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15760-1
02:23:35.031 --> 02:23:35.689
<v Hou, Eric>number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15763-0
02:23:37.409 --> 02:23:39.489
<v Hou, Eric>And why is this?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15768-0
02:23:50.169 --> 02:23:53.289
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, is this as expected?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15773-0
02:24:27.579 --> 02:24:28.819
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15777-0
02:24:30.369 --> 02:24:31.889
<v Hou, Eric>We know that. See here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15781-0
02:24:33.929 --> 02:24:35.009
<v Hou, Eric>From the extreme.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15798-0
02:24:36.649 --> 02:24:41.631
<v Hou, Eric>We know if we choose to use K equal to
entire sample size,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15798-1
02:24:41.631 --> 02:24:44.249
<v Hou, Eric>meaning we only have one value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15807-0
02:24:46.049 --> 02:24:49.409
<v Hou, Eric>We're really compare entire data set
versus 1 number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15817-0
02:24:51.129 --> 02:24:55.489
<v Hou, Eric>That could be a really bad prediction.
Really bad prediction.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15852-0
02:24:57.989 --> 02:25:03.618
<v Hou, Eric>At least if we use half of the,
you know sample size and then we have two</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15852-1
02:25:03.618 --> 02:25:07.270
<v Hou, Eric>numbers,
two related number that we have entire</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15852-2
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:12.443
<v Hou, Eric>data set to compare against.
That makes more sense because at least</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15852-3
02:25:12.443 --> 02:25:17.769
<v Hou, Eric>I'm compare half the data versus its
average and then the other half.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15863-0
02:25:17.829 --> 02:25:22.287
<v Hou, Eric>Data versus another average.
So it definitely gonna be better than the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15863-1
02:25:22.287 --> 02:25:22.789
<v Hou, Eric>average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15871-0
02:25:23.569 --> 02:25:26.529
<v Hou, Eric>Of entire entire sample pool.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15874-0
02:25:26.809 --> 02:25:27.849
<v Hou, Eric>So then having.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15909-0
02:25:28.239 --> 02:25:34.770
<v Hou, Eric>Who values or have you have of the sample
size as the K is definitely improving the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15909-1
02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:38.736
<v Hou, Eric>accuracy,
meaning reducing the error or or RMSE so</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15909-2
02:25:38.736 --> 02:25:44.879
<v Hou, Eric>that if you keep pushing that right you
keep pushing that if you K equal to 1.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15924-0
02:25:45.279 --> 02:25:49.056
<v Hou, Eric>My prediction of those numbers going to
be that number,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15924-1
02:25:49.056 --> 02:25:53.239
<v Hou, Eric>I don't even borrow another information
to calculate average.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15931-0
02:25:53.239 --> 02:25:56.479
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's definitely closer and closer
to my actual value.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15939-0
02:25:57.739 --> 02:26:01.299
<v Hou, Eric>So that certainly can explain why.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15962-0
02:26:03.129 --> 02:26:11.355
<v Hou, Eric>This RMSE is consistently decreasing as K
decreases and and drop significantly once</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15962-1
02:26:11.355 --> 02:26:14.489
<v Hou, Eric>these K are getting closer to 0.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15967-0
02:26:15.409 --> 02:26:18.729
<v Hou, Eric>My question is,
is there any potential issue?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15984-0
02:26:35.179 --> 02:26:42.339
<v Hou, Eric>The potential issue is I do include a
keyword here train MSRMSE.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15988-0
02:26:42.819 --> 02:26:44.739
<v Hou, Eric>So the potential issue is the following.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/15998-0
02:26:46.289 --> 02:26:50.689
<v Hou, Eric>I did try to train RMSE and the
validation RMSE.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16002-0
02:26:52.289 --> 02:26:54.009
<v Hou, Eric>The train RMSE is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16015-0
02:26:56.129 --> 02:27:00.529
<v Hou, Eric>I build a KN model based upon the K the
train data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16032-0
02:27:01.209 --> 02:27:07.620
<v Hou, Eric>This is a chart I show you in the
previous slide. As a decreases,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16032-1
02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:10.729
<v Hou, Eric>my error decreases consistently.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16034-0
02:27:12.789 --> 02:27:13.149
<v Hou, Eric>However.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16045-0
02:27:14.689 --> 02:27:18.769
<v Hou, Eric>If I apply the model based upon the
training data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16063-0
02:27:19.819 --> 02:27:24.742
<v Hou, Eric>To the validation data and by the way,
when I train the model,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16063-1
02:27:24.742 --> 02:27:29.979
<v Hou, Eric>the model didn't see any single point in
this validation data set.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16073-0
02:27:30.809 --> 02:27:35.129
<v Hou, Eric>So the validation data set is a stranger
to the model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16085-0
02:27:36.599 --> 02:27:40.879
<v Hou, Eric>I apply the model based upon the train to
the validation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16091-0
02:27:41.399 --> 02:27:45.119
<v Hou, Eric>It decrease a little bit following the
train.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16094-0
02:27:45.319 --> 02:27:48.159
<v Hou, Eric>The gap is getting narrower, narrower.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16099-0
02:27:49.729 --> 02:27:50.929
<v Hou, Eric>And start increasing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16107-0
02:27:52.519 --> 02:27:56.199
<v Hou, Eric>So the validation error is increasing to
the top.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16121-0
02:27:57.769 --> 02:28:01.884
<v Hou, Eric>Once the K decreases and also the train
RMSE decreases.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16121-1
02:28:01.884 --> 02:28:04.089
<v Hou, Eric>What does this chart tell you?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16130-0
02:28:07.579 --> 02:28:12.379
<v Hou, Eric>And and maybe let me just ask question,
do you still think K equal to two?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16132-0
02:28:13.969 --> 02:28:14.009
<v Hou, Eric>Which?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16149-0
02:28:15.609 --> 02:28:19.049
<v Hou, Eric>Minimize the train RMSE and maximize the
validation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16154-0
02:28:19.129 --> 02:28:22.569
<v Hou, Eric>Rmse is a good K We should be choosing.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16156-0
02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:26.009
<v Benbenek, MATT>No.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16166-0
02:28:28.369 --> 02:28:30.609
<v Hou, Eric>The the answer is absolutely correct.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16168-0
02:28:29.769 --> 02:28:30.009
<v Benbenek, MATT>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16171-0
02:28:30.609 --> 02:28:32.009
<v Hou, Eric>It's not the case.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16182-0
02:28:32.009 --> 02:28:36.889
<v Hou, Eric>We should be choosing and why choosing
not K.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16197-0
02:28:37.009 --> 02:28:42.935
<v Hou, Eric>We have so small RMSE error associated
with train data and so big error</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16197-1
02:28:42.935 --> 02:28:45.569
<v Hou, Eric>associated with validation data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16202-0
02:28:48.479 --> 02:28:51.559
<v Benbenek, MATT>Should we pick where they intersect?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16228-0
02:28:53.779 --> 02:28:57.788
<v Hou, Eric>Or we can definitely do that.
I mean that's that's that's the the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16228-1
02:28:57.788 --> 02:29:01.979
<v Hou, Eric>concept is why K equals to two is so bad
and causing this divergent.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16242-0
02:29:05.249 --> 02:29:08.511
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah, I mean,
because they're different data points and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16242-1
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:11.889
<v Benbenek, MATT>at that point they're they're not really
showing the fit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16246-0
02:29:13.119 --> 02:29:13.959
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So so there.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16253-0
02:29:13.959 --> 02:29:17.519
<v Hou, Eric>There's a word associated with this and
what is that word, Matt?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16257-0
02:29:20.249 --> 02:29:21.769
<v Benbenek, MATT>Not correlated or.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16260-0
02:29:23.109 --> 02:29:23.509
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16265-0
02:29:23.669 --> 02:29:25.269
<v Hou, Eric>No word is overfitting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16264-0
02:29:25.889 --> 02:29:26.729
<v Benbenek, MATT>I over fit in.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16274-0
02:29:26.929 --> 02:29:30.249
<v Hou, Eric>Overfitting. OK, so this is a typical.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16269-0
02:29:27.199 --> 02:29:27.359
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16302-0
02:29:31.889 --> 02:29:37.149
<v Hou, Eric>Typical phenomena of we are overfitting
the data. OK, so once the overfitting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16302-1
02:29:37.149 --> 02:29:42.477
<v Hou, Eric>So there are some classic examples in
finance that people like to overfit their</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16302-2
02:29:42.477 --> 02:29:43.609
<v Hou, Eric>data for example.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16311-0
02:29:45.289 --> 02:29:48.089
<v Hou, Eric>You know when you predict a a stock
return.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16321-0
02:29:49.769 --> 02:29:54.129
<v Hou, Eric>You want to use all the data you collect
about that accorporate, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16343-0
02:29:54.129 --> 02:29:58.939
<v Hou, Eric>So then you want to know whether or not a
corporate operates in different countries,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16343-1
02:29:58.939 --> 02:30:03.409
<v Hou, Eric>and then you know there are components of
their and their their their revenue.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16353-0
02:30:04.039 --> 02:30:08.224
<v Hou, Eric>Different regions.
There are some classic examples that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16353-1
02:30:08.224 --> 02:30:09.719
<v Hou, Eric>people believe that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16385-0
02:30:11.529 --> 02:30:17.712
<v Hou, Eric>If if the CEO of the company entered the
price release wearing some color of socks</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16385-1
02:30:17.712 --> 02:30:23.001
<v Hou, Eric>and some color of, you know,
tie and then there would be a good reason</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16385-2
02:30:23.001 --> 02:30:25.609
<v Hou, Eric>to predict that stock price higher.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16398-0
02:30:25.729 --> 02:30:29.231
<v Hou, Eric>However, if not,
you know if that CEO wearing, for example,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16398-1
02:30:29.231 --> 02:30:30.049
<v Hou, Eric>the green tie.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16404-0
02:30:30.049 --> 02:30:33.209
<v Hou, Eric>So that's a sort of like a bad sign,
do you think?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16411-0
02:30:33.639 --> 02:30:37.359
<v Hou, Eric>Those kind of factors that really explain
the stock price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16421-0
02:30:39.329 --> 02:30:43.249
<v Hou, Eric>Color of Thai color of sauce,
color of suit.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16437-0
02:30:45.179 --> 02:30:49.534
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think those are the those are the
meaningful information predicting a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16437-1
02:30:49.534 --> 02:30:50.779
<v Hou, Eric>company's stock price?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16445-0
02:30:58.319 --> 02:30:59.919
<v Hou, Eric>But the answer is of course no.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16450-0
02:31:00.999 --> 02:31:05.879
<v Hou, Eric>But if you use you use those factors in
the model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16465-0
02:31:07.449 --> 02:31:12.289
<v Hou, Eric>You may find that those information
explains your volatility.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16476-0
02:31:12.289 --> 02:31:20.049
<v Hou, Eric>Your your your higher low stock price in
history, extremely well extremely well.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16481-0
02:31:20.049 --> 02:31:22.049
<v Hou, Eric>You're adding more information.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16490-0
02:31:22.289 --> 02:31:24.489
<v Hou, Eric>You're adding more such information.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16497-0
02:31:24.769 --> 02:31:28.169
<v Hou, Eric>You feel so confident that you can
explain the historical price.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16534-0
02:31:28.519 --> 02:31:32.437
<v Hou, Eric>So well,
and you feel those are the information</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16534-1
02:31:32.437 --> 02:31:37.091
<v Hou, Eric>can explain the future,
the future for that example is a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16534-2
02:31:37.091 --> 02:31:43.785
<v Hou, Eric>validation data set and the future gonna
tell you exactly what we're seeing here.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16534-3
02:31:43.785 --> 02:31:48.439
<v Hou, Eric>You have really low error associated with
your training.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16541-0
02:31:48.639 --> 02:31:52.359
<v Hou, Eric>You eventually have a biggest ever error
in your future because.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16550-0
02:31:53.569 --> 02:31:57.969
<v Hou, Eric>We are choosing or the analysts was
choosing some irrelevant information.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16582-0
02:31:58.319 --> 02:32:01.883
<v Hou, Eric>In the model training and in this very
example,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16582-1
02:32:01.883 --> 02:32:07.897
<v Hou, Eric>we believe every single point we want to
go as granular as possible to calculate</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16582-2
02:32:07.897 --> 02:32:11.239
<v Hou, Eric>the averages and that is that is
definitely.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16599-0
02:32:12.809 --> 02:32:17.306
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna gonna cost this overfitting
problems and then you should be going</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16599-1
02:32:17.306 --> 02:32:19.929
<v Hou, Eric>that far in my opinion. I think I I right.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16608-0
02:32:19.929 --> 02:32:23.044
<v Hou, Eric>Matt,
you can just choose across and that that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16608-1
02:32:23.044 --> 02:32:24.569
<v Hou, Eric>should be good because.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16611-0
02:32:26.249 --> 02:32:26.489
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16621-0
02:32:26.489 --> 02:32:30.729
<v Hou, Eric>But you know the the the the cross has
some issue because there are some.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16629-0
02:32:31.599 --> 02:32:34.799
<v Hou, Eric>Fine before the validation is ready,
raising has error.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16647-0
02:32:34.799 --> 02:32:37.087
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm not sure if you wanna choose
that,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16647-1
02:32:37.087 --> 02:32:41.079
<v Hou, Eric>so you may want to actually choosing the
one that minimized the validation error.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16650-0
02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:42.839
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16661-0
02:32:43.279 --> 02:32:50.199
<v Hou, Eric>So this is something that you know quite
risky for using the KNN model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16673-0
02:32:53.729 --> 02:32:58.729
<v Hou, Eric>So then people use this log of 1 / K to
to.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16693-0
02:33:00.689 --> 02:33:05.962
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of model complexity of the model and
then here is a chart of using the data</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16693-1
02:33:05.962 --> 02:33:06.809
<v Hou, Eric>that we have.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16704-0
02:33:07.129 --> 02:33:11.770
<v Hou, Eric>So then once the complexity goes higher
and then big gap between the training and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16704-1
02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:13.129
<v Hou, Eric>the validation accuracy.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16717-0
02:33:13.959 --> 02:33:18.279
<v Hou, Eric>So there's definitely thing called a bias
variance tradeoff.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16730-0
02:33:18.999 --> 02:33:22.400
<v Hou, Eric>So,
so that sort of explanation or the theory</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16730-1
02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:26.319
<v Hou, Eric>behind this chart,
although our chart does not look.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16744-0
02:33:26.919 --> 02:33:31.909
<v Hou, Eric>100% similar to the theoretical chart
where this theoretical chart we are</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16744-1
02:33:31.909 --> 02:33:32.719
<v Hou, Eric>seeing that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16752-0
02:33:34.289 --> 02:33:35.609
<v Hou, Eric>We're seeing similar things, right?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16791-0
02:33:35.609 --> 02:33:41.304
<v Hou, Eric>So the model complexity getting higher,
so the prediction error for train is</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16791-1
02:33:41.304 --> 02:33:45.593
<v Hou, Eric>getting smaller and smaller always
consistently. However,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16791-2
02:33:45.593 --> 02:33:50.844
<v Hou, Eric>the task will eventually go high,
so that what we can see is the model</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16791-3
02:33:50.844 --> 02:33:53.729
<v Hou, Eric>complexity, meaning the K being higher.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16794-0
02:33:53.929 --> 02:33:55.969
<v Hou, Eric>We definitely have a low variance.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16802-0
02:33:56.039 --> 02:33:59.599
<v Hou, Eric>It's because you can see the curves are
more and more smooth.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16841-0
02:33:59.839 --> 02:34:03.497
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely smoother than the higher
the lower K,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16841-1
02:34:03.497 --> 02:34:08.849
<v Hou, Eric>but you definitely have a higher bias
because we are just basically predicting</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16841-2
02:34:08.849 --> 02:34:14.201
<v Hou, Eric>average and then the bias is really high
when you move this complexity higher,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16841-3
02:34:14.201 --> 02:34:19.079
<v Hou, Eric>meaning you are adding you reducing this
K and make the model more and.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16844-0
02:34:19.079 --> 02:34:19.479
<v Hou, Eric>More complex.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16857-0
02:34:21.049 --> 02:34:24.809
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, the volatility is going to be really,
really high as we can see from the chart.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16867-0
02:34:25.699 --> 02:34:27.819
<v Hou, Eric>And and the bias will be low.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16879-0
02:34:27.819 --> 02:34:32.555
<v Hou, Eric>The issue is they will eventually the
task sample test error and the training</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16879-1
02:34:32.555 --> 02:34:34.619
<v Hou, Eric>error will be eventually diverged.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16892-0
02:34:35.039 --> 02:34:38.745
<v Hou, Eric>So this is called bias,
where the trade off and then you need to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16892-1
02:34:38.745 --> 02:34:39.999
<v Hou, Eric>take care of this, OK.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16903-0
02:34:41.569 --> 02:34:44.209
<v Hou, Eric>And and as you can see the K equal to two.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16908-0
02:34:44.209 --> 02:34:45.609
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just using some sample data.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16937-0
02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:49.317
<v Hou, Eric>It's really, really high variance, really,
really high variance,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16937-1
02:34:49.317 --> 02:34:52.912
<v Hou, Eric>but the bias is relatively low because
from the training data,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16937-2
02:34:52.912 --> 02:34:56.849
<v Hou, Eric>another data there is covering a lot of
other data behind the scene.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16947-0
02:34:57.929 --> 02:35:01.329
<v Hou, Eric>But if you choose K = 20,
it's definitely higher bias.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16954-0
02:35:01.329 --> 02:35:05.769
<v Hou, Eric>There's a lot of grey pieces not covering.
For example this number.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16966-0
02:35:06.239 --> 02:35:10.497
<v Hou, Eric>I'm using this this model,
but definitely this model looks much</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16966-1
02:35:10.497 --> 02:35:12.759
<v Hou, Eric>smoother than the K code 22 model.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16987-0
02:35:14.329 --> 02:35:18.723
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the sort that's is the the bias
variance or tradeoff what we are seeing</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16987-1
02:35:18.723 --> 02:35:19.849
<v Hou, Eric>from models and then?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16993-0
02:35:22.169 --> 02:35:22.809
<v Hou, Eric>This is just the KNN.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/16997-0
02:35:22.809 --> 02:35:23.809
<v Hou, Eric>Just a starter.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17003-0
02:35:24.289 --> 02:35:27.009
<v Hou, Eric>We have only one parameter to choose from.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17007-0
02:35:27.009 --> 02:35:27.969
<v Hou, Eric>We have only.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17033-0
02:35:27.969 --> 02:35:33.428
<v Hou, Eric>We have only need to only change the K
from the tree model from the neural</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17033-1
02:35:33.428 --> 02:35:37.140
<v Hou, Eric>network model.
We have a number and sometimes that</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17033-2
02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:41.289
<v Hou, Eric>number is really big of a parameters that
we can change.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17076-0
02:35:42.639 --> 02:35:48.325
<v Hou, Eric>So this is we can,
I will remind you that bias trade off all</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17076-1
02:35:48.325 --> 02:35:55.131
<v Hou, Eric>the time to tell you that it's not only
focus on the train sample error,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17076-2
02:35:55.131 --> 02:35:59.605
<v Hou, Eric>you need to do either validation or test
error.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17076-3
02:35:59.605 --> 02:36:04.919
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a meaningful error you want to
have and then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17085-0
02:36:05.359 --> 02:36:08.159
<v Hou, Eric>Keep in mind that the bias variance
tradeoff.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17091-0
02:36:09.249 --> 02:36:10.969
<v Hou, Eric>In KNN is so obvious.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17131-0
02:36:11.519 --> 02:36:16.170
<v Hou, Eric>Model, but for the trees,
since you have so many parameters,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17131-1
02:36:16.170 --> 02:36:20.821
<v Hou, Eric>is not as obvious,
but you will need to keep this concept in</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17131-2
02:36:20.821 --> 02:36:27.226
<v Hou, Eric>your mind that you don't want to make the
model hyper complex because you make them</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17131-3
02:36:27.226 --> 02:36:28.599
<v Hou, Eric>all hyper complex.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17144-0
02:36:28.919 --> 02:36:32.512
<v Hou, Eric>You're introducing high variance and then
low bias,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17144-1
02:36:32.512 --> 02:36:37.279
<v Hou, Eric>and however that may be overfeeding your
data and the tree model is.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17156-0
02:36:38.089 --> 02:36:42.169
<v Hou, Eric>So easy to overfit and and and and that's
why I'm just.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17166-0
02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:45.719
<v Hou, Eric>Introduce this concept, this reminder now,
then later.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17175-0
02:36:47.199 --> 02:36:54.639
<v Hou, Eric>So what's the way of sort of help us with
this trade off is?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17182-0
02:36:57.049 --> 02:36:58.609
<v Hou, Eric>You this is. I'm sorry.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17188-0
02:36:58.609 --> 02:37:00.089
<v Hou, Eric>This is a really good strategy.
You want to use.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17210-0
02:37:01.889 --> 02:37:06.988
<v Hou, Eric>Is you split the data into train and
validation and test.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17210-1
02:37:06.988 --> 02:37:11.209
<v Hou, Eric>You can do 5025 and 25.
You can do 6020 and 20.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17215-0
02:37:12.509 --> 02:37:15.229
<v Hou, Eric>You train a model based upon a train set.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17222-0
02:37:16.769 --> 02:37:19.569
<v Hou, Eric>You pass your model on validation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17265-0
02:37:21.249 --> 02:37:25.506
<v Hou, Eric>Whenever you choose and then you choose
the code and call.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17265-1
02:37:25.506 --> 02:37:28.969
<v Hou, Eric>Pass the model based upon the validation
magic.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17265-2
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:34.164
<v Hou, Eric>No matter what magic you choose to select,
the best model, say is RMSE.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17265-3
02:37:34.164 --> 02:37:40.080
<v Hou, Eric>Say it's accuracy, say it's EFF on score,
say whatever you based on that and then</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17265-4
02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:40.369
<v Hou, Eric>you.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17269-0
02:37:40.369 --> 02:37:41.649
<v Hou, Eric>Run your model on test.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17288-0
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:49.681
<v Hou, Eric>Just keep in your mind that you have to
do that. You choose a model on validation,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17288-1
02:37:49.681 --> 02:37:52.829
<v Hou, Eric>you run it on task, then just do it once.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17311-0
02:37:54.369 --> 02:38:01.749
<v Hou, Eric>And if you ever start using that task
data set to try a multiple number of</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17311-1
02:38:01.749 --> 02:38:04.209
<v Hou, Eric>models and then and then.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17313-0
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.969
<v Hou, Eric>Wait.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17317-0
02:38:06.879 --> 02:38:07.839
<v Hou, Eric>Did I just call you this?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17319-0
02:38:07.919 --> 02:38:09.639
<v Hou, Eric>No, hopefully not.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17333-0
02:38:11.209 --> 02:38:14.790
<v Hou, Eric>If you start using the task and tried so
many different models again,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17333-1
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:15.609
<v Hou, Eric>again and again.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17344-0
02:38:17.289 --> 02:38:19.449
<v Hou, Eric>You are starting the task as a validation.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17363-0
02:38:20.049 --> 02:38:25.257
<v Hou, Eric>The task will not be become the task
anymore and that you are introducing bias</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17363-1
02:38:25.257 --> 02:38:29.609
<v Hou, Eric>over there and you are introducing the
overfeeding in over there.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17366-0
02:38:29.609 --> 02:38:31.289
<v Hou, Eric>So a lot of people.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17372-0
02:38:33.009 --> 02:38:35.849
<v Hou, Eric>May make this mistake before.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17382-0
02:38:37.489 --> 02:38:42.649
<v Hou, Eric>From my from my career,
I've seen a really famous leading.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17390-0
02:38:44.169 --> 02:38:45.769
<v Hou, Eric>Consulting firm and then deliver their.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17398-0
02:38:47.529 --> 02:38:50.569
<v Hou, Eric>$20 million project to their client.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17410-0
02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:56.049
<v Hou, Eric>They stuck in delivering their model and
the reason is they were overfitting.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17430-0
02:38:57.769 --> 02:39:03.593
<v Hou, Eric>They were using their Tesla data as a
validation and keep adding regressors to</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17430-1
02:39:03.593 --> 02:39:06.689
<v Hou, Eric>their model and keep making that code and.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17452-0
02:39:07.239 --> 02:39:13.492
<v Hou, Eric>In their mind, accuracy better and better,
and then the actual out of sample future</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17452-1
02:39:13.492 --> 02:39:16.842
<v Hou, Eric>data,
their prediction is not as good at all</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17452-2
02:39:16.842 --> 02:39:17.959
<v Hou, Eric>they have seen.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17458-0
02:39:18.729 --> 02:39:21.529
<v Hou, Eric>They have positive for that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17478-0
02:39:23.609 --> 02:39:27.621
<v Hou, Eric>Their model training test data is getting
higher accuracy whenever they test the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17478-1
02:39:27.621 --> 02:39:30.049
<v Hou, Eric>model in the real line,
the accuracy is dropped.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17497-0
02:39:30.049 --> 02:39:33.349
<v Hou, Eric>It is declining,
so they they posit that for for for a</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17497-1
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:36.289
<v Hou, Eric>long time,
a lot of professional data scientists</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17497-2
02:39:36.289 --> 02:39:37.369
<v Hou, Eric>make this mistake.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17503-0
02:39:37.529 --> 02:39:39.409
<v Hou, Eric>I just want you to know that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17508-0
02:39:39.409 --> 02:39:40.289
<v Hou, Eric>Keep your mind.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17533-0
02:39:40.529 --> 02:39:44.263
<v Hou, Eric>This could be one mistake you will be
making, but if you make the mistake,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17533-1
02:39:44.263 --> 02:39:47.350
<v Hou, Eric>that's not a that's not a big issue.
Everyone makes mistakes,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17533-2
02:39:47.350 --> 02:39:50.089
<v Hou, Eric>so keep in mind someone some,
some person called Eric.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17535-0
02:39:50.989 --> 02:39:52.229
<v Hou, Eric>Tell you that.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17559-0
02:39:53.769 --> 02:39:57.293
<v Hou, Eric>There will be an issue like this,
so then you may need to change your</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17559-1
02:39:57.293 --> 02:40:01.169
<v Hou, Eric>strategy and and and change your and
solve your solve your mistake and solve</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17559-2
02:40:01.169 --> 02:40:02.529
<v Hou, Eric>your problem at the moment.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17562-0
02:40:02.929 --> 02:40:05.089
<v Hou, Eric>So just give me a remind.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17565-0
02:40:05.409 --> 02:40:06.409
<v Hou, Eric>Not a big deal.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17572-0
02:40:06.409 --> 02:40:10.409
<v Hou, Eric>And then and that's that's sort of it.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17587-0
02:40:10.409 --> 02:40:15.439
<v Hou, Eric>And then the cross validation,
you have several ways and then the K fold</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17587-1
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:17.369
<v Hou, Eric>is one way we will be using.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17615-0
02:40:19.209 --> 02:40:24.489
<v Hou, Eric>And and and and luckily,
unluckily in many Python packages,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17615-1
02:40:24.489 --> 02:40:30.385
<v Hou, Eric>the K fold is 1 parameter.
You can just always choose that and and</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17615-2
02:40:30.385 --> 02:40:31.529
<v Hou, Eric>turn that on.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17622-0
02:40:32.039 --> 02:40:33.919
<v Hou, Eric>And then you, you you'll be covered.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17635-0
02:40:33.959 --> 02:40:36.986
<v Hou, Eric>So a lot of package already cover you
from that,</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17635-1
02:40:36.986 --> 02:40:40.199
<v Hou, Eric>just in case you have to build your model
your own.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17647-0
02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:44.109
<v Hou, Eric>Keep your mind there is a there is a bias
variance tradeoff.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17650-0
02:40:45.929 --> 02:40:46.809
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17657-0
02:40:55.809 --> 02:40:58.449
<v Hou, Eric>I I think today what I just introduced a
lot of things.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17663-0
02:41:00.169 --> 02:41:02.489
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully is not super overwhelming.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17694-0
02:41:08.409 --> 02:41:13.606
<v Hou, Eric>All right. So if there is no question,
I'll send you the invite for to the</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17694-1
02:41:13.606 --> 02:41:17.971
<v Hou, Eric>office hour tomorrow on Tuesday and on
Thursday, 4:30 to 5:30.</v>

02:41:23.209 --> 02:41:26.750
<v Hou, Eric>I'll I'll have to join office hour online
and use teams.</v>

45f59a62-6948-4ae7-aa19-3bcd5a3c77e5/17716-1
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:31.534
