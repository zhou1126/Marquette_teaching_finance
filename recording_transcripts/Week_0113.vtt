00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:14.098
<v Teske, Benjamin>applications and then the user ML

00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:16.078

<v Mertens, Aidric>Just really excited about learning more
about machine learning and I work in</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1655-1
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:07.338
<v Mertens, Aidric>corporate treasury for a bank,
so it'd be nice to learn how to apply it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1672-0
00:12:08.258 --> 00:12:14.538
<v Mertens, Aidric>Kind of a casual user user of AI,

<v Mertens, Aidric>So just learned more about stuff like
that would be great.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1690-0
00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:20.958

00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:26.508
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you use SQL,
you're pretty much like pulling the data</v>

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:02.868
<v Galligan, Willy>My name is Willie.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1797-0
00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:07.228
<v Galligan, Willy>I'm a grad student doing a master's in
finance at Marquette.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1814-0
00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:11.181
<v Galligan, Willy>I did my undergrad at Marquette in
finance real estate,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1814-1
00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:13.548
<v Galligan, Willy>and I was also in the AIM program there.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1848-0
00:13:15.098 --> 00:13:20.179
<v Galligan, Willy>I was some limited experience with AI
applying it to finance and real estate,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1848-1
00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:25.260
<v Galligan, Willy>but want to take this class to basically
grow that knowledge and understand a</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1848-2
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.778
<v Galligan, Willy>little bit more of the the deeper
workings behind it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1849-0
00:13:31.348 --> 00:13:31.948
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds good.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1856-0
00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:39.298
<v Hou, Eric>Did we just go through everyone that we
have in the in the room?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1864-0
00:13:41.538 --> 00:13:43.618
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe. OK, perfect.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1868-0
00:13:43.618 --> 00:13:45.538
<v Hou, Eric>So I I took the note right.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1876-0
00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:48.778
<v Hou, Eric>So then we do have some undergrad
students coming here.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1908-0
00:13:50.418 --> 00:13:56.353
<v Hou, Eric>We have some grad and MBA and definitely
some some folks really have a really good</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1908-1
00:13:56.353 --> 00:14:00.858
<v Hou, Eric>experience using AI and some folks really
said OK, so limited.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1916-0
00:14:02.498 --> 00:14:04.858
<v Hou, Eric>Background using AI,
but it's totally fine.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1919-0
00:14:05.528 --> 00:14:05.888
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1933-0
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:10.728
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's talk about what we want to
achieve in in this course, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1938-0
00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:14.168
<v Hou, Eric>So then what does this course really
cover? OK, just.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1944-0
00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:17.698
<v Hou, Eric>Expectation management, right? So then?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1977-0
00:14:20.378 --> 00:14:26.603
<v Hou, Eric>So what we want to cover or what I want
to cover is I want to go through a range</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1977-1
00:14:26.603 --> 00:14:32.828
<v Hou, Eric>of AI models and technically this AI kind
of thing is has been really used for a</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1977-2
00:14:32.828 --> 00:14:34.058
<v Hou, Eric>lot of purposes.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1996-0
00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.072
<v Hou, Eric>So you can call a lot of models as AI.
For example,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1996-1
00:14:37.072 --> 00:14:40.928
<v Hou, Eric>you can call the large language models
like a lot of folks mentioned.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/1999-0
00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:41.968
<v Hou, Eric>They're using open AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2033-0
00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:45.606
<v Hou, Eric>They're using Gemini,
so they use those as a large models and</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2033-1
00:14:45.606 --> 00:14:49.333
<v Hou, Eric>it's definitely part of AI.
And then some folks mentioned that they</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2033-2
00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:53.169
<v Hou, Eric>work with ML team so ML team,
they were dealing with a lot of machine</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2033-3
00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:56.128
<v Hou, Eric>learning kind of things,
machine learning algorithms.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2033-4
00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.608
<v Hou, Eric>So linear regression start.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2042-0
00:14:57.608 --> 00:15:00.888
<v Hou, Eric>With a linear regression starting with,
you know clustering.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2050-0
00:15:01.698 --> 00:15:04.298
<v Hou, Eric>And algorithm starting to to to neural
network.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2060-0
00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:06.568
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the major learning areas.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2078-0
00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:13.184
<v Hou, Eric>So so aiml covers a lot of things.
I just wanna go from really fundamental</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2078-1
00:15:13.184 --> 00:15:16.888
<v Hou, Eric>models to some really advanced models. OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2102-0
00:15:17.128 --> 00:15:22.431
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I I look for some real world
use cases to have. You know,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2102-1
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:28.436
<v Hou, Eric>we can experiment using the models that
we learn and see what we can derive.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2102-2
00:15:28.436 --> 00:15:29.528
<v Hou, Eric>Right so then.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2110-0
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.978
<v Hou, Eric>So I hear people there are there are some.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2116-0
00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:36.578
<v Hou, Eric>Students in this class their.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2118-0
00:15:36.578 --> 00:15:38.858
<v Hou, Eric>Their PMS, their MBAs.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2132-0
00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:42.898
<v Hou, Eric>Their their undergrad students and we
have different backgrounds.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2135-0
00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:44.818
<v Hou, Eric>So let me talk about what.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2146-0
00:15:46.538 --> 00:15:49.578
<v Hou, Eric>This idea of creating this course where
where do?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2174-0
00:15:49.578 --> 00:15:54.251
<v Hou, Eric>Why do we have this idea? OK,
so then as I wanted to mentioned,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2174-1
00:15:54.251 --> 00:16:00.018
<v Hou, Eric>I I want to the use Chicago Booth School
of Business for for my MBA, so right.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2180-0
00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:03.538
<v Hou, Eric>So I definitely went through the route
that you are going through.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2184-0
00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:06.748
<v Hou, Eric>So the idea is.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2198-0
00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:14.138
<v Hou, Eric>At Booth there are some requirement of of
taking stat class.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2211-0
00:16:14.138 --> 00:16:18.218
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not sure I I do know that we have
some MBA folks here in this class.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2215-0
00:16:18.738 --> 00:16:22.098
<v Hou, Eric>Does market require you to take any step
class?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2230-0
00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.565
<v Matt Benbenek>No,
that's not one of the required lessons,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2229-0
00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:29.388
<v Hou, Eric>No. Oh, that's not a requirement.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2230-1
00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:28.738
<v Matt Benbenek>no.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2240-0
00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.652
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.
So maybe we should change that policy,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2240-1
00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:33.028
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2251-0
00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:38.588
<v Hou, Eric>So so Booth does require everyone to take
a stab class.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2260-0
00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:43.548
<v Hou, Eric>So the stack class offering are coming
from, you know some basic stats.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2269-0
00:16:45.298 --> 00:16:47.898
<v Hou, Eric>To big data at the moment,
it's still making sense.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2288-0
00:16:49.618 --> 00:16:53.731
<v Hou, Eric>To mature learning AI,
so this is a one of a class that a lot of</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2288-1
00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:56.578
<v Hou, Eric>MBAs at U Chicago,
they really want to take.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2326-0
00:16:57.858 --> 00:17:02.699
<v Hou, Eric>And we're sort of following the same idea
that, you know, in, in this,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2326-1
00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:08.154
<v Hou, Eric>in this moment when two years ago open AI
becomes to a tool to everyone, right.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2326-2
00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:13.609
<v Hou, Eric>So the exposure to everyone and then it's
definitely got more and more popular,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2326-3
00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:14.018
<v Hou, Eric>right.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2345-0
00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:20.012
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then this is a really an.
This is really a period that you cannot</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2345-1
00:17:20.012 --> 00:17:22.658
<v Hou, Eric>really ignore the existence of AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2351-0
00:17:22.658 --> 00:17:24.738
<v Hou, Eric>I'm pretty sure you guys are using AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2354-0
00:17:24.738 --> 00:17:26.218
<v Hou, Eric>I'm pretty sure if you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2364-0
00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:30.488
<v Hou, Eric>Say to different courses you're using AI,
I'm pretty sure.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2384-0
00:17:30.488 --> 00:17:34.849
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe you're using AI to write code?
I'm pretty sure not using AI to write</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2384-1
00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:36.128
<v Hou, Eric>Excel formula for you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2401-0
00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:42.188
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is really area of using AI
like one question I asked one of the</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2401-1
00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:45.808
<v Hou, Eric>students that you use.
Let me check my notes.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2416-0
00:17:49.218 --> 00:17:53.498
<v Hou, Eric>So you use AI before and then you use AI
for marketing, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2420-0
00:17:53.498 --> 00:17:55.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then I asked the student.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2425-0
00:17:56.858 --> 00:17:58.458
<v Hou, Eric>Whether or not you use AI to do research.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2449-0
00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:02.856
<v Hou, Eric>Whether or not you'd fully trust the AI
outcome,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2449-1
00:18:02.856 --> 00:18:09.529
<v Hou, Eric>you know the answer is not necessarily.
The reason is the AI tool. For example,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2449-2
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:11.448
<v Hou, Eric>Jim and I were open AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2454-0
00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:13.048
<v Hou, Eric>They do hallucinate, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2463-0
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.128
<v Hou, Eric>So then they may not give you the right
answer.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2476-0
00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:20.613
<v Hou, Eric>So you need to know the pros and cons of
different models every.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2476-1
00:18:20.613 --> 00:18:22.568
<v Hou, Eric>There's no perfect model.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2487-0
00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:27.418
<v Hou, Eric>Even open AI is not perfect either,
so there is no perfect model.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2491-0
00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:29.178
<v Hou, Eric>So I want you to understand that.</v>

00:18:31.448 --> 00:18:35.008
<v Hou, Eric>Where model is good at and where the

00:18:35.408 --> 00:18:42.584
<v Hou, Eric>So is my expectation that you guys after

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2526-1
00:18:42.584 --> 00:18:43.448
<v Hou, Eric>developer?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2527-0
00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:45.048
<v Hou, Eric>Absolutely not.</v>

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:50.608
<v Hou, Eric>So you're not going to be a Python
developer just taking this class.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2563-0
00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:55.278
<v Hou, Eric>And if you do want to be a Python
developer with some finance background,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2563-1
00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:57.928
<v Hou, Eric>so you need to take some computer science.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2566-0
00:18:58.698 --> 00:18:59.258

00:19:02.488 --> 00:19:07.028
<v Hou, Eric>You're not going to be a Python developer
through this class.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2593-1
00:19:07.028 --> 00:19:11.128
<v Hou, Eric>Are you going to be a modeler going
through this class?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2599-0
00:19:11.128 --> 00:19:14.648
<v Hou, Eric>I will say 30 or 40%.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2611-0
00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:19.648
<v Hou, Eric>You understand the models,
but you can work with your ML team.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2631-0
00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:24.218
<v Hou, Eric>You can work with your data team,
so you can specifically ask them to build</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2631-1
00:19:24.218 --> 00:19:28.488
<v Hou, Eric>a model for you and you understand the
language they're talking about.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2638-0
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.088

<v Hou, Eric>team is talking in one language and and
the business team is talking in different</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2732-2
00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:13.028
<v Hou, Eric>language and then how who gonna connect
those two team together.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/2753-0

he have like really a mathematic</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/5898-1
00:47:13.257 --> 00:47:14.188

00:48:31.098 --> 00:48:34.178
<v Hou, Eric>So then he's picking up AI Nadia.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6073-0
00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:36.058

00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:40.824
<v Hou, Eric>He's an MBA from Wharton School,
so that he does not have AI background</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6088-1
00:48:40.824 --> 00:48:43.538
<v Hou, Eric>and also he's really focused on strategy.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6093-0
00:48:44.348 --> 00:48:46.188
<v Hou, Eric>Is also the thing that when she realized.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6105-0
00:48:46.978 --> 00:48:51.898
<v Hou, Eric>That AI is really critical to drive

<v Hou, Eric>*** has to learn it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6131-0
00:49:01.378 --> 00:49:04.138
<v Hou, Eric>She has to create a combination.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6132-0
00:49:04.138 --> 00:49:05.978
<v Hou, Eric>Consider AI strategy.</v>

00:49:06.138 --> 00:49:07.218
<v Hou, Eric>So then he started learning.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6141-0

00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:14.948
<v Hou, Eric>So I I think to answer your question,
it is really not you have that background,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6156-1
00:49:14.948 --> 00:49:15.898
<v Hou, Eric>it's really.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6172-0

<v Hou, Eric>and then you clearly have a goal of using
AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6179-0
00:49:22.258 --> 00:49:25.298

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6281-2
00:50:14.347 --> 00:50:17.068
<v Hou, Eric>and I don't mind sending them cold e-mail.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6287-0
00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:18.948
<v Hou, Eric>E-mail. Hey,
do you want to present anything here?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6289-0
00:50:26.418 --> 00:50:26.938
<v Hou, Eric>No question.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6291-0
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:30.608
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6293-0
00:50:32.758 --> 00:50:33.038
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6299-0
00:50:33.038 --> 00:50:35.318
<v Hou, Eric>So that's talk about data, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6304-0
00:50:35.318 --> 00:50:38.358
<v Hou, Eric>So then we will be dealing with data.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6313-0
00:50:39.928 --> 00:50:42.288
<v Hou, Eric>Fortunately or unfortunately, OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6319-0
00:50:42.688 --> 00:50:46.008
<v Hou, Eric>So there are we gonna use a lot of APIs.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6360-0
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:50.991
<v Hou, Eric>I hope you guys know what API is.
The application program interface so</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6360-1
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:56.562
<v Hou, Eric>their API from you know Yahoo Finance and
there's there's some API and then there</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6360-2
00:50:56.562 --> 00:51:00.841
<v Hou, Eric>is you know SEC Edgar.
There are some there was API so you can</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6360-3
00:51:00.841 --> 00:51:01.928
<v Hou, Eric>you can you can.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6371-0
00:51:02.318 --> 00:51:08.518
<v Hou, Eric>Actually fetch the 10K10Q data and then
you will learn from those examples.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6376-0
00:51:10.048 --> 00:51:10.808
<v Hou, Eric>And then there is a.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6394-0
00:51:11.048 --> 00:51:14.445
<v Hou, Eric>There is a website called FMP,
the financial model,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6394-1
00:51:14.445 --> 00:51:16.208
<v Hou, Eric>the financial modeling.com.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6398-0
00:51:16.408 --> 00:51:18.288
<v Hou, Eric>So then I subscribe it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6414-0
00:51:18.288 --> 00:51:23.016
<v Hou, Eric>So then there's definitely a tons of data
over there and the cargo is another.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6414-1
00:51:23.016 --> 00:51:26.008
<v Hou, Eric>Another area that you can find a ton of
data, OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6421-0
00:51:26.328 --> 00:51:30.808
<v Hou, Eric>So we definitely gonna use AI and then
you will code.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6424-0
00:51:31.568 --> 00:51:32.728
<v Hou, Eric>OK, you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6453-0
00:51:32.728 --> 00:51:37.764
<v Hou, Eric>I'll share with you some sample code so
you can switch. You can tweak,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6453-1
00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:41.453
<v Hou, Eric>change the codes and then you can you can
apply to.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6453-2
00:51:41.453 --> 00:51:44.928
<v Hou, Eric>You can apply the new codes on the on
your data.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6472-0
00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:50.193
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm not expecting that you gonna code
from scratch, but if you want,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6472-1
00:51:50.193 --> 00:51:52.008
<v Hou, Eric>there's certainly you can.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6491-0
00:51:52.328 --> 00:51:56.237
<v Hou, Eric>But that's that's really a good
additional effort you wanna put.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6491-1
00:51:56.237 --> 00:52:00.867
<v Hou, Eric>But if you don't want to code you can
copy paste my code and apply it to the</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6491-2
00:52:00.867 --> 00:52:01.168
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6493-0
00:52:02.128 --> 00:52:02.608
<v Hou, Eric>Like what?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6518-0
00:52:02.608 --> 00:52:07.263
<v Hou, Eric>I said the motivation and expectation is
you know what you're running.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6518-1
00:52:07.263 --> 00:52:12.048
<v Hou, Eric>You know the pros and cons that the codes
in front of you is generating.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6519-0
00:52:12.088 --> 00:52:13.248
<v Hou, Eric>That's it, OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6542-0
00:52:14.808 --> 00:52:20.201
<v Hou, Eric>We will definitely use LMS,
so I'm not sure what's the what's the</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6542-1
00:52:20.201 --> 00:52:24.368
<v Hou, Eric>mark on university policy targeting
concerning AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6549-0
00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:28.168
<v Hou, Eric>Do they allow you guys using AI or do
they?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6555-0
00:52:29.808 --> 00:52:31.648
<v Hou, Eric>Forbid you guys using AI at all.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6563-0
00:52:32.408 --> 00:52:34.208
<v Hou, Eric>What? What's the AI strategy policy?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6567-0
00:52:32.778 --> 00:52:33.578
<v Capozzoli, Jay>Yeah you could.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6572-0
00:52:35.138 --> 00:52:37.178
<v Capozzoli, Jay>You can use it,
but I think you just have to cite it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6582-0
00:52:38.428 --> 00:52:41.108
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, you had? OK, you you can use it,
but you have decided.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6588-0
00:52:41.928 --> 00:52:42.808
<v Capozzoli, Jay>Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6586-0
00:52:42.078 --> 00:52:42.438
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6592-0
00:52:43.928 --> 00:52:44.168
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6609-0
00:52:44.328 --> 00:52:50.888
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Same same for my other MBA courses where
we did SQL, Python And our programming.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6625-0
00:52:51.048 --> 00:52:54.354
<v Haroon, Sufyan>They all allowed us to use it as a
starting point,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6625-1
00:52:54.354 --> 00:52:58.568
<v Haroon, Sufyan>but we had to side cite whatever we took
from open AI or Gemini.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6656-0
00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:05.261
<v Hou, Eric>So it's the final codes or some
intermediate codes that you have decided</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6656-1
00:53:05.261 --> 00:53:10.472
<v Hou, Eric>because sometimes they don't.
Whatever AI they won't generate the codes</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6656-2
00:53:10.472 --> 00:53:14.018
<v Hou, Eric>that no bug and then generate whatever
you want.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6665-0
00:53:15.618 --> 00:53:18.778
<v Hou, Eric>Do they ask you guys to provide a prompt
that you send to the AI?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6684-0
00:53:20.518 --> 00:53:23.007
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yep,
they are still send our entire</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6669-0
00:53:21.288 --> 00:53:21.688
<v Hou, Eric>Oh.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6684-1
00:53:23.007 --> 00:53:28.398
<v Haroon, Sufyan>conversation list or whatever prompts we
used to get to the final conclusion.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6686-0
00:53:29.238 --> 00:53:29.838
<v Hou, Eric>Oh really?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6687-0
00:53:29.878 --> 00:53:30.158
<v Hou, Eric>Oh wow.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6696-0
00:53:32.378 --> 00:53:37.458
<v Hou, Eric>OK, that's that's OK alright.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6700-0
00:53:37.458 --> 00:53:40.058
<v Hou, Eric>So similar strategy here.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6715-0
00:53:40.658 --> 00:53:43.999
<v Hou, Eric>You're free to use AI you you can
certainly use open AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6715-1
00:53:43.999 --> 00:53:45.698
<v Hou, Eric>You can certainly use Gemini.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6722-0
00:53:47.598 --> 00:53:50.198
<v Hou, Eric>I I do love cloud of anthropic.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6734-0
00:53:51.768 --> 00:53:57.688
<v Hou, Eric>You can use that as well and you honestly
you don't have to send me the prompt.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6771-0
00:53:58.288 --> 00:54:01.642
<v Hou, Eric>I mean you,
I assume you have a lot of prompt you</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6771-1
00:54:01.642 --> 00:54:05.063
<v Hou, Eric>send to the AI,
you don't have to send any prompt,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6771-2
00:54:05.063 --> 00:54:10.295
<v Hou, Eric>you just need to tell me that whether
this code is coded it's you coded or AI</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6771-3
00:54:10.295 --> 00:54:13.448
<v Hou, Eric>coded or or you work with AI coded.
That's it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6779-0
00:54:14.008 --> 00:54:16.968
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And then what I have to say is.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6789-0
00:54:17.808 --> 00:54:20.768
<v Hou, Eric>Eventually, whatever you receive,
you will learn from this course.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6798-0
00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:26.768
<v Hou, Eric>It's really up to you,
like how much you exercise with the code.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6829-0
00:54:28.078 --> 00:54:34.262
<v Hou, Eric>You can actually generate user AI to
generate everything anything you want,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6829-1
00:54:34.262 --> 00:54:37.598
<v Hou, Eric>but AI still there. AI still evolving AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6839-0
00:54:37.718 --> 00:54:41.716
<v Hou, Eric>Understand what you wanna do,
but I hope you eventually understand what</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6839-1
00:54:41.716 --> 00:54:42.438
<v Hou, Eric>you're doing.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6842-0
00:54:42.438 --> 00:54:44.198
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the most important thing.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6845-0
00:54:45.848 --> 00:54:46.008
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6851-0
00:54:46.008 --> 00:54:48.008
<v Hou, Eric>So then the data is there and then.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6858-0
00:54:49.728 --> 00:54:51.408
<v Hou, Eric>And LL Ms. are there.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6864-0
00:54:51.408 --> 00:54:53.808
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can have the user no issues.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6866-0
00:54:55.368 --> 00:54:55.688
<v Hou, Eric>No coding.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6869-0
00:55:01.608 --> 00:55:02.448
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys code?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6875-0
00:55:04.928 --> 00:55:06.768
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, I mean, do you guys?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6911-0
00:55:08.328 --> 00:55:11.622
<v Hou, Eric>I mean,
how do I say do you guys go yes or no?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6911-1
00:55:11.622 --> 00:55:16.248
<v Hou, Eric>If you read those codes that AI send back
to you, you understand,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6911-2
00:55:16.248 --> 00:55:21.925
<v Hou, Eric>though what those codes are doing that
mean you can you can you can be confident</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6911-3
00:55:21.925 --> 00:55:24.168
<v Hou, Eric>to say yes if you don't you can.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6916-0
00:55:24.168 --> 00:55:24.408
<v Hou, Eric>Say no.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6928-0
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:28.408
<v Hou, Eric>So how many of you really know how to
code, especially in Python?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6933-0
00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:31.948

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:38.598
<v Hou, Eric>So a lot of folks can call in Python.
I hope you guys are not in the same group.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6953-0
00:55:41.318 --> 00:55:41.838

00:55:48.368 --> 00:55:55.364
<v Hou, Eric>So since some of folks can some of the
folks may not do you guys know how to use</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6979-1
00:55:55.364 --> 00:55:55.968
<v Hou, Eric>GitHub?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6982-0
00:56:00.388 --> 00:56:00.908

<v Hou, Eric>OK,
so I will show you there is something I</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/6996-1
00:56:05.508 --> 00:56:07.438

00:56:19.178 --> 00:56:19.778
<v Hou, Eric>Let me see.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7015-0
00:56:25.748 --> 00:56:27.908
<v Hou, Eric>So like what I said we need.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7022-0
00:56:37.238 --> 00:56:41.358
<v Hou, Eric>We need teams so then I will consider.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7033-0
00:56:44.198 --> 00:56:52.438
<v Hou, Eric>I will considered the hub is definitely a
good tool for you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7055-0
00:56:57.928 --> 00:57:03.596
<v Hou, Eric>For you guys to manage your calls because
in case there is more than one folks in</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7055-1
00:57:03.596 --> 00:57:08.088
<v Hou, Eric>your team gonna call together with other
folks at the same time.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7068-0
00:57:08.648 --> 00:57:12.568
<v Hou, Eric>So you guys need to figure out how you
guys gonna push the changes?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7076-0
00:57:12.568 --> 00:57:15.168
<v Hou, Eric>How you guys gonna commit the changes,
right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7078-0
00:57:15.168 --> 00:57:17.008
<v Hou, Eric>So the GitHub will be a great tool.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7101-0
00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:24.022
<v Hou, Eric>And GitHub has the code space and then
I'll show you so then so that you have</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7101-1
00:57:24.022 --> 00:57:27.448
<v Hou, Eric>you have a virtual machine so that you
can play.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7103-0
00:57:27.758 --> 00:57:28.558
<v Hou, Eric>Where's the data?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7112-0
00:57:30.128 --> 00:57:31.928
<v Hou, Eric>Or you can use Google collab.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7116-0
00:57:31.928 --> 00:57:33.288
<v Hou, Eric>That's totally fine.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7133-0
00:57:33.648 --> 00:57:37.777
<v Hou, Eric>And some of examples are from Google,
so then you can create a notebooks here</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7133-1
00:57:37.777 --> 00:57:38.888
<v Hou, Eric>over there on Google.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7143-0
00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:41.968
<v Hou, Eric>So then this definitely give you a
virtual machine to play around with.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7168-0
00:57:42.368 --> 00:57:47.175
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can definitely start coding
and I'll show you the really good</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7168-1
00:57:47.175 --> 00:57:51.008
<v Hou, Eric>bandwidth of the call lab because they
give you a copilot.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7181-0
00:57:51.008 --> 00:57:55.042
<v Hou, Eric>So then you a lot of cases that you can
just type in a prompt in the copilot and</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7181-1
00:57:55.042 --> 00:57:56.088
<v Hou, Eric>get the code for you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7187-0
00:57:56.758 --> 00:57:58.758
<v Hou, Eric>It's very convenient, OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7190-0
00:57:58.758 --> 00:58:01.238
<v Hou, Eric>I will do that after break.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7198-0
00:58:02.808 --> 00:58:04.408
<v Hou, Eric>AI using a user strategy.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7202-0
00:58:04.408 --> 00:58:05.608
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely yes.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7206-0
00:58:05.608 --> 00:58:07.208
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely use AI.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7219-0
00:58:07.488 --> 00:58:14.228
<v Hou, Eric>Just give me enough transparency that you
use AI that you can say I use AI to do</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7219-1
00:58:14.228 --> 00:58:16.808
<v Hou, Eric>this and and and that'll be it.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7237-0
00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:24.263
<v Hou, Eric>And only Steve for final projects that
you can use AI to generate some good</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7237-1
00:58:24.263 --> 00:58:25.168
<v Hou, Eric>ideas about.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7243-0
00:58:25.248 --> 00:58:28.368
<v Hou, Eric>I just hope that you don't write that
proposal 100%.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7257-0
00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:32.438
<v Hou, Eric>From AA you have to use your input, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7285-0
00:58:32.438 --> 00:58:37.448
<v Hou, Eric>Whatever you wanna achieve and I know
that if you are on a really close</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7285-1
00:58:37.448 --> 00:58:42.945
<v Hou, Eric>something that I I didn't learn and then
you have to use AI to code pieces and</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7285-2
00:58:42.945 --> 00:58:45.798
<v Hou, Eric>then you have to put them together right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7301-0
00:58:45.798 --> 00:58:52.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you wouldn't be able to 100%
rely on AI to code everything.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7305-0
00:58:52.878 --> 00:58:54.958
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's that's.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7309-0
00:58:55.808 --> 00:58:56.128
<v Hou, Eric>That's a caveat.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7327-0
00:58:57.928 --> 00:59:03.607
<v Hou, Eric>So this is everything I wanna talk about
this class as a logistics about this</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7327-1
00:59:03.607 --> 00:59:05.208
<v Hou, Eric>course. Any questions?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7337-0
00:59:09.658 --> 00:59:14.498
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Would there be other deliverables other
than the ones you showed us on?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7360-0
00:59:16.368 --> 00:59:18.659
<v Haroon, Sufyan>On the course schedule for graduate
students?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7360-1
00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:21.648
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Or would they be the same for
undergraduates and graduates?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7403-0
00:59:21.298 --> 00:59:24.297
<v Hou, Eric>So.
So that's why so the undergrad students</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7403-1
00:59:24.297 --> 00:59:27.910
<v Hou, Eric>and grad students,
I hope you do have some undergrad</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7403-2
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:32.341
<v Hou, Eric>students in your group and then I am
envisioning that, you know,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7403-3
00:59:32.341 --> 00:59:35.545

00:59:35.545 --> 00:59:39.498
<v Hou, Eric>And I want the undergrad students to
learn from you guys.</v>

00:59:41.048 --> 00:59:46.052
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe some of the you already have a work,
and then they I want the undergrad learn</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7433-1
00:59:46.052 --> 00:59:48.792
<v Hou, Eric>from you,
not from the knowledge perspective,</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7433-2
00:59:48.792 --> 00:59:52.128

<v Hou, Eric>you guys, from the MBAs,
from from the grad students.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7476-2
01:00:02.054 --> 01:00:08.089
<v Hou, Eric>I want you guys to learn how to lead a
team, how to effectively, you know,</v>

01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:12.998
<v Hou, Eric>effectively communicate with your team
members and then you.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7482-0
01:00:13.398 --> 01:00:17.238

<v Hou, Eric>Everyone has a lot of to take home,
but that's the hope.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7520-0
01:00:35.918 --> 01:00:36.358
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Sounds good.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7531-0
01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:41.852
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, by the way,
maybe you guys know that because I never</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7531-1
01:00:41.852 --> 01:00:42.158
<v Hou, Eric>does.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7540-0
01:00:42.158 --> 01:00:46.278
<v Hou, Eric>Does Marquette really have AB plus policy
that any any policy like that?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7544-0
01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:51.398
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7551-0
01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:52.838
<v Hou, Eric>Well, what is AB plus policy?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7555-0
01:00:53.558 --> 01:00:54.718
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe you do not know that.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7559-0
01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.838
<v Hou, Eric>So the B plus policy is.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7572-0
01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:05.196
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And and in EU Chicago,
no matter how great or not so great your</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7572-1
01:01:05.196 --> 01:01:06.108
<v Hou, Eric>grade is?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7577-0
01:01:07.678 --> 01:01:08.478
<v Hou, Eric>The average.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7583-0
01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.118
<v Hou, Eric>The latter grade of a class has to be B
plus.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7596-0
01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:20.858
<v Hou, Eric>So then the professor gonna adjust the
distributions to make the median B plus.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7602-0
01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:24.038
<v Hou, Eric>Does have that strategy or policy?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7610-0
01:01:25.718 --> 01:01:27.558
<v Weidner, Declan>I don't believe so, but I'm not sure.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7609-0
01:01:27.158 --> 01:01:27.558
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I don't know.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7612-0
01:01:27.278 --> 01:01:27.758
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7624-0
01:01:28.868 --> 01:01:31.643
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yeah,
I've had that on a case by case basis by</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7624-1
01:01:31.643 --> 01:01:32.588
<v Mertens, Aidric>with professors.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7626-0
01:01:33.288 --> 01:01:33.808
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7638-0
01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:39.008
<v Hou, Eric>So it sounds like it may not necessarily
have to BB plus.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7646-0
01:01:39.008 --> 01:01:42.528
<v Hou, Eric>So then we don't have to adjust the
distribution sounds like that.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7648-0
01:01:45.688 --> 01:01:46.168
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7653-0
01:01:47.798 --> 01:01:48.478
<v Hou, Eric>That's good, right?</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7656-0
01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:49.918
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, I'm. I'm I'm. I'm fine with that.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7659-0
01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:52.318
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7660-0
01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:54.438
<v Hou, Eric>All right, so.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7674-0
01:01:56.038 --> 01:01:59.758
<v Hou, Eric>If no one has any question,
let's take a 15 minute break.</v>

dfea9f5a-b57b-42ca-b215-1c58aa7e6fbd/7698-0
