00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:05.566
<v Hou, Eric>You will have to.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/44-0
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:11.486
<v Hou, Eric>You will have to submit your peer review
individually. OK, so this is #1.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/47-0
00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:13.966
<v Hou, Eric>This is definitely not a group work.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/63-0
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:22.126
<v Hou, Eric>You will do your review because your
feedback will affect your peers grade OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/67-0
00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:24.956
<v Hou, Eric>Just be honest. Be objective.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/75-0
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.886
<v Hou, Eric>And be constructive.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/101-0
00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:34.788
<v Hou, Eric>So I want you guys to take 10 to 30
minutes to think about #1 what you have</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/101-1
00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:40.566
<v Hou, Eric>done and #2 what you want your peers to
do in this study group.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/115-0
00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:44.018
<v Hou, Eric>I know there's no study group,
just one single person.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/115-1
00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:45.366
<v Hou, Eric>You have to work with.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/116-0
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:45.926
<v Hou, Eric>Your peers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/126-0
00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:48.686
<v Hou, Eric>You have to work with your group members,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/132-0
00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.086
<v Hou, Eric>So then you think about how you did it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/140-0
00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:53.916
<v Hou, Eric>You think about how the other people did
it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/170-0
00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:58.435
<v Hou, Eric>So there are several criterias and then
there are just.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/170-1
00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:04.641
<v Hou, Eric>Basically provide your team members name,
not you the other peers and give them a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/170-2
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:06.836
<v Hou, Eric>rate to think through, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/174-0
00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:07.916
<v Hou, Eric>So then be fair.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/175-0
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:08.996
<v Hou, Eric>Pick objective.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/186-0
00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:14.556
<v Hou, Eric>I will highly recommend you guys to have
internal group meeting.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/194-0
00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:20.036
<v Hou, Eric>Share your feedback with your group
Members what you think.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/199-0
00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:23.126
<v Hou, Eric>They have been doing great.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/204-0
00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.046
<v Hou, Eric>What you think they have been doing?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/205-0
00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:26.326
<v Hou, Eric>Not so great.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/214-0
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:30.046
<v Hou, Eric>And what you guys can change as a team
together?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/221-0
00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.566
<v Hou, Eric>I understand there's a lot of
difficulties, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/235-0
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:39.476
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're taking so many classes and
and and and this class is not easy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/239-0
00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:40.556
<v Hou, Eric>I understand that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/253-0
00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:47.196
<v Hou, Eric>So then how do you want to make this
group works? Homework so efficient, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/259-0
00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:51.796
<v Hou, Eric>So not necessary like you have to rush to
submit something.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/268-0
00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:54.876
<v Hou, Eric>So just matter,
how do you guys gonna manage time?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/283-0
00:01:55.236 --> 00:02:00.594
<v Hou, Eric>Share your opinion with your peers and
give some constructive feedback to to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/283-1
00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:01.916
<v Hou, Eric>your to your peers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/299-0
00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:09.196
<v Hou, Eric>And also set some expectations for your
final so final projects.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/300-0
00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:11.476
<v Hou, Eric>My experience OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/322-0
00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Hou, Eric>So when I was taking similar class,
machine learning or similar class back to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/322-1
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.185
<v Hou, Eric>my Business School,
the final project's definitely gonna take</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/322-2
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:24.356
<v Hou, Eric>a ton of time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/324-0
00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:26.166
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/367-0
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:32.785
<v Hou, Eric>It's the the reason I don't like as a
student, the final projects is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/367-1
00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.789
<v Hou, Eric>It's not like a final exam.
The final exam,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/367-2
00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:41.319
<v Hou, Eric>just to review everything on the book.
And then you're from your nose. You know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/367-3
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.756
<v Hou, Eric>you're going to have a pretty good grade,
but final projects is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/390-0
00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:50.141
<v Hou, Eric>Some some folks, some your peers,
going to make it really great and some of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/390-1
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Hou, Eric>your peers was like, OK,
I have a lot of exams.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/390-2
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.756
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have some limitations.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/407-0
00:02:54.956 --> 00:03:00.726
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one opportunity that for you
guys going to manage your own project as</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/407-1
00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:02.436
<v Hou, Eric>as as a project manager.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/414-0
00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:04.446
<v Hou, Eric>So so learn how to negotiate.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/453-0
00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:09.826
<v Hou, Eric>Learn how to divide the responsibility to
your peers and yourself,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/453-1
00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Hou, Eric>and learn how to make it more efficient
so that you do not have to spend a lot of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/453-2
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Hou, Eric>time setting up the goals,
setting up the responsibilities or so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/453-3
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.276
<v Hou, Eric>So I I would encourage you guys start
early.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/460-0
00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:25.596
<v Hou, Eric>When when I was in my Business School.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/464-0
00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:26.756
<v Hou, Eric>So then we submit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/470-0
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:29.316
<v Hou, Eric>So we we did exactly the same thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/478-0
00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:30.436
<v Hou, Eric>So how I learn it?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/485-0
00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.996
<v Hou, Eric>Kind of proposal.
Final project kind of structure.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/488-0
00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:34.756
<v Hou, Eric>We didn't have final exam either.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/518-0
00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:41.034
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just need to submit a proposal.
Tell the professor what we to do need to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/518-1
00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Hou, Eric>do and what we found is after one week or
two sub meeting the final proposal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/518-2
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.516
<v Hou, Eric>I we we found.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/525-0
00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:50.196
<v Hou, Eric>Oh my God, we just over promised the goal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/544-0
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:55.922
<v Hou, Eric>It didn't happen to us. So then,
so now we have to change a lot of things</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/544-1
00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:57.326
<v Hou, Eric>and we contact Professor.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/550-0
00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.766
<v Hou, Eric>Hey, we we we think this is not doable.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/555-0
00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:01.086
<v Hou, Eric>We want to change it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/591-0
00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Hou, Eric>We want to change the scope and then you
know if you have such requests.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/591-1
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.919
<v Hou, Eric>I mean all it's totally open after you
and then we can change it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/591-2
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.588
<v Hou, Eric>But you have to plan early.
The reason we changed our scope is we</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/591-3
00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.276
<v Hou, Eric>found that the data is extremely hard.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/617-0
00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:22.977
<v Hou, Eric>To acquire and even though we have,
we have some data from somewhere from we</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/617-1
00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:26.396
<v Hou, Eric>contacted other universities and they
gave us the data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/626-0
00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:30.116
<v Hou, Eric>It just you have to spend too much time
to engineer the data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/629-0
00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:31.246
<v Hou, Eric>It is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/640-0
00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:36.316
<v Hou, Eric>This is not is not even close to to to to
usable so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/645-0
00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:37.556
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's why.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/661-0
00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Hou, Eric>So then you, you,
you you want to start already,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/661-1
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.036
<v Hou, Eric>not definitely don't do it until the last
week.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/675-0
00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Hou, Eric>You you wouldn't have time and and then
you'll need someone to have the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/675-1
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.116
<v Hou, Eric>preparation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/679-0
00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:51.916
<v Hou, Eric>You know, starting from now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/714-0
00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:56.606
<v Hou, Eric>So you have the skeleton of your final
presentation while you are developing and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/714-1
00:04:56.606 --> 00:05:00.018
<v Hou, Eric>developing your tool,
developing your product so you can add</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/714-2
00:05:00.018 --> 00:05:04.156
<v Hou, Eric>more content to that skeleton.
That presentation now be much much easier.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/729-0
00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:12.136
<v Hou, Eric>Then you have one person or two to finish
up that presentation on day -1 OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/766-0
00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:18.078
<v Hou, Eric>And then this is one opportunity you
share your opinion and then this is one</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/766-1
00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:21.614
<v Hou, Eric>opportunity you can manage your group
better in a better way.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/766-2
00:05:21.614 --> 00:05:26.006
<v Hou, Eric>You can manage your final project to have
a great experience in the end. OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/777-0
00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:31.806
<v Hou, Eric>So I don't think you know if you have
only team of three.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/785-0
00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:34.086
<v Hou, Eric>So then you just need to provide the
feedback for the other team.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/801-0
00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:38.684
<v Hou, Eric>You it won't take you more than 5 minutes
to finish this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/801-1
00:05:38.684 --> 00:05:40.716
<v Hou, Eric>but you have to do it right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/805-0
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:42.636
<v Hou, Eric>Think through what you have done.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/823-0
00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:47.887
<v Hou, Eric>What the other people have done and make
your group better and make your group</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/823-1
00:05:47.887 --> 00:05:51.276
<v Hou, Eric>more efficient and and you guys can work
together.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/829-0
00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:55.326
<v Hou, Eric>Towards the the final final project, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/838-0
00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:59.726
<v Hou, Eric>Any any question around this and this
peer review?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/841-0
00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:10.996
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/847-0
00:06:11.156 --> 00:06:12.996
<v Hou, Eric>No questions, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/854-0
00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:16.476
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's actually open in the what's
the name?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/857-0
00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:17.996
<v Hou, Eric>D2L now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/862-0
00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:26.246
<v Hou, Eric>What we are going to do today?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/881-0
00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:33.646
<v Hou, Eric>So we have the first thing is we have
talked about all the tree models, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/895-0
00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:38.217
<v Hou, Eric>So now I want to give you one example.
Going through all the tree models you can</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/895-1
00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:39.966
<v Hou, Eric>see the result of this example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/902-0
00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.556
<v Hou, Eric>I think this is pretty good exercise to
do, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/909-0
00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:46.516
<v Hou, Eric>So then we're gonna go deep,
dive into the data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/930-0
00:06:46.836 --> 00:06:52.179
<v Hou, Eric>So then you eventually gonna use a tree
model for for for your project at work,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/930-1
00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.516
<v Hou, Eric>and then for for for your homework.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/955-0
00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:58.908
<v Hou, Eric>So so we can just go through everything
about tree models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/955-1
00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:03.878
<v Hou, Eric>We gonna close tree models,
and then we gonna cover the time series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/955-2
00:07:03.878 --> 00:07:06.436
<v Hou, Eric>models today and ssvm models today.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/980-0
00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:10.523
<v Hou, Eric>So then I know till next week is a spring
break.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/980-1
00:07:10.523 --> 00:07:14.067
<v Hou, Eric>So then we do not have any class tomorrow
next week.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/980-2
00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:16.876
<v Hou, Eric>So that I hope I can cover all the models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/986-0
00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:20.406
<v Hou, Eric>Before neural network before spring break.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1000-0
00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:26.683
<v Hou, Eric>So then after spring break,
we'll be talking about neural networks</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1000-1
00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:28.526
<v Hou, Eric>and the large language models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1018-0
00:07:30.126 --> 00:07:33.895
<v Hou, Eric>So if you so then I just want you to
finish those conventional machine</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1018-1
00:07:33.895 --> 00:07:35.806
<v Hou, Eric>learning models before spring break.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1054-0
00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:39.480
<v Hou, Eric>After that,
you know neural network is definitely</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1054-1
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.031
<v Hou, Eric>going to be more advanced models,
and then it's it's going to be if you see</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1054-2
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:47.924
<v Hou, Eric>that for three models,
we can actually see the model code and go</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1054-3
00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:51.876
<v Hou, Eric>see the model for neural networks you you
wouldn't be able to do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1059-0
00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.556
<v Hou, Eric>That it's it's it's a black box.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1097-0
00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:59.867
<v Hou, Eric>And then whenever you have to build those
black box from scratch and then you have</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1097-1
00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:02.723
<v Hou, Eric>to learn how the piece is going to work
together.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1097-2
00:08:02.723 --> 00:08:06.665
<v Hou, Eric>So it would definitely be more fun,
but definitely more challenging,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1097-3
00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:10.721
<v Hou, Eric>more more, more math involved.
But hopefully we're going to go through</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1097-4
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:11.006
<v Hou, Eric>that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1108-0
00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:13.606
<v Hou, Eric>And then you gonna you gonna you gonna
see a lot of a new model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1126-0
00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:19.336
<v Hou, Eric>Of course they're happening recently,
right for the for those of tree models,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1126-1
00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:22.556
<v Hou, Eric>at least you have like 10 years of a
history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1135-0
00:08:24.126 --> 00:08:27.486
<v Hou, Eric>Ten years of a history for some of them.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1136-0
00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:28.366
<v Hou, Eric>Your network models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1145-0
00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:31.086
<v Hou, Eric>You do not do not have that history, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1161-0
00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:34.560
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just talk about all of the tree
models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1161-1
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.246
<v Hou, Eric>So as as you can see I'm I'm using the
regression model as example, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1173-0
00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:44.606
<v Hou, Eric>So then from here you can see I'm loading,
so I'm importing so many libraries.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1186-0
00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:48.246
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just just talk through what those
libraries are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1199-0
00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:52.691
<v Hou, Eric>So then pandas and this is really like
the data frame library we're using, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1199-1
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:53.446
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1205-0
00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:55.446
<v Hou, Eric>And this this map file.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1217-0
00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:59.020
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a library that you just,
you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1217-1
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.836
<v Hou, Eric>just plot this pictures and then we use
it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1230-0
00:09:03.406 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Hou, Eric>And then Numpy is already a a library
dealing with a list of numbers and a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1230-1
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.446
<v Hou, Eric>seaborn.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1236-0
00:09:10.206 --> 00:09:12.886
<v Hou, Eric>Is A is a Utd library basically.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1245-0
00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:19.886
<v Hou, Eric>And and I'm really loading a lot of
regression models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1267-0
00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:29.766
<v Hou, Eric>So I I loaded the linear regression model,
so I also loaded the KN model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1284-0
00:09:29.916 --> 00:09:36.476
<v Hou, Eric>I loaded a simple decision tree model and
then here is a random forest regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1302-0
00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:41.721
<v Hou, Eric>So this is this is the model using random
forest and then I loaded a gradient</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1302-1
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:45.039
<v Hou, Eric>boosting model.
I I loaded a utility function called</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1302-2
00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:45.916
<v Hou, Eric>create search.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1348-0
00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:53.484
<v Hou, Eric>And and also I'm so as you can see all
different models are from and also I I I</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1348-1
00:09:53.484 --> 00:09:59.751
<v Hou, Eric>loaded aster boosting model from S3 boost
and also there are some utility functions</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1348-2
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.586
<v Hou, Eric>for example like the train test speed.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1352-0
00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:04.436
<v Hou, Eric>Oh,
I don't think I just need to do this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1352-1
00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:04.696
<v Hou, Eric>again.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1378-0
00:10:07.946 --> 00:10:13.681
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then I loaded some function
to calculate MSR MSE or or maybe the mean</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1378-1
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.546
<v Hou, Eric>absolute percentage errors?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1407-0
00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:20.479
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the metrics that you're
going to quantify the prediction and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1407-1
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:24.495
<v Hou, Eric>versus versus actual.
So going to give you how big the error is,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1407-2
00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:24.866
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1417-0
00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.866
<v Hou, Eric>And also I'm loading this Utd function or
Utd.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1436-0
00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:33.354
<v Hou, Eric>This Utd function is basically encoder
and I'll tell you what encoder is and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1436-1
00:10:33.354 --> 00:10:35.136
<v Hou, Eric>another utility function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1453-0
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:39.972
<v Hou, Eric>Calendar is basically counting of that
different iterations and and of course</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1453-1
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.336
<v Hou, Eric>map math functions so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1494-0
00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:46.816
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm just basically loading all the
functions from different libraries.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1494-1
00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:50.399
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
last week we talked about a lot of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1494-2
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:54.122
<v Hou, Eric>mathematics,
a lot of background of how those models</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1494-3
00:10:54.122 --> 00:10:57.495
<v Hou, Eric>have been developed or coded,
but in real life,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1494-4
00:10:57.495 --> 00:11:00.656
<v Hou, Eric>when you are actually using those models
it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1499-0
00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:01.536
<v Hou, Eric>Just simple lines of code.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1517-0
00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:06.523
<v Hou, Eric>We we talk, you know,
one hour about the gradient boosting,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1517-1
00:11:06.523 --> 00:11:09.616
<v Hou, Eric>but here you just simple like one line of
code.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1532-0
00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:13.242
<v Hou, Eric>You know that the developers,
the Python developers,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1532-1
00:11:13.242 --> 00:11:16.816
<v Hou, Eric>already have those mathematics
implemented behind scenes.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1538-0
00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:19.176
<v Hou, Eric>So then you do not have to do that, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1573-0
00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:24.670
<v Hou, Eric>So you can just call the function and use
it which is which is, which is awesome.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1573-1
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.155
<v Hou, Eric>In the early days you may have to call it
yourself,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1573-2
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:33.314
<v Hou, Eric>but now you don't the data set I'm using
to demonstrate is the use the cars.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1573-3
00:11:33.314 --> 00:11:35.056
<v Hou, Eric>The data set we have seen.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1577-0
00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:36.176
<v Hou, Eric>Before, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1582-0
00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:39.776
<v Hou, Eric>So this data set has different.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1617-0
00:11:41.426 --> 00:11:46.444
<v Hou, Eric>Different information. For example,
you definitely have the brand information</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1617-1
00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:51.397
<v Hou, Eric>telling us if that user card is a Ford
car is a Hyundai car, is a Lexus car,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1617-2
00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:55.256
<v Hou, Eric>and what kind of model.
And then this board car is utility.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1626-0
00:11:56.946 --> 00:12:00.266
<v Hou, Eric>Interceptor base is equal another one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1629-0
00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:01.986
<v Hou, Eric>Infinity is a hybrid sport.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1660-0
00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:07.111
<v Hou, Eric>And also the data also tells us the model
year.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1660-1
00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:12.720
<v Hou, Eric>The first one is 2013 and the few time
some of the gasoline car and some of the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1660-2
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.066
<v Hou, Eric>Hybruary car and those are some
description about the engine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1669-0
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:22.106
<v Hou, Eric>And the transmission external color and
the internal color.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1701-0
00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:27.761
<v Hou, Eric>And also whether or not a car has any
accident,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1701-1
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:33.536
<v Hou, Eric>as because the first Ford car already
like for for police officers at least one</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1701-2
00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:36.496
<v Hou, Eric>accident reported, that's understandable.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1726-0
00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:43.295
<v Hou, Eric>Some of them do not have any report
reported accident and whether or not that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1726-1
00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:50.616
<v Hou, Eric>car has a clean title and then also we do
have the price of those used cars, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1728-0
00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:51.776
<v Hou, Eric>So now we are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1736-0
00:12:51.776 --> 00:12:55.616
<v Hou, Eric>We're seeing we're seeing different
features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1746-0
00:12:56.056 --> 00:13:01.816
<v Hou, Eric>So the model year is definitely treated
as an integer, and all the other.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1756-0
00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.626
<v Hou, Eric>Piece of information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1767-0
00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:11.462
<v Hou, Eric>They're considered as object,
meaning those are characteristics even</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1767-1
00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:14.506
<v Hou, Eric>for the price, and also the mileage.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1792-0
00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:22.884
<v Hou, Eric>So the first thing as we you know the
same thing we did last time is because of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1792-1
00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:26.066
<v Hou, Eric>this dollar sign in this price column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1805-0
00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:29.866
<v Hou, Eric>I just want to gather it up,
this dollar sign and convert this price</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1805-1
00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:30.506
<v Hou, Eric>to a number.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1812-0
00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:33.736
<v Hou, Eric>So that's exactly what I did here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1825-0
00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Hou, Eric>So I got rid of that dollar sign from
that column and it converted to a float.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1825-1
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.856
<v Hou, Eric>A float is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1827-0
00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:42.706
<v Hou, Eric>A number.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1837-0
00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:47.426
<v Hou, Eric>And then it allows you know different
sends.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1844-0
00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:51.346
<v Hou, Eric>So it's definitely not a whole dollar
number.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1862-0
00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:55.765
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then I just converted to a float and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1862-1
00:13:55.765 --> 00:14:00.816
<v Hou, Eric>also I I I got rid of those miles unit in
this mileage.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1879-0
00:14:02.386 --> 00:14:07.097
<v Hou, Eric>Column so then I also converted to a
float to a float,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1879-1
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.666
<v Hou, Eric>float for to to these numbers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1893-0
00:14:11.306 --> 00:14:14.498
<v Hou, Eric>That's basically what I did in those two
rows,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1893-1
00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:17.146
<v Hou, Eric>2 lines of code right after I did that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1913-0
00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:21.565
<v Hou, Eric>I just create a mileage number and a
price number,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1913-1
00:14:21.565 --> 00:14:27.746
<v Hou, Eric>so I just dropped the original mileage
and price columns right so then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1923-0
00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:32.576
<v Hou, Eric>And and also I got rid of some anomalies.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1928-0
00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:35.946
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just keep those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1941-0
00:14:37.826 --> 00:14:44.237
<v Hou, Eric>Price within $300,
000 and then also the mileage less than</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1941-1
00:14:44.237 --> 00:14:45.106
<v Hou, Eric>250,000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1956-0
00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:51.224
<v Hou, Eric>Miles and also I I made the assumption
that the price and the mileage has to be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1956-1
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:51.986
<v Hou, Eric>bigger than 0.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1971-0
00:14:51.986 --> 00:14:57.306
<v Hou, Eric>So then I I don't pay my customer for
them to quote unco buy my cars.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1972-0
00:14:57.306 --> 00:14:58.306
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1979-0
00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.826
<v Hou, Eric>So then get rid of those anomalies.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1989-0
00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:07.786
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm only losing less than 50 records.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/1994-0
00:15:07.786 --> 00:15:10.226
<v Hou, Eric>So before I have a two 4009.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2012-0
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:17.386
<v Hou, Eric>Cars.
Now I have 3966 cars as my training data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2019-0
00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:20.026
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is the data gonna look like.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2030-0
00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:22.866
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have a price as a number and a
mileage as a number.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2034-0
00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:26.666
<v Hou, Eric>All the other,
all the others are are really.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2040-0
00:15:29.786 --> 00:15:31.306
<v Hou, Eric>Characteristics strings.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2058-0
00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:35.354
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then I just plot this chart so the X</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2058-1
00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:39.016
<v Hou, Eric>axis is a mileage and the Y axis is the
price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2059-0
00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:40.336
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2074-0
00:15:41.906 --> 00:15:46.863
<v Hou, Eric>There is no linear relationship between
the mileage and enterprise as you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2074-1
00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:47.986
<v Hou, Eric>You can see this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2089-0
00:15:50.426 --> 00:15:54.582
<v Hou, Eric>Certainly,
the more mileage you put on a car,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2089-1
00:15:54.582 --> 00:15:58.196
<v Hou, Eric>the last price in the car will be right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2103-0
00:15:58.196 --> 00:16:02.050
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then the the price the, the,
the,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2103-1
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.156
<v Hou, Eric>the price declines as the the mileage
increases?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2109-0
00:16:07.706 --> 00:16:08.786
<v Hou, Eric>That's for sure.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2123-0
00:16:08.786 --> 00:16:13.314
<v Hou, Eric>But you do have for for for a simple,
for the same mileage,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2123-1
00:16:13.314 --> 00:16:16.106
<v Hou, Eric>you have a lease up prize over there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2139-0
00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:21.131
<v Hou, Eric>So then they should be explained by the
other information saying brand say</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2139-1
00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:24.146
<v Hou, Eric>different engine say different
transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2168-0
00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:30.483
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically how how you gonna
visualize the data and how the mileage</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2168-1
00:16:30.483 --> 00:16:34.263
<v Hou, Eric>enterprise gonna look like.
And then you can definitely plot this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2168-2
00:16:34.263 --> 00:16:36.096
<v Hou, Eric>chart between other information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2176-0
00:16:36.376 --> 00:16:39.736
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I plot is between mileage and
price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2182-0
00:16:39.736 --> 00:16:42.256
<v Hou, Eric>Just you know,
because there's only two columns are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2188-0
00:16:43.826 --> 00:16:45.986
<v Hou, Eric>Numerical. The other are sort of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2194-0
00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:50.146
<v Hou, Eric>List of strings right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2195-0
00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:53.666
<v Hou, Eric>So we will do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2203-0
00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:57.586
<v Hou, Eric>A stab called feature engineering.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2206-0
00:16:58.186 --> 00:16:59.506
<v Hou, Eric>So I will.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2225-0
00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:05.453
<v Hou, Eric>I will tell you what how I did it and
I'll show you why the feature engineering</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2225-1
00:17:05.453 --> 00:17:07.386
<v Hou, Eric>is so powerful in the end.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2227-0
00:17:08.076 --> 00:17:08.636
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2228-0
00:17:08.876 --> 00:17:09.756
<v Hou, Eric>So for example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2237-0
00:17:14.146 --> 00:17:15.546
<v Hou, Eric>This accident, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2239-0
00:17:15.546 --> 00:17:18.226
<v Hou, Eric>So that I'm basically checking.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2252-0
00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:26.346
<v Hou, Eric>How many different why use in that
accident column?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2267-0
00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:34.984
<v Hou, Eric>So then what I found is there are only
three values in the accident column,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2267-1
00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:38.266
<v Hou, Eric>three unique values. Let me just.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2270-0
00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:40.866
<v Hou, Eric>Rerun it OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2277-0
00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:52.206
<v Hou, Eric>Show you what those three unique values
are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2300-0
00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:19.328
<v Hou, Eric>So those values are really at least one
accident or damage reported non reported</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2300-1
00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:20.496
<v Hou, Eric>or non reported.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2324-0
00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:26.131
<v Hou, Eric>So basically those are the three values
and if you check brand how many different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2324-1
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:31.216
<v Hou, Eric>brands we're talking about in this data
set, we see 56 and what are they?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2337-0
00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:35.449
<v Hou, Eric>You can clearly see those are the major
brand and we have seen in the US market,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2337-1
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:35.736
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2340-0
00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.536
<v Hou, Eric>So then, not so many.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2352-0
00:18:38.466 --> 00:18:41.586
<v Hou, Eric>And then also you can check how many
different external colors we have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2363-0
00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:46.991
<v Hou, Eric>SO3312.
And then you can see what those colors</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2363-1
00:18:46.991 --> 00:18:47.386
<v Hou, Eric>are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2365-0
00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:48.666
<v Hou, Eric>I didn't change it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2372-0
00:18:51.486 --> 00:18:53.086
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the colors.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2386-0
00:18:53.486 --> 00:19:00.006
<v Hou, Eric>So I still consider all of 4000 Colors
three 312 external colors.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2400-0
00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:06.170
<v Hou, Eric>It is not too many,
so this is the way how I engineer the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2400-1
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.126
<v Hou, Eric>features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2404-0
00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:11.766
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm using this encoder function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2407-0
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:15.006
<v Hou, Eric>So I converted those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2414-0
00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:19.386
<v Hou, Eric>Different characteristic values into
numbers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2419-0
00:19:20.816 --> 00:19:23.496
<v Hou, Eric>So so after I do this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2424-0
00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:25.946
<v Hou, Eric>You can see that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2434-0
00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:31.026
<v Hou, Eric>My accident encoded is not going to be.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2442-0
00:19:32.746 --> 00:19:35.626
<v Hou, Eric>You know more than one accident reported.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2471-0
00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:40.694
<v Hou, Eric>It's going to be like zero and one,
and then also my my external color gonna</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2471-1
00:19:40.694 --> 00:19:44.907
<v Hou, Eric>be a different numbers,
some numbers assigned to those to those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2471-2
00:19:44.907 --> 00:19:46.026
<v Hou, Eric>different colors.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2475-0
00:19:46.466 --> 00:19:49.306
<v Hou, Eric>So that's how I manage to have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2484-0
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:53.016
<v Hou, Eric>Those column encoded.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2485-0
00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:56.336
<v Hou, Eric>So basically I'm converting those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2498-0
00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:02.946
<v Hou, Eric>Characteristic or categorical values into
numbers OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2508-0
00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Hou, Eric>But some of those column,
for example transmission umm if you check</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2508-1
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.616
<v Hou, Eric>the transmission column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2515-0
00:20:12.506 --> 00:20:15.626
<v Hou, Eric>OK, it's not too bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2524-0
00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:20.656
<v Hou, Eric>But if you take look if you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2542-0
00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:25.003
<v Hou, Eric>If you take a look at this transmission
column,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2542-1
00:20:25.003 --> 00:20:30.136
<v Hou, Eric>you can actually see there are some
common patterns, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2554-0
00:20:30.416 --> 00:20:33.296
<v Hou, Eric>So you can see there are some 7 speed Ant.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2561-0
00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:36.416
<v Hou, Eric>There's a speed Ant.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2570-0
00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:43.296
<v Hou, Eric>There's 10 speed an T or or 9 speeds AAT.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2577-0
00:20:43.296 --> 00:20:45.776
<v Hou, Eric>So I I Google it because I'm not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2582-0
00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:47.786
<v Hou, Eric>Really familiar with the car.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2587-0
00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:49.746
<v Hou, Eric>So now what does this mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2592-0
00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:51.786
<v Hou, Eric>It's automatic transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2593-0
00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:53.306
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2606-0
00:20:53.346 --> 00:20:57.492
<v Hou, Eric>This really telling you that the seven
speed automatic transmission is also</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2606-1
00:20:57.492 --> 00:20:58.746
<v Hou, Eric>automatic transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2614-0
00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:03.146
<v Hou, Eric>You can certainly see a lot of
information that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2623-0
00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:08.786
<v Hou, Eric>In the same pattern across all different
values of transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2636-0
00:21:10.466 --> 00:21:13.706
<v Hou, Eric>So this is what I did for now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2655-0
00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:23.229
<v Hou, Eric>Transmission column.
So I found out of 4000 about 4000 rows.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2655-1
00:21:23.229 --> 00:21:28.536
<v Hou, Eric>This A and T showed up 2417 times.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2658-0
00:21:30.106 --> 00:21:31.306
<v Hou, Eric>These 6 speed.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2692-0
00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:41.608
<v Hou, Eric>Showed up 694 times and those are these
automatic shows of a 688 times and eight</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2692-1
00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:47.946
<v Hou, Eric>speed and transmission and withdual and
shift in mode and.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2701-0
00:21:49.826 --> 00:21:51.306
<v Hou, Eric>M-T and seven speed.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2722-0
00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:57.932
<v Hou, Eric>So definitely you can see there are a lot
of high frequent word showing up across</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2722-1
00:21:57.932 --> 00:22:00.216
<v Hou, Eric>different values of transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2731-0
00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:06.296
<v Hou, Eric>So instead I'm just encode this entire
transmission column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2732-0
00:22:06.896 --> 00:22:07.776
<v Hou, Eric>I decide.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2736-0
00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:07.856
<v Haroon, Sufyan>The muscles.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2738-0
00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:09.856
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Any question?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2751-0
00:22:12.236 --> 00:22:18.236
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So this code you have for the word count
is it case sensitive or does it?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2774-0
00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:24.731
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Would it would if I have one thing in a
capital M and a one or and a let's say</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2774-1
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:25.106
<v Haroon, Sufyan>model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2790-0
00:22:25.306 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Haroon, Sufyan>I have model the word model.
There one one's in a capital M and one's</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2790-1
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.706
<v Haroon, Sufyan>in a lower M.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2802-0
00:22:30.986 --> 00:22:35.626
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Would it show it twice,
or would it just show model as as one?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2804-0
00:22:36.286 --> 00:22:38.486
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, you see this lower function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2822-0
00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:43.146
<v Hou, Eric>This lower function will convert
everything into lowercase.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2818-0
00:22:44.226 --> 00:22:44.826
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2825-0
00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:45.466
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Thank you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2832-0
00:22:45.836 --> 00:22:50.036
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So as you can see,
I have a AA-T here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2836-0
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:51.316
<v Hou, Eric>So that is, I don't see that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2862-0
00:22:51.316 --> 00:22:55.537
<v Hou, Eric>So I only see this so then I convert
everything and the 6 speed.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2862-1
00:22:55.537 --> 00:23:00.668
<v Hou, Eric>If you can see there is 6 speed like this.
So this lower function will convert</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2862-2
00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:02.356
<v Hou, Eric>everything to a lowercase.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2866-0
00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:04.036
<v Hou, Eric>There's no capital letters.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2872-0
00:23:04.556 --> 00:23:07.676
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully I don't see that there's no
capital letters in there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2880-0
00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:09.636
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's how I counted it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2899-0
00:23:09.636 --> 00:23:13.562
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a legit question.
Say I have a 6 speed in capital case and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2899-1
00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:16.725
<v Hou, Eric>there are 6 speed in lower case,
but they'd you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2899-2
00:23:16.725 --> 00:23:18.776
<v Hou, Eric>consider those are different cases.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2918-0
00:23:20.176 --> 00:23:23.877
<v Hou, Eric>You,
you I will highly recommend you guys to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2918-1
00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:28.976
<v Hou, Eric>lower either you know no to be to make
them pace insensitive.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2925-0
00:23:30.866 --> 00:23:33.666
<v Hou, Eric>I mean this data in,
in my opinion isn't bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2943-0
00:23:35.386 --> 00:23:38.820
<v Hou, Eric>I have seen in my previous work.
You know I'm working with different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2943-1
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.666
<v Hou, Eric>companies, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2946-0
00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:43.506
<v Hou, Eric>So then just a A real story.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2959-0
00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:47.906
<v Hou, Eric>A real story. I I I work for AUS company,
headquartered in us.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2971-0
00:23:48.746 --> 00:23:51.652
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not going to tell you what our
company is,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2971-1
00:23:51.652 --> 00:23:54.186
<v Hou, Eric>what I'm going to tell you in their very.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2973-0
00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:56.106
<v Hou, Eric>Sales data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2977-0
00:23:57.496 --> 00:23:58.496
<v Hou, Eric>I have seen.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2983-0
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:02.866
<v Hou, Eric>16 versions of United States.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2991-0
00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:06.226
<v Hou, Eric>I have seen us.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/2999-0
00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:10.026
<v Hou, Eric>I've seen Usai have seen United States.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3008-0
00:24:10.346 --> 00:24:16.226
<v Hou, Eric>I have seen United State,
I have seen United States, so there's.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3026-0
00:24:18.266 --> 00:24:22.911
<v Hou, Eric>There's there's so many different,
very creative way of spelling United</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3026-1
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:24.266
<v Hou, Eric>States in their data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3042-0
00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:29.682
<v Hou, Eric>So at least this lower function can get
rid of, you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3042-1
00:24:29.682 --> 00:24:32.886
<v Hou, Eric>the higher you know sensitive case kind
of issue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3051-0
00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:39.586
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
So then in in this way you can extract.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3067-0
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:46.466
<v Hou, Eric>I extract the most common 20 words and
you do not have to do 20.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3068-0
00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:47.386
<v Hou, Eric>You can do 10.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3073-0
00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:48.746
<v Hou, Eric>You can do more than 20.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3077-0
00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:50.866
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I see 20 is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3092-0
00:24:52.706 --> 00:24:54.266
<v Hou, Eric>You know, in the end it's automatics.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3100-0
00:24:54.266 --> 00:24:59.026
<v Hou, Eric>There's only 12 frequency and technique.
I don't have to do 20.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3101-0
00:24:59.026 --> 00:24:59.826
<v Hou, Eric>I can do 10.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3112-0
00:24:59.826 --> 00:25:07.146
<v Hou, Eric>That's good enough and and and and is
this extraction the best way?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3113-0
00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:08.546
<v Hou, Eric>Of course not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3122-0
00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:11.826
<v Hou, Eric>I can tell you now it is not the best way.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3136-0
00:25:12.826 --> 00:25:20.446
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is you know I Google it and
this at means automatic transmission.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3137-0
00:25:21.856 --> 00:25:25.696
<v Hou, Eric>And I see automatic here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3150-0
00:25:27.266 --> 00:25:30.543
<v Hou, Eric>In the best case scenario,
this automatic and this should be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3150-1
00:25:30.543 --> 00:25:31.026
<v Hou, Eric>combined.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3158-0
00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:34.546
<v Hou, Eric>Right. And also this transmission here?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3178-0
00:25:34.546 --> 00:25:38.832
<v Hou, Eric>Hey I'm extracting information from this
transmission column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3178-1
00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:42.426
<v Hou, Eric>Of course I should see transmission as a
word here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3201-0
00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:48.143
<v Hou, Eric>And then why do I even use transmission
as a feature as a keyword extracted from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3201-1
00:25:48.143 --> 00:25:50.186
<v Hou, Eric>this very transmission column?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3204-0
00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:52.426
<v Hou, Eric>That's a very valid question.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3208-0
00:25:53.816 --> 00:25:55.696
<v Hou, Eric>And and what I see in here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3213-0
00:25:57.266 --> 00:25:58.426
<v Hou, Eric>Is also another automatic.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3220-0
00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:00.386
<v Hou, Eric>It's a menu.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3229-0
00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:04.866
<v Hou, Eric>I'm pretty sure this Mt means manual
transmission, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3242-0
00:26:04.866 --> 00:26:10.786
<v Hou, Eric>And I I also see with I mean this with
sounds feels like it's a fader word.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3250-0
00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:15.586
<v Hou, Eric>So this is definitely not the best way.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3263-0
00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:21.386
<v Hou, Eric>Is far from a pass away to extract
information from this transmission column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3270-0
00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:26.556
<v Hou, Eric>I acknowledge that,
but I could show you that even this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3289-0
00:26:28.106 --> 00:26:34.246
<v Hou, Eric>This way of extracting information from
all the data you have gonna provide you a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3289-1
00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:36.866
<v Hou, Eric>powerful information in your model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3311-0
00:26:37.186 --> 00:26:41.242
<v Hou, Eric>So the point is,
isn't far from being perfect,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3311-1
00:26:41.242 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Hou, Eric>but still very valuable for a model. OK,
and and you have a big enough room to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3311-2
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.786
<v Hou, Eric>make it even better.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3318-0
00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:55.356
<v Hou, Eric>So I extract 20 common words from here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3329-0
00:26:56.906 --> 00:27:01.146
<v Hou, Eric>And I made each word 01 column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3335-0
00:27:01.826 --> 00:27:05.426
<v Hou, Eric>So that's exactly what I did from OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3342-0
00:27:06.186 --> 00:27:11.386
<v Hou, Eric>So after I do this I can show you the new
data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3344-0
00:27:11.626 --> 00:27:12.946
<v Hou, Eric>How the new data looks like?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3361-0
00:27:16.266 --> 00:27:21.506
<v Hou, Eric>So you see,
I have this transmission 10 speed, 0 ones.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3369-0
00:27:22.586 --> 00:27:27.386
<v Hou, Eric>There's a transmission 5 speed zero and
ones guess I I I own.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3379-0
00:27:31.676 --> 00:27:33.156
<v Hou, Eric>You should let me see this one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3400-0
00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:37.318
<v Hou, Eric>Transformation 5. Speed.
Oh I I got rid of this transmission</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3400-1
00:27:37.318 --> 00:27:40.661
<v Hou, Eric>column,
so let's let me show you some of them to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3400-2
00:27:40.661 --> 00:27:43.936
<v Hou, Eric>make sure that there is definitely some
column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3402-0
00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:45.336
<v Hou, Eric>This this guy is the one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3413-0
00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:52.707
<v Hou, Eric>So the for those cars,
you definitely have transmission 5 speed</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3413-1
00:27:52.707 --> 00:27:53.346
<v Hou, Eric>equals one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3421-0
00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:58.756
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then I also tracked this engine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3427-0
00:27:59.156 --> 00:28:01.796
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you the raw value of the
engine column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3441-0
00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:10.296
<v Hou, Eric>So the engine column has 1126 unique
values.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3445-0
00:28:11.866 --> 00:28:12.586
<v Hou, Eric>And some.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3454-0
00:28:12.786 --> 00:28:16.266
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of engine's gonna.
Description's gonna look like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3471-0
00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:23.596
<v Hou, Eric>Some number of horsepower,
a leader of that engine and a version of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3471-1
00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:24.586
<v Hou, Eric>that engine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3491-0
00:28:24.586 --> 00:28:27.176
<v Hou, Eric>How many cylinder of that engine and and
whatsoever.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3491-1
00:28:27.176 --> 00:28:31.036
<v Hou, Eric>So those kind of information about engine,
you can definitely extract a lot of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3491-2
00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:32.306
<v Hou, Eric>information in my opinion.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3500-0
00:28:34.186 --> 00:28:38.082
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not a super car guy,
but I can still see that so that I decide</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3500-1
00:28:38.082 --> 00:28:38.256
<v Hou, Eric>to.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3520-0
00:28:40.146 --> 00:28:46.806
<v Hou, Eric>Extract top 30 from this so I can see
engine which is definitely an example to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3520-1
00:28:46.806 --> 00:28:47.986
<v Hou, Eric>show you guys.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3529-0
00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:52.106
<v Hou, Eric>This is definitely not the best way to
extract the information signal for sure.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3538-0
00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:56.666
<v Hou, Eric>Feel and some information I can start
seeing is a gasoline.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3554-0
00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:04.590
<v Hou, Eric>And V6 is a different engine kind of
version and then also someone is showing</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3554-1
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.306
<v Hou, Eric>electric.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3570-0
00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Hou, Eric>Someone's showing 3.0 liters,
so definitely gonna sum columns gonna be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3570-1
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.146
<v Hou, Eric>created around this engine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3572-0
00:29:15.976 --> 00:29:16.656
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3575-0
00:29:22.726 --> 00:29:23.606
<v Hou, Eric>After this step.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3597-0
00:29:25.146 --> 00:29:29.785
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you definitely have,
you definitely have these engines 3.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3597-1
00:29:29.785 --> 00:29:31.946
<v Hou, Eric>5 liter, engine, GDI engine turbo.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3604-0
00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:35.626
<v Hou, Eric>So those are gonna be information that
you can use to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3611-0
00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:39.546
<v Hou, Eric>How good or bad a car is?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3615-0
00:29:41.226 --> 00:29:42.186
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is a model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3622-0
00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:46.856
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see what model column has.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3628-0
00:29:53.406 --> 00:29:55.566
<v Hou, Eric>This is basically different models, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3641-0
00:29:55.566 --> 00:30:00.666
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm trying to extract like
similar information from this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3641-1
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:02.366
<v Hou, Eric>so I'll do that. Gosh.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3643-0
00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:07.446
<v Hou, Eric>On that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3675-0
00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:20.939
<v Hou, Eric>So I've seen their submodel is really
base model,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3675-1
00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:24.176
<v Hou, Eric>some of the model we considered a premium
model,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3675-2
00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:29.196
<v Hou, Eric>some of the model we consider like spore
model and then some limited model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3690-0
00:30:30.886 --> 00:30:37.046
<v Hou, Eric>So a lot of information can extract from
the model as well the formatting so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3692-0
00:30:38.646 --> 00:30:38.686
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3705-0
00:30:40.326 --> 00:30:46.646
<v Hou, Eric>I took some time in this feature
engineering stuff, so #1I encoded those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3737-0
00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:54.576
<v Hou, Eric>Columns with a small number of unique
values and #2 is I extract some</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3737-1
00:30:54.576 --> 00:30:58.504
<v Hou, Eric>information.
In my opinion gonna be the key</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3737-2
00:30:58.504 --> 00:31:04.396
<v Hou, Eric>information from transmission from engine
and from model columns.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3743-0
00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:07.076
<v Hou, Eric>So I recreate those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3745-0
00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:09.156
<v Hou, Eric>I recreate those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3753-0
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:13.246
<v Hou, Eric>Column around those information,
so right now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3758-0
00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:16.286
<v Hou, Eric>So how many columns do I have?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3789-0
00:31:20.486 --> 00:31:28.494
<v Hou, Eric>So I have 3966 roles and I have 59
columns and a majority of them are just</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3789-1
00:31:28.494 --> 00:31:34.046
<v Hou, Eric>basically coming from this information
instruction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3800-0
00:31:34.846 --> 00:31:39.646
<v Hou, Eric>So Next up is here is going to be the
total columns I have, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3816-0
00:31:39.646 --> 00:31:45.006
<v Hou, Eric>So now you can open this text editor.
You can see all the columns I have so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3826-0
00:31:45.766 --> 00:31:47.926
<v Hou, Eric>These are definitely the columns I
extract from engine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3842-0
00:31:49.486 --> 00:31:54.945
<v Hou, Eric>And those are the columns I extract from
model and those are the columns from the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3842-1
00:31:54.945 --> 00:31:56.276
<v Hou, Eric>transmission, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3848-0
00:31:58.286 --> 00:31:59.166
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3852-0
00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:02.846
<v Hou, Eric>So I wanna start with just price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3858-0
00:32:02.846 --> 00:32:05.126
<v Hou, Eric>So this is what I'm going to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3863-0
00:32:06.846 --> 00:32:09.326
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just start with the mileage.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3880-0
00:32:12.746 --> 00:32:16.242
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So let's just use one feature and that is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3880-1
00:32:16.242 --> 00:32:19.666
<v Hou, Eric>the mileage and C and compare different
models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3890-0
00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:23.946
<v Hou, Eric>How different models are are are doing so
I have only one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3902-0
00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:26.426
<v Hou, Eric>Why? That's the price. I have only 1X.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3908-0
00:32:26.426 --> 00:32:29.346
<v Hou, Eric>That's the mileage,
and let's see how it goes.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3917-0
00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:35.986
<v Hou, Eric>So I will split the entire data set into
a test and train.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3952-0
00:32:37.526 --> 00:32:44.577
<v Hou, Eric>Where the train will have 80% of the
entire data and then we're going to build</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3952-1
00:32:44.577 --> 00:32:51.984
<v Hou, Eric>a different models on the train data set
to predict the price and we will test how</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3952-2
00:32:51.984 --> 00:32:57.696
<v Hou, Eric>good or bad a model is on the test data
set using the X in the.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3971-0
00:32:57.696 --> 00:33:03.832
<v Hou, Eric>Test data set and predict the price of
the those used cars in the test data set</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3971-1
00:33:03.832 --> 00:33:05.136
<v Hou, Eric>and compare them.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3974-0
00:33:05.496 --> 00:33:07.776
<v Hou, Eric>So that's exactly what I'm going to do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3990-0
00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:15.326
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will have 3172 rows to train
the model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3993-0
00:33:16.046 --> 00:33:17.206
<v Hou, Eric>You have a question please.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/3999-0
00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.156
<v Hou, Eric>And you're on me with her one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4017-0
00:33:20.406 --> 00:33:25.157
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Yeah. Oh, sorry.
I had one question about we plan to do a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4003-0
00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:22.846
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4017-1
00:33:25.157 --> 00:33:28.516
<v Haroon, Sufyan>validation include a validation data set.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4041-0
00:33:30.126 --> 00:33:34.506
<v Haroon, Sufyan>In our in our final project,
would we include that in the?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4034-0
00:33:32.286 --> 00:33:32.766
<v Hou, Eric>Sure.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4041-1
00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:37.326
<v Haroon, Sufyan>So for example you have test size 0.2.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4075-0
00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:43.889
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Would we also include the validation set .
2 and just train the model on .</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4049-0
00:33:37.876 --> 00:33:38.076
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4075-1
00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:45.726
<v Haroon, Sufyan>6 or 60% of the data?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4076-0
00:33:46.376 --> 00:33:47.856
<v Hou, Eric>I I highly recommend you do that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4087-0
00:33:47.856 --> 00:33:50.202
<v Hou, Eric>So you wanna do like a train validation
and test?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4087-1
00:33:50.202 --> 00:33:53.016
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's that's that's even better
than this approach.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4103-0
00:33:54.306 --> 00:33:59.727
<v Haroon, Sufyan>What we define defined or set the
validation set and when we split the data</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4103-1
00:33:59.727 --> 00:34:01.866
<v Haroon, Sufyan>set or what we do it later on?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4125-0
00:34:03.196 --> 00:34:06.707
<v Hou, Eric>You can do it later on,
so you have the train you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4125-1
00:34:06.707 --> 00:34:12.076
<v Hou, Eric>Then you have the freedom to do you then
even 55 fold validation if you want.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4129-0
00:34:11.796 --> 00:34:13.676
<v Haroon, Sufyan>All right, sounds OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4130-0
00:34:12.596 --> 00:34:13.956
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, it's really up to you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4132-0
00:34:14.866 --> 00:34:15.386
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Thank you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4145-0
00:34:15.566 --> 00:34:20.036
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, for sure. For for this.
I didn't do any validation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4158-0
00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:24.915
<v Hou, Eric>I just trained the model on train set and
then test it on test and then whatever</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4158-1
00:34:24.915 --> 00:34:25.156
<v Hou, Eric>the.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4167-0
00:34:26.686 --> 00:34:29.092
<v Hou, Eric>Suggested a good approach.
So then you can do a training and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4167-1
00:34:29.092 --> 00:34:29.526
<v Hou, Eric>validation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4191-0
00:34:31.246 --> 00:34:36.714
<v Hou, Eric>Once one step and then the reason I have
this this step is I do see some error</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4191-1
00:34:36.714 --> 00:34:39.206
<v Hou, Eric>messages if you don't use this step.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4198-0
00:34:39.526 --> 00:34:41.086
<v Hou, Eric>It's really like some of the columns.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4202-0
00:34:41.086 --> 00:34:43.286
<v Hou, Eric>You may have some NA values.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4217-0
00:34:43.286 --> 00:34:48.016
<v Hou, Eric>The null values just I just feel those
null values by using the mean of that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4217-1
00:34:48.016 --> 00:34:48.446
<v Hou, Eric>column.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4231-0
00:34:49.176 --> 00:34:56.696
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really to prevent any any
error from happening. So now we have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4240-0
00:34:58.246 --> 00:35:00.206
<v Hou, Eric>You have the data training data prepared.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4244-0
00:35:00.206 --> 00:35:02.086
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's try different models, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4250-0
00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:04.246
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's try this.
A linear regression model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4258-0
00:35:05.926 --> 00:35:07.126
<v Hou, Eric>So it's pretty easy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4281-0
00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:11.756
<v Hou, Eric>You just define your model's name and
then call this linear model module and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4281-1
00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:15.664
<v Hou, Eric>then you you just say hey,
this LR under score model is a linear</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4281-2
00:35:15.664 --> 00:35:16.686
<v Hou, Eric>regression model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4283-0
00:35:18.156 --> 00:35:19.476
<v Hou, Eric>And then I will fit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4304-0
00:35:21.046 --> 00:35:27.219
<v Hou, Eric>X is X frame and then and then my Y or Y
train. So I gonna fit this model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4304-1
00:35:27.219 --> 00:35:29.606
<v Hou, Eric>I will predict based upon my.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4318-0
00:35:31.286 --> 00:35:36.606
<v Hou, Eric>My input variables in the X task and I
will I will predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4325-0
00:35:38.326 --> 00:35:39.806
<v Hou, Eric>My used car price this call.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4331-0
00:35:39.806 --> 00:35:42.406
<v Hou, Eric>That's my Y under score prediction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4338-0
00:35:44.046 --> 00:35:46.206
<v Hou, Eric>I will compare my prediction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4346-0
00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:50.486
<v Hou, Eric>Versus my test actual price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4353-0
00:35:51.046 --> 00:35:55.006
<v Hou, Eric>So I will calculate mean square error.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4358-0
00:35:55.516 --> 00:35:56.596
<v Hou, Eric>So what does it mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4367-0
00:35:56.596 --> 00:36:02.396
<v Hou, Eric>Square error mean so then I'll have a
prediction. I'll have a actual value.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4372-0
00:36:03.966 --> 00:36:04.406
<v Hou, Eric>I'll do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4386-0
00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:09.066
<v Hou, Eric>I'll calculate the difference between
those two values,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4386-1
00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:11.446
<v Hou, Eric>say my actual car price is 100.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4393-0
00:36:11.446 --> 00:36:14.766
<v Hou, Eric>It is 10,000 and I am predicting.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4404-0
00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:20.726
<v Hou, Eric>11,000 so then or 99000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4418-0
00:36:20.766 --> 00:36:27.476
<v Hou, Eric>My difference is either 1000 or a -, 1000,
but I just don't want to say.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4433-0
00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:31.872
<v Hou, Eric>I just want when the prediction in
between so that I will trade it,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4433-1
00:36:31.872 --> 00:36:33.876
<v Hou, Eric>you know 1000 -, 1000 the same.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4440-0
00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:37.276
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm taking absolute value around
it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4452-0
00:36:37.276 --> 00:36:41.229
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so the actual value is 10 and I'm</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4452-1
00:36:41.229 --> 00:36:42.516
<v Hou, Eric>predicting 11.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4462-0
00:36:42.916 --> 00:36:48.476
<v Hou, Eric>So then my difference is going to be 1000
in here, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4469-0
00:36:48.476 --> 00:36:50.276
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have a 10,000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4473-0
00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:51.676
<v Hou, Eric>I'm predicting 11,000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4476-0
00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.236
<v Hou, Eric>I have another 20,000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4486-0
00:36:53.236 --> 00:36:59.076
<v Hou, Eric>I'm predating 21,000,
so I'm calculating the average of those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4496-0
00:37:00.646 --> 00:37:02.326
<v Hou, Eric>Mis predicted differences.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4503-0
00:37:02.606 --> 00:37:06.406
<v Hou, Eric>So that's how I calculate the mean
absolute error, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4535-0
00:37:06.406 --> 00:37:12.733
<v Hou, Eric>So then and absolute percentage error is
is is doing the following.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4535-1
00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:19.246
<v Hou, Eric>Say I'm my my my used car price is 10,
000 and I'm predicting 11,000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4543-0
00:37:19.526 --> 00:37:22.166
<v Hou, Eric>So I know my difference is only 1000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4550-0
00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:25.526
<v Hou, Eric>I want to convert 1000 into a percentage
value.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4552-0
00:37:26.206 --> 00:37:26.606
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4560-0
00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:27.726
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to do is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4582-0
00:37:27.726 --> 00:37:33.651
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to divide by 1000 by the actual
value, which is 10,000,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4582-1
00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:39.126
<v Hou, Eric>so that I'm telling myself I usually miss
10% of my actuals.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4610-0
00:37:39.646 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Hou, Eric>So then MSE is giving you an absolute
difference between your prediction and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4610-1
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.031
<v Hou, Eric>your actual price,
and the percentage is going to give you a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4610-2
00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:51.686
<v Hou, Eric>percentage difference.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4620-0
00:37:52.486 --> 00:37:58.716
<v Hou, Eric>Both of them are quantifying how big the
prediction error is. OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4626-0
00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:01.846
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm output.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4642-0
00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:10.055
<v Hou, Eric>So then our job using different models is
to minimize the MSE and also minimize the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4642-1
00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:10.446
<v Hou, Eric>map.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4660-0
00:38:11.006 --> 00:38:15.004
<v Hou, Eric>And then if MSE is lower,
map is automatically lower so that you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4660-1
00:38:15.004 --> 00:38:17.526
<v Hou, Eric>can. You can think about this either way.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4668-0
00:38:17.526 --> 00:38:21.006
<v Hou, Eric>So we are just going to minimize both of
those metrics.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4674-0
00:38:22.686 --> 00:38:25.166
<v Hou, Eric>And then I'm going to plot.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4681-0
00:38:26.996 --> 00:38:28.036
<v Hou, Eric>A chart, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4703-0
00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:33.994
<v Hou, Eric>So then X axis still being the the
mileage and the Y axis in blue gonna be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4703-1
00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:38.760
<v Hou, Eric>the actual value,
the Y axis in red gonna be the prediction</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4703-2
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.236
<v Hou, Eric>value.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4742-0
00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Hou, Eric>I just wanna visualize how big the
difference is between the prediction and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4742-1
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:52.402
<v Hou, Eric>actual values and also I'm outputting the
importance of the features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4742-2
00:38:52.402 --> 00:38:59.165
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning what are the top 10 important
factors that will impact my used car</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4742-3
00:38:59.165 --> 00:38:59.706
<v Hou, Eric>price?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4749-0
00:39:00.106 --> 00:39:03.226
<v Hou, Eric>So that's going to be another output from
this model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4751-0
00:39:04.396 --> 00:39:04.956
<v Hou, Eric>So that's it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4762-0
00:39:06.906 --> 00:39:12.506
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see this linear regression
model gave us 80%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4769-0
00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:14.966
<v Hou, Eric>Of map right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4776-0
00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:18.246
<v Hou, Eric>So the map being the the error level,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4784-0
00:39:18.246 --> 00:39:21.846
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's I just want to have
recording.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4786-0
00:39:22.846 --> 00:39:23.886
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do it here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4788-0
00:39:25.686 --> 00:39:25.766
<v Hou, Eric>Using.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4793-0
00:39:30.236 --> 00:39:34.596
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4801-0
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:40.436
<v Hou, Eric>So for linear regression is 80% so
meaning.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4821-0
00:39:42.006 --> 00:39:50.658
<v Hou, Eric>If my actual price is $10,000,
my prediction could be as high as 18 or</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4821-1
00:39:50.658 --> 00:39:52.486
<v Hou, Eric>as low as 2000.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4834-0
00:39:54.206 --> 00:39:58.023
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds like as the number also as the
number suggested is a really poor</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4834-1
00:39:58.023 --> 00:39:58.606
<v Hou, Eric>prediction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4849-0
00:40:00.286 --> 00:40:02.754
<v Hou, Eric>With that expectation,
you can actually see the actual value</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4849-1
00:40:02.754 --> 00:40:03.886
<v Hou, Eric>versus the prediction value.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4862-0
00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:10.716
<v Hou, Eric>It's a line and then a lot of variability
of this price is got ignored.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4870-0
00:40:11.246 --> 00:40:16.366
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a really a weakness of this
linear regression model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4890-0
00:40:17.086 --> 00:40:22.165
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you do have some car here and
then this is really high value is totally</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4890-1
00:40:22.165 --> 00:40:24.246
<v Hou, Eric>going to be ignored by this model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4906-0
00:40:24.806 --> 00:40:28.656
<v Hou, Eric>So that's also suggested by.
That's why you know this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4906-1
00:40:28.656 --> 00:40:31.246
<v Hou, Eric>this percentage error is so high 80%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4923-0
00:40:32.956 --> 00:40:36.920
<v Hou, Eric>And since we have only one feature,
so definitely not mileage,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4923-1
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.436
<v Hou, Eric>mileage is going to be really important.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4929-0
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:41.556
<v Hou, Eric>So let's try KNN.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4950-0
00:40:42.436 --> 00:40:48.248
<v Hou, Eric>So what I'm doing is I'm calling KNN,
so I'm going to calculate the the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4950-1
00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:51.476
<v Hou, Eric>prediction by using 25 neighbors nearby.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4993-0
00:40:51.476 --> 00:40:56.919
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to fit the model and I'm going
to predict and I'm going still going to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4993-1
00:40:56.919 --> 00:41:01.958
<v Hou, Eric>output the the MSE map and prediction as
a chart and also top 10 features,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4993-2
00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:06.796
<v Hou, Eric>but in this way there's only one feature,
there's only one information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/4998-0
00:41:06.796 --> 00:41:09.076
<v Hou, Eric>That's mileage is definitely going to be
very important.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5011-0
00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:14.556
<v Hou, Eric>I see as you can see,
this king is doing much better than</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5011-1
00:41:14.556 --> 00:41:16.136
<v Hou, Eric>linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5017-0
00:41:16.176 --> 00:41:19.576
<v Hou, Eric>So the map is already 58%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5022-0
00:41:19.576 --> 00:41:20.696
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just record it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5025-0
00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.386
<v Hou, Eric>It's 58%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5033-0
00:41:27.076 --> 00:41:30.196
<v Hou, Eric>So then this king is definitely better
than linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5041-0
00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:32.636
<v Hou, Eric>It just reduced the error by 22%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5065-0
00:41:32.636 --> 00:41:36.618
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's a huge improvement.
The reason it got improved,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5065-1
00:41:36.618 --> 00:41:39.572
<v Hou, Eric>you know this is allow the nonlinearity
here,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5065-2
00:41:39.572 --> 00:41:44.196
<v Hou, Eric>at least you do not have one straight
line a lot of points got covered.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5072-0
00:41:44.316 --> 00:41:49.036
<v Hou, Eric>So As for visualization,
you can definitely see it is better.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5080-0
00:41:50.596 --> 00:41:51.836
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try a regression tree.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5092-0
00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:57.906
<v Hou, Eric>This going to be a simple regression tree.
Am I saying a Max that is only is 10?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5116-0
00:41:58.026 --> 00:42:01.648
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm not going to build this tree super,
umm, deep,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5116-1
00:42:01.648 --> 00:42:06.879
<v Hou, Eric>and then it's basically calling this
decision tree regressor function and the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5116-2
00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:11.506
<v Hou, Eric>feed model and predict the model and
output exactly what we've seen.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5120-0
00:42:14.486 --> 00:42:14.886
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5130-0
00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:21.126
<v Hou, Eric>So may 60% is similar as the the KNN.
As you can see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5147-0
00:42:29.366 --> 00:42:33.842
<v Hou, Eric>Is 60%, so it is not so great,
but it's definitely better than the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5147-1
00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:36.046
<v Hou, Eric>linear regression as you can see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5153-0
00:42:36.566 --> 00:42:39.726
<v Hou, Eric>I can start predicting some of the points.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5181-0
00:42:41.316 --> 00:42:44.985
<v Hou, Eric>That for K&amp;
N or linear regression should be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5181-1
00:42:44.985 --> 00:42:49.777
<v Hou, Eric>considered as anomalies.
I do have some really high predictions</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5181-2
00:42:49.777 --> 00:42:50.076
<v Hou, Eric>now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5202-0
00:42:50.676 --> 00:42:56.813
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, from a visualization perspective,
it's better than KN because in K NN</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5202-1
00:42:56.813 --> 00:43:00.746
<v Hou, Eric>everything just tied to.
This is the exact curve.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5236-0
00:43:00.826 --> 00:43:06.480
<v Hou, Eric>But now in in trees I can have somewhat I
use spread it around this plane,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5236-1
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.455
<v Hou, Eric>in my opinion is better,
but for from a quantifiable metrics it's</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5236-2
00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:14.546
<v Hou, Eric>definitely worse, but not too much worse.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5239-0
00:43:15.186 --> 00:43:17.146
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's try a random forest.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5250-0
00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:21.421
<v Hou, Eric>Still,
I'm calling this a random forest function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5250-1
00:43:21.421 --> 00:43:23.626
<v Hou, Eric>I'm doing similar some random.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5261-0
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:28.156
<v Hou, Eric>Parameters and then I just run this from
outer box parameter.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5269-0
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:34.266
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see from May is 5939.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5273-0
00:43:35.836 --> 00:43:36.036
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5298-0
00:43:36.036 --> 00:43:44.117
<v Hou, Eric>It's similar similar level as you know
the KNN Random Forest, 5939, OK,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5298-1
00:43:44.117 --> 00:43:52.310
<v Hou, Eric>not so great but and and in my opinion
still were even worse than simple</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5298-2
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.106
<v Hou, Eric>regression tree.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5328-0
00:43:55.676 --> 00:44:01.392
<v Hou, Eric>And from a map I can I can predict my
user car if it were 10,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5328-1
00:44:01.392 --> 00:44:07.476
<v Hou, Eric>000 I can predict this 116 or sorry 16 or
or or or just four now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5334-0
00:44:07.476 --> 00:44:08.636
<v Hou, Eric>So great predictions.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5338-0
00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:13.466
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do a gradient boost, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5343-0
00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:15.466
<v Hou, Eric>So now gradient boost we have 58.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5346-0
00:44:23.676 --> 00:44:24.956
<v Hou, Eric>So gradient boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5353-0
00:44:30.046 --> 00:44:31.806
<v Hou, Eric>We have 58.8.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5358-0
00:44:35.926 --> 00:44:38.446
<v Hou, Eric>And that's fine. Actually boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5370-0
00:44:39.996 --> 00:44:42.476
<v Hou, Eric>You know that from the chart it
definitely looks like a K NN.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5372-0
00:44:42.476 --> 00:44:43.756
<v Hou, Eric>But you have like 59.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5375-0
00:44:45.396 --> 00:44:45.556
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5383-0
00:44:45.836 --> 00:44:49.196
<v Hou, Eric>So now we have only one input.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5385-0
00:44:50.116 --> 00:44:51.196
<v Hou, Eric>That is the mileage.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5412-0
00:44:56.706 --> 00:45:03.371
<v Hou, Eric>And then we have all those numbers pretty
much all the models other than linear</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5412-1
00:45:03.371 --> 00:45:07.786
<v Hou, Eric>regression.
We have a similar accuracy around 5859%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5437-0
00:45:08.466 --> 00:45:12.903
<v Hou, Eric>No one is significantly better than the
other among those five models,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5437-1
00:45:12.903 --> 00:45:17.901
<v Hou, Eric>but we can conclude only one thing is all
those five models are better than the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5437-2
00:45:17.901 --> 00:45:19.026
<v Hou, Eric>linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5446-0
00:45:20.596 --> 00:45:21.916
<v Hou, Eric>Those sort of things that we can confirm.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5451-0
00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:25.436
<v Hou, Eric>So now let's do one more thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5455-0
00:45:26.146 --> 00:45:28.306
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just start using those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5460-0
00:45:29.876 --> 00:45:32.036
<v Hou, Eric>Encoded encoded features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5466-0
00:45:34.026 --> 00:45:35.946
<v Hou, Eric>So what are those encoded features?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5471-0
00:45:35.946 --> 00:45:39.546
<v Hou, Eric>Those. Oh, I think those clear titles,
sorry.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5482-0
00:45:41.786 --> 00:45:43.106
<v Hou, Eric>The encoded features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5483-0
00:45:43.106 --> 00:45:44.626
<v Hou, Eric>Remember those encoded features?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5492-0
00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:47.906
<v Hou, Eric>Are we do not have so many categories?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5509-0
00:45:48.506 --> 00:45:51.582
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm just assigning a number of
social visit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5509-1
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:54.066
<v Hou, Eric>That's how I actually encoded them, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5522-0
00:45:54.066 --> 00:45:59.226
<v Hou, Eric>So then, now we have 123-4567 features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5528-0
00:45:59.706 --> 00:46:02.506
<v Hou, Eric>I encoded whether or not they have
accident.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5537-0
00:46:02.986 --> 00:46:07.706
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of brand,
whether or not they have a clinic title?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5540-0
00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:09.266
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of different?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5552-0
00:46:11.196 --> 00:46:14.596
<v Hou, Eric>Internal external color and different
fuel type 0.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5554-0
00:46:14.596 --> 00:46:15.396
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5559-0
00:46:16.116 --> 00:46:21.406
<v Hou, Eric>Now we have the usering mileage.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5565-0
00:46:22.956 --> 00:46:26.396
<v Hou, Eric>Number and all encoded features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5578-0
00:46:28.346 --> 00:46:35.348
<v Hou, Eric>And let's see how the models the accuracy
or or error rate of the models change,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5578-1
00:46:35.348 --> 00:46:35.866
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5583-0
00:46:37.436 --> 00:46:38.556
<v Hou, Eric>Together with no numbers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5589-0
00:46:40.196 --> 00:46:41.476
<v Hou, Eric>Is the one that confuse myself.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5593-0
00:46:49.236 --> 00:46:49.716
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5598-0
00:46:50.036 --> 00:46:51.036
<v Hou, Eric>Let's rerun this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5609-0
00:46:51.836 --> 00:46:55.356
<v Hou, Eric>So now instead of only seeing one column,
we see seven columns.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5611-0
00:46:55.356 --> 00:46:56.476
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the seven features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5623-0
00:46:58.036 --> 00:47:01.156
<v Hou, Eric>We just filled in those those mean values.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5627-0
00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:03.116
<v Hou, Eric>Let's retry the linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5644-0
00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:08.408
<v Hou, Eric>So now we we have 7 features or seven
different pieces of information to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5644-1
00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:10.676
<v Hou, Eric>predict the used car price and see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5667-0
00:47:12.226 --> 00:47:21.455
<v Hou, Eric>I'll see even for this video regression
we have the error rate dropped from I</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5667-1
00:47:21.455 --> 00:47:26.306
<v Hou, Eric>forgot 90%. Yeah, 80% to 79. You know it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5671-0
00:47:26.306 --> 00:47:28.266
<v Hou, Eric>Still, 1% gain is good.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5684-0
00:47:29.836 --> 00:47:32.956
<v Hou, Eric>And and we can see that from a linear
regression perspective.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5697-0
00:47:34.876 --> 00:47:40.336
<v Hou, Eric>It it's definitely a linear line and then
two different features that linear</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5697-1
00:47:40.336 --> 00:47:41.116
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5712-0
00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:47.022
<v Hou, Eric>Consider that important are accident
encoded in few time encoded.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5712-1
00:47:47.022 --> 00:47:49.706
<v Hou, Eric>It is really counterintuitive.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5716-0
00:47:51.276 --> 00:47:52.636
<v Hou, Eric>Both yes.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5737-0
00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:58.850
<v Hou, Eric>Is that I do feel those are important
features, but compared to this mileage,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5737-1
00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.036
<v Hou, Eric>I still think mileage is more important.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5756-0
00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:09.126
<v Hou, Eric>So then this linear regression result is
counterintu intuitive in my mind,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5756-1
00:48:09.126 --> 00:48:13.626
<v Hou, Eric>but let's try KNN. OK,
the K in accuracy now is 58.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5758-0
00:48:16.066 --> 00:48:16.826
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5782-0
00:48:20.996 --> 00:48:27.049
<v Hou, Eric>Sort of. Even similar accuracy,
we don't have a lot of improvement from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5782-1
00:48:27.049 --> 00:48:30.076
<v Hou, Eric>the KNN, but something is following.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5791-0
00:48:30.076 --> 00:48:34.716
<v Hou, Eric>My intuition is that the mileage is
definitely good information to have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5792-0
00:48:35.116 --> 00:48:36.956
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try this regression tree.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5810-0
00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:45.476
<v Hou, Eric>So now as you can see we we have the new
regression tree beating KN a bit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5820-0
00:48:47.116 --> 00:48:49.036
<v Hou, Eric>Before we are using only one feature.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5834-0
00:48:49.036 --> 00:48:57.146
<v Hou, Eric>This is simple tree gave us 60% error
versus can 58 but now it's 55.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5841-0
00:48:57.146 --> 00:49:00.026
<v Hou, Eric>Now it's definitely 3% better than KNN.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5846-0
00:49:00.946 --> 00:49:04.946
<v Hou, Eric>Now the big margin,
but definitely getting better.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5850-0
00:49:06.556 --> 00:49:07.556
<v Hou, Eric>Random forest.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5869-0
00:49:10.056 --> 00:49:15.444
<v Hou, Eric>So run the forest. As you can see,
we have more improvement on top of this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5869-1
00:49:15.444 --> 00:49:17.096
<v Hou, Eric>simple regression tree.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5874-0
00:49:17.096 --> 00:49:18.816
<v Hou, Eric>So now we have 52.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5914-0
00:49:19.576 --> 00:49:25.449
<v Hou, Eric>Remember, we have only one feature,
we have 59 versus 58 from of KNN and if</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5914-1
00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:29.622
<v Hou, Eric>60 of Simple Tree now we are adding more
information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5914-2
00:49:29.622 --> 00:49:34.336
<v Hou, Eric>These tree models are definitely
performing better than KNN.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5922-0
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:38.776
<v Hou, Eric>There is a 6% gap between the random
forest and KNN.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5943-0
00:49:41.196 --> 00:49:48.385
<v Hou, Eric>And As for the features from random
forest getting more and more is making</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5943-1
00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:51.356
<v Hou, Eric>more sense to my leg the brand.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5962-0
00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:56.855
<v Hou, Eric>Those are really important features that
you consider when you buy a car,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5962-1
00:49:56.855 --> 00:49:59.676
<v Hou, Eric>how you make the decisions,
or especially use a car.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5964-0
00:49:59.716 --> 00:50:01.116
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see the gradient boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5970-0
00:50:02.876 --> 00:50:03.596
<v Hou, Eric>A gradient boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5978-0
00:50:03.756 --> 00:50:08.710
<v Hou, Eric>We have the accuracy,
we have the error rate lower than 51st</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5978-1
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:09.116
<v Hou, Eric>time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5999-0
00:50:14.356 --> 00:50:21.119
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
now we are moving from 5850 nineish to 48</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/5999-1
00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:26.716
<v Hou, Eric>compared to Kan,
that's a 10% better about 10%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6005-0
00:50:29.606 --> 00:50:30.566
<v Hou, Eric>From grading boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6007-0
00:50:30.566 --> 00:50:32.086
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try extra boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6029-0
00:50:34.026 --> 00:50:41.393
<v Hou, Eric>Now is 55, so you're whenever I do this,
I feel like I'm. I'm. I'm.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6029-1
00:50:41.393 --> 00:50:44.426
<v Hou, Eric>I'm seeing evolution, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6051-0
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:50.928
<v Hou, Eric>So then we went from 80 to 458.
We brand new information,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6051-1
00:50:50.928 --> 00:50:54.706
<v Hou, Eric>just another sixcolumn information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6059-0
00:50:55.306 --> 00:51:00.426
<v Hou, Eric>We reduce its error rate from a 58 to
this 45.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6064-0
00:51:01.956 --> 00:51:03.236
<v Hou, Eric>To this 45 already OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6069-0
00:51:04.836 --> 00:51:08.346
<v Hou, Eric>Now let's use all features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6076-0
00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:12.396
<v Hou, Eric>So all features are the male leg.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6078-0
00:51:16.696 --> 00:51:17.536
<v Hou, Eric>Encoded.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6084-0
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:21.836
<v Hou, Eric>Features and extracted features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6092-0
00:51:25.136 --> 00:51:28.496
<v Hou, Eric>OK so I have this prepaid.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6097-0
00:51:28.496 --> 00:51:29.816
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm just going to use this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6102-0
00:51:31.706 --> 00:51:35.706
<v Hou, Eric>I have all those features that I will be
using them.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6106-0
00:51:37.236 --> 00:51:37.876
<v Hou, Eric>In the following modelling.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6116-0
00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:43.155
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
I'm still gonna record all the error</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6116-1
00:51:43.155 --> 00:51:43.676
<v Hou, Eric>rates.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6120-0
00:51:57.026 --> 00:51:57.186
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6134-0
00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:04.766
<v Hou, Eric>Run this as you can see,
we have 58 columns to use.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6143-0
00:52:06.596 --> 00:52:09.236
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to deal with those noun values.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6148-0
00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:11.956
<v Hou, Eric>Let's start trying linear regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6166-0
00:52:12.836 --> 00:52:16.537
<v Hou, Eric>See,
even linear regression is getting better,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6166-1
00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:20.396
<v Hou, Eric>so we have 62% of errors from linear
regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6179-0
00:52:20.756 --> 00:52:24.516
<v Hou, Eric>We have a good starting point even for
the linear regression it dropped.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6182-0
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:27.636
<v Hou, Eric>The error rate reduced from 80.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6188-0
00:52:29.356 --> 00:52:29.756
<v Hou, Eric>To 62.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6207-0
00:52:30.316 --> 00:52:35.209
<v Hou, Eric>So that means the information we brought,
the additional information we brought to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6207-1
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:39.512
<v Hou, Eric>this model definitely making sense.
And then you're adding value to this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6207-2
00:52:39.512 --> 00:52:39.866
<v Hou, Eric>model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6211-0
00:52:41.596 --> 00:52:42.116
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try knn.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6220-0
00:52:44.356 --> 00:52:46.756
<v Hou, Eric>Is still similar 58.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6236-0
00:52:46.756 --> 00:52:54.036
<v Hou, Eric>So then the information for CNN didn't
provide a lot of additional value.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6245-0
00:52:54.396 --> 00:52:57.196
<v Hou, Eric>So linear regression dropped error rate,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6266-0
00:52:57.196 --> 00:53:00.173
<v Hou, Eric>So linear regression dropped from 80 to
62.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6266-1
00:53:00.173 --> 00:53:05.316
<v Hou, Eric>But even if we bring new information to
KNN, it didn't drop, it's still 58.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6271-0
00:53:07.196 --> 00:53:08.676
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see the simple tree.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6273-0
00:53:11.456 --> 00:53:12.976
<v Hou, Eric>Boom, you can see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6282-0
00:53:14.516 --> 00:53:17.436
<v Hou, Eric>This this red region is getting spread
out.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6286-0
00:53:17.596 --> 00:53:20.196
<v Hou, Eric>It's only 4047 error right now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6330-0
00:53:25.886 --> 00:53:31.854
<v Hou, Eric>So for simple tree it just we just reduce
error rate from 60 to 55 and to 47.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6330-1
00:53:31.854 --> 00:53:38.127
<v Hou, Eric>As you can imagine from the trend we will
have a really good error rate or really</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6330-2
00:53:38.127 --> 00:53:41.646
<v Hou, Eric>bad,
really small error rate for extra boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6334-0
00:53:42.246 --> 00:53:43.566
<v Hou, Eric>So we are getting there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6337-0
00:53:43.726 --> 00:53:45.326
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try and run them forest.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6342-0
00:53:47.906 --> 00:53:49.826
<v Hou, Eric>And now we are below.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6344-0
00:53:50.186 --> 00:53:51.466
<v Hou, Eric>We are below 40.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6359-0
00:53:53.036 --> 00:54:01.056
<v Hou, Eric>For random forest we have only 39,
so it was 52, now 39.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6363-0
00:54:02.626 --> 00:54:05.786
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see the gradient boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6386-0
00:54:07.666 --> 00:54:11.649
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see,
we have all the points spread out.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6386-1
00:54:11.649 --> 00:54:15.706
<v Hou, Eric>We have 38.
So the firm greeting boost we are pushing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6397-0
00:54:17.476 --> 00:54:21.076
<v Hou, Eric>To 38. Now remember we started with 80.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6398-0
00:54:21.076 --> 00:54:22.116
<v Hou, Eric>Now is 38.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6402-0
00:54:24.826 --> 00:54:27.026
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do extra boost.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6417-0
00:54:28.596 --> 00:54:34.164
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
Estr boost we have the error rate below</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6417-1
00:54:34.164 --> 00:54:35.556
<v Hou, Eric>35 S 34.94.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6422-0
00:54:38.246 --> 00:54:41.646
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see. We went from 80.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6441-0
00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:46.208
<v Hou, Eric>And then we add the first group of
information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6441-1
00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:49.596
<v Hou, Eric>We believe in the drive value and it did
or they did.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6448-0
00:54:49.916 --> 00:54:51.836
<v Hou, Eric>So we reduced error rate by half.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6459-0
00:54:52.116 --> 00:54:57.916
<v Hou, Eric>So we move from 80 to 45,
almost five or half.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6480-0
00:54:58.316 --> 00:55:03.242
<v Hou, Eric>Now we bring those extracted features,
those extracted information from the from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6480-1
00:55:03.242 --> 00:55:05.796
<v Hou, Eric>from the original information that we had.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6481-0
00:55:06.276 --> 00:55:07.276
<v Hou, Eric>We reduce.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6516-0
00:55:08.106 --> 00:55:13.713
<v Hou, Eric>We reduce the error rate from 45 to 35.
The question being OK number number one</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6516-1
00:55:13.713 --> 00:55:18.970
<v Hou, Eric>is definitely we can extract more
information and combine some information</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6516-2
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:23.946
<v Hou, Eric>and they're going to make more sense in
predicting the used car price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6539-0
00:55:24.666 --> 00:55:29.831
<v Hou, Eric>There's definitely a huge room for
improvement in there and and can we do</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6539-1
00:55:29.831 --> 00:55:35.066
<v Hou, Eric>another things because we just use some
out of box parameters here, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6548-0
00:55:35.066 --> 00:55:37.746
<v Hou, Eric>So the I just say in random 10 I didn't
change anything.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6562-0
00:55:38.426 --> 00:55:43.426
<v Hou, Eric>There's the one step called tuning that
you can do this grade search.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6565-0
00:55:44.186 --> 00:55:45.866
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm setting up OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6593-0
00:55:45.866 --> 00:55:50.382
<v Hou, Eric>So there's some parameters I can try for
actually boost,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6593-1
00:55:50.382 --> 00:55:56.641
<v Hou, Eric>so I will ask the model to run through
all the combinations of those different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6593-2
00:55:56.641 --> 00:56:00.682
<v Hou, Eric>parameter,
a different set of parameters so that I</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6593-3
00:56:00.682 --> 00:56:02.266
<v Hou, Eric>can select the best.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6608-0
00:56:03.196 --> 00:56:08.296
<v Hou, Eric>Set of parameters definitely based upon
whatever values you provide up to the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6608-1
00:56:08.296 --> 00:56:09.146
<v Hou, Eric>model, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6617-0
00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:12.106
<v Hou, Eric>So now I can use the Basel best model to
predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6635-0
00:56:13.066 --> 00:56:16.206
<v Hou, Eric>So how good my how good my prediction
will be?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6635-1
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:19.946
<v Hou, Eric>I just provide those three values for
North estimators.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6641-0
00:56:20.426 --> 00:56:22.546
<v Hou, Eric>I just provide those values for the DAP.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6652-0
00:56:22.826 --> 00:56:27.341
<v Hou, Eric>I provide those three values for for
learning rate and and for for different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6652-1
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:27.986
<v Hou, Eric>parameters.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6659-0
00:56:27.986 --> 00:56:32.786
<v Hou, Eric>So you gonna run a while,
but nothing worth seeing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6693-0
00:56:33.636 --> 00:56:41.496
<v Hou, Eric>So it will run all 4-5 hundred 45140 fits,
meaning for every combination of those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6693-1
00:56:41.496 --> 00:56:49.357
<v Hou, Eric>values you provided in this prime grade,
you're going to run a model training and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6693-2
00:56:49.357 --> 00:56:50.986
<v Hou, Eric>validation again.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6698-0
00:56:51.226 --> 00:56:53.266
<v Hou, Eric>So it's it's actually using these.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6709-0
00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:59.156
<v Hou, Eric>Five fold cross validation in in this
great search function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6713-0
00:56:59.996 --> 00:57:04.916
<v Hou, Eric>So just give it some time and and you can
see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6727-0
00:57:04.916 --> 00:57:10.168
<v Hou, Eric>So you can see it.
So here is the best hyperparameter file</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6727-1
00:57:10.168 --> 00:57:11.236
<v Hou, Eric>combination.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6753-0
00:57:11.236 --> 00:57:16.265
<v Hou, Eric>So then this based upon all the model
interest run through.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6753-1
00:57:16.265 --> 00:57:23.221
<v Hou, Eric>This is best parameter you should use and
then if you revolution reduce the map to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6753-2
00:57:23.221 --> 00:57:23.556
<v Hou, Eric>32%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6757-0
00:57:39.386 --> 00:57:40.186
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6772-0
00:57:42.156 --> 00:57:48.916
<v Hou, Eric>This this entire process is usually how a
data scientist will solve your problem.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6804-0
00:57:48.916 --> 00:57:55.633
<v Hou, Eric>Solve the business problem right so that
we always go with limited information and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6804-1
00:57:55.633 --> 00:58:02.188
<v Hou, Eric>build a naive model where the naive model
is really could be a linear regression</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6804-2
00:58:02.188 --> 00:58:06.396
<v Hou, Eric>versus the OR two to the price we build
that model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6818-0
00:58:07.356 --> 00:58:11.826
<v Hou, Eric>We'll start really bad results.
80 percent, 80% error.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6818-1
00:58:11.826 --> 00:58:14.426
<v Hou, Eric>That means we have 20% accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6823-0
00:58:16.026 --> 00:58:18.266
<v Hou, Eric>We go from 20% accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6856-0
00:58:19.026 --> 00:58:27.217
<v Hou, Eric>We try different models that help us to
change that 20% accuracy to 40% accuracy</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6856-1
00:58:27.217 --> 00:58:34.497
<v Hou, Eric>and then we we we we convert those
characteristic information into into</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6856-2
00:58:34.497 --> 00:58:35.306
<v Hou, Eric>numbers.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6870-0
00:58:35.466 --> 00:58:40.564
<v Hou, Eric>We encoded them so then we have more
information that we can use and then we</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6870-1
00:58:40.564 --> 00:58:41.226
<v Hou, Eric>move from.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6893-0
00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:47.120
<v Hou, Eric>There's a 40% accuracy to this 55%
accuracy where it just and this is 45%</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6893-1
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.306
<v Hou, Eric>error rate and it's that's 55% accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6896-0
00:58:50.786 --> 00:58:52.506
<v Hou, Eric>So we move from 40 to 55.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6904-0
00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:55.316
<v Hou, Eric>And then we just try our best.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6908-0
00:58:55.316 --> 00:58:56.756
<v Hou, Eric>Not. Not even best, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6915-0
00:58:56.756 --> 00:59:00.146
<v Hou, Eric>We just extract some information from
here, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6921-0
00:59:00.146 --> 00:59:02.626
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's what we did.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6932-0
00:59:02.786 --> 00:59:07.906
<v Hou, Eric>And then we boost accuracy from 55 to
hear about 70.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6953-0
00:59:08.546 --> 00:59:14.777
<v Hou, Eric>So entire process just run so many
different models and track information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6953-1
00:59:14.777 --> 00:59:18.266
<v Hou, Eric>We move from 20% accuracy to 70% accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6964-0
00:59:19.836 --> 00:59:23.196
<v Hou, Eric>And you can do more fine tuning.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6996-0
00:59:23.196 --> 00:59:29.472
<v Hou, Eric>You can do more this information,
more review and and and combining those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6996-1
00:59:29.472 --> 00:59:36.511
<v Hou, Eric>flags and eventually you can you can move
this 70% accuracy to hopefully somewhere</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/6996-2
00:59:36.511 --> 00:59:40.836
<v Hou, Eric>between 70 and 75 that you can definitely
achieve.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7023-0
00:59:42.396 --> 00:59:48.973
<v Hou, Eric>Through these fine tuning and through
this in terms of information combination</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7023-1
00:59:48.973 --> 00:59:53.469
<v Hou, Eric>in terms of grade search,
you can definitely do that,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7023-2
00:59:53.469 --> 00:59:56.716
<v Hou, Eric>but eventually the model you will have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7027-0
00:59:58.396 --> 00:59:59.036
<v Hou, Eric>Is is pretty good.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7031-0
01:00:00.076 --> 01:00:01.076
<v Hou, Eric>This is the model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7040-0
01:00:01.396 --> 01:00:04.116
<v Hou, Eric>This is the model we gonna build to
predict your used car price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7049-0
01:00:04.116 --> 01:00:08.476
<v Hou, Eric>And this is entire test uh data set,
not train.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7066-0
01:00:08.476 --> 01:00:13.025
<v Hou, Eric>So as you can see the the red curve,
the red Dot's gonna spread across the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7066-1
01:00:13.025 --> 01:00:15.876
<v Hou, Eric>entire plane where you see the blue blue
dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7069-0
01:00:16.316 --> 01:00:17.836
<v Hou, Eric>So those are really good results.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7082-0
01:00:20.436 --> 01:00:24.519
<v Hou, Eric>In addition to those those tweaks,
you can you can improve that model</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7082-1
01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:26.036
<v Hou, Eric>accuracy. What you can do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7089-0
01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:28.876
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7099-0
01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:33.666
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the models that we have
learned in this class.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7102-0
01:00:33.986 --> 01:00:35.666
<v Hou, Eric>We covered a little regression.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7105-0
01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.266
<v Hou, Eric>We covered kn.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7126-0
01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:41.308
<v Hou, Eric>We covered the tree models or different
tree models and and and after spring</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7126-1
01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:44.386
<v Hou, Eric>break we will talk about in the newer
network.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7146-0
01:00:44.386 --> 01:00:49.769
<v Hou, Eric>So this is another model we can try and
you will definitely improve the accuracy</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7146-1
01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:52.826
<v Hou, Eric>from these 32.
Well some from these 70 to 75.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7189-0
01:00:53.996 --> 01:01:01.462
<v Hou, Eric>Another thing is I am just extract
information the keywords from those key</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7189-1
01:01:01.462 --> 01:01:08.728
<v Hou, Eric>columns you know in the large language
model you have a different way of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7189-2
01:01:08.728 --> 01:01:13.406
<v Hou, Eric>encoding.
That is you can bring the meaning of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7189-3
01:01:13.406 --> 01:01:17.786
<v Hou, Eric>those words into consideration for
example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7199-0
01:01:19.956 --> 01:01:25.356
<v Hou, Eric>A good example will be the engine is
something that you will not want to model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7226-0
01:01:27.076 --> 01:01:29.875
<v Hou, Eric>So the large ranker model kind of
encoding,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7226-1
01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:34.645
<v Hou, Eric>we'll consider that in a large angle
model kind of encoding we'll consider</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7226-2
01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:36.426
<v Hou, Eric>like this Ant and automated.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7246-0
01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:41.089
<v Hou, Eric>So in in large on your model kind of
encoding you consider those are similar</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7246-1
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:44.056
<v Hou, Eric>vectors,
so you wouldn't have to have those as a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7246-2
01:01:44.056 --> 01:01:45.146
<v Hou, Eric>different columns.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7256-0
01:01:45.146 --> 01:01:49.066
<v Hou, Eric>So they're going to do this meaning
meaningful conference combination for you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7271-0
01:01:50.396 --> 01:01:55.904
<v Hou, Eric>So that's part of large rank model we can
use in a in a in a traditional machine</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7271-1
01:01:55.904 --> 01:01:56.516
<v Hou, Eric>learning.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7316-0
01:01:58.076 --> 01:02:04.701
<v Hou, Eric>But you know those those different new
models and new information or new ways of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7316-1
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:08.545
<v Hou, Eric>combining information,
retracting information,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7316-2
01:02:08.545 --> 01:02:15.334
<v Hou, Eric>we will definitely build on top of these
results and then you gonna move this from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7316-3
01:02:15.334 --> 01:02:19.996
<v Hou, Eric>70 to 75 or 80 at a maximum that's going
to be a really.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7355-0
01:02:19.996 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Hou, Eric>Good model for business to queue the take
away from this analysis is we are we just</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7355-1
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:30.997
<v Hou, Eric>go through this process to review all the
models we have learned and and use those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7355-2
01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:36.531
<v Hou, Eric>models in a regression problem and we can
see that more information you provide the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7355-3
01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:36.926
<v Hou, Eric>model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7364-0
01:02:38.476 --> 01:02:41.596
<v Hou, Eric>The more accuracy result you,
you will enjoy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7392-0
01:02:43.196 --> 01:02:48.349
<v Hou, Eric>And and we definitely have seen that
human beings are pushing the models from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7392-1
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:53.833
<v Hou, Eric>linear regression to actually boost which
is the like published to to public in in</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7392-2
01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:54.956
<v Hou, Eric>the year of 2016.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7401-0
01:02:55.946 --> 01:03:00.026
<v Hou, Eric>So you can see how the history move from
here to here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7412-0
01:03:02.476 --> 01:03:06.316
<v Hou, Eric>And also another take away is you always
need to build.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7432-0
01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:14.916
<v Hou, Eric>A first MVP, the first ever iteration,
zero. You start from a very poor result.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7441-0
01:03:15.236 --> 01:03:18.636
<v Hou, Eric>You prove actually even for that result
you have a positive accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7442-0
01:03:18.636 --> 01:03:19.436
<v Hou, Eric>You know what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7444-0
01:03:19.556 --> 01:03:20.476
<v Hou, Eric>That's not bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7454-0
01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:23.516
<v Hou, Eric>So then you move from there and get more
information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7470-0
01:03:23.516 --> 01:03:27.836
<v Hou, Eric>You find more information from your
business, from your data, and that you,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7470-1
01:03:27.836 --> 01:03:29.826
<v Hou, Eric>you you employ more advanced model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7505-0
01:03:29.826 --> 01:03:35.037
<v Hou, Eric>That's the way how you move from 80%
error to through 30% error. OK,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7505-1
01:03:35.037 --> 01:03:40.701
<v Hou, Eric>I mean I love doing this because this is
always like a reminder of my job.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7505-2
01:03:40.701 --> 01:03:46.289
<v Hou, Eric>Every single day is removing from trash
accuracy to really good accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7505-3
01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.706
<v Hou, Eric>Just going through this kind of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7522-0
01:03:48.706 --> 01:03:52.546
<v Hou, Eric>Process this just give you one taste of
you know your analysis,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7522-1
01:03:52.546 --> 01:03:55.426
<v Hou, Eric>your data scientist was doing every
single day.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7536-0
01:03:55.706 --> 01:04:00.986
<v Hou, Eric>They move from a long journey to improve
the accuracy for you, for your business.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7562-0
01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:04.746
<v Hou, Eric>I hope you guys gonna do in a similar
work,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7562-1
01:04:04.746 --> 01:04:08.929
<v Hou, Eric>but you know when you're doing this kind
of modeling work,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7562-2
01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:13.325
<v Hou, Eric>start low start working some people to
grab more information,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7562-3
01:04:13.325 --> 01:04:16.586
<v Hou, Eric>start trying to use some more advanced
model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7568-0
01:04:16.746 --> 01:04:20.706
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the three success recipe for
you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7571-0
01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:22.596
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7573-0
01:04:22.636 --> 01:04:23.356
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7590-0
01:04:35.256 --> 01:04:41.007
<v Hou, Eric>No questions. OK,
I'll upload this this juvenile notebook</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7590-1
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:42.296
<v Hou, Eric>to D2L today.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7601-0
01:04:42.296 --> 01:04:47.776
<v Hou, Eric>So then you guys can, you know,
having some fun writing those models?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7607-0
01:04:47.776 --> 01:04:49.736
<v Hou, Eric>I mean then when I coded this,
I'm definitely happy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7623-0
01:04:49.736 --> 01:04:53.356
<v Hou, Eric>Fun a lot of fun. You know,
this is sort of like seeing seeing a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7623-1
01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:56.976
<v Hou, Eric>history book, reading a history book of,
you know, human beings.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7631-0
01:04:58.516 --> 01:05:00.276
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's. It's a lot of fun.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7638-0
01:05:00.276 --> 01:05:02.756
<v Hou, Eric>You see how the model move from here to
there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7642-0
01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:04.076
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's a lot of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7644-0
01:05:04.636 --> 01:05:05.156
<v Hou, Eric>It's a fun time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7651-0
01:05:07.306 --> 01:05:09.426
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, all right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7658-0
01:05:09.986 --> 01:05:13.506
<v Hou, Eric>So if no questions,
let's take a 15 minute break.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7659-0
01:05:13.506 --> 01:05:14.226
<v Hou, Eric>We come back.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7670-0
01:05:15.876 --> 01:05:19.116
<v Hou, Eric>6:55 we have two more models to cover.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7681-0
01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:25.316
<v Hou, Eric>One is time series, another one is SVM.
Those are not quite difficult models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7692-0
01:05:27.036 --> 01:05:29.476
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely less difficult than the tree
models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7700-0
01:05:29.476 --> 01:05:33.441
<v Hou, Eric>Quite straightforward,
a lot of models you may have used every</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7700-1
01:05:33.441 --> 01:05:34.636
<v Hou, Eric>single day already.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7720-0
01:05:35.296 --> 01:05:39.176
<v Hou, Eric>So definitely easy models to cover.
And then we cover those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7720-1
01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:42.421
<v Hou, Eric>We take a break and we celebrate the
spring break,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7720-2
01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:44.456
<v Hou, Eric>we come back with a new network.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7723-0
01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.336
<v Hou, Eric>All right. I will see you guys.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7728-0
01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:49.156
<v Hou, Eric>At 6:55.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7880-0
01:21:53.556 --> 01:21:55.996
<v Hou, Eric>Alright, welcome back.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7882-0
01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.146
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7887-0
01:21:59.186 --> 01:22:00.666
<v Hou, Eric>Not this one here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7890-0
01:22:01.826 --> 01:22:02.746
<v Hou, Eric>Hi, I'm serious, mother.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7896-0
01:22:09.936 --> 01:22:12.736
<v Hou, Eric>Sign in for yes. Here we go.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7900-0
01:22:31.466 --> 01:22:31.946
<v Hou, Eric>Right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7905-0
01:22:34.396 --> 01:22:35.836
<v Hou, Eric>OK, you guys see this slide.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7909-0
01:22:38.916 --> 01:22:39.076
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yep.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7914-0
01:22:40.406 --> 01:22:42.606
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7921-0
01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:46.486
<v Hou, Eric>I'm pretty sure that you guys are using
time series model all the time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7941-0
01:22:46.486 --> 01:22:54.254
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is at least you know how to
visualize because all the stock price</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7941-1
01:22:54.254 --> 01:22:57.986
<v Hou, Eric>data is there all time series, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7947-0
01:22:57.986 --> 01:23:01.546
<v Hou, Eric>So then you track your your company's
stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7956-0
01:23:01.546 --> 01:23:03.906
<v Hou, Eric>You track different companies stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7960-0
01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.266
<v Hou, Eric>You track SP500.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7963-0
01:23:06.666 --> 01:23:07.866
<v Hou, Eric>Those are time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7970-0
01:23:08.706 --> 01:23:10.346
<v Hou, Eric>You track the interest rate you have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7978-0
01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:13.809
<v Hou, Eric>You track the exchange rate.
You have all different economic</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7978-1
01:23:13.809 --> 01:23:14.426
<v Hou, Eric>indicators.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7989-0
01:23:15.236 --> 01:23:19.616
<v Hou, Eric>There's all different time series,
so it is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/7992-0
01:23:19.736 --> 01:23:23.536
<v Hou, Eric>It is #1 super widely used.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8001-0
01:23:25.076 --> 01:23:28.196
<v Hou, Eric>Away to to to present data, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8011-0
01:23:28.196 --> 01:23:32.466
<v Hou, Eric>So then the reason why people love Time
series is, you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8011-1
01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:34.916
<v Hou, Eric>people can derive a lot of insight.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8015-0
01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:38.116
<v Hou, Eric>By comparing the current.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8024-0
01:23:39.836 --> 01:23:40.996
<v Hou, Eric>Yu versus the historical Yu.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8028-0
01:23:40.996 --> 01:23:43.076
<v Hou, Eric>They can definitely.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8035-0
01:23:43.196 --> 01:23:45.796
<v Hou, Eric>They want to see the trend, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8041-0
01:23:45.796 --> 01:23:48.956
<v Hou, Eric>So then whether or not this uprising
trend or is it downward?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8048-0
01:23:49.386 --> 01:23:51.826
<v Hou, Eric>From the data, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8058-0
01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:55.546
<v Hou, Eric>So then the trend is super important in
in stock price analysis, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8066-0
01:23:55.546 --> 01:23:59.146
<v Hou, Eric>So then and also people want to see is
there any seasonality?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8090-0
01:24:00.716 --> 01:24:05.019
<v Hou, Eric>If you do see some seasonality from from
the stock price data and then you can</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8090-1
01:24:05.019 --> 01:24:07.796
<v Hou, Eric>definitely leverage that information to
make some.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8133-0
01:24:10.116 --> 01:24:13.259
<v Hou, Eric>Good value, good good result,
good net com.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8133-1
01:24:13.259 --> 01:24:18.473
<v Hou, Eric>But I do not think there is any
seasonality in any stock data because if</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8133-2
01:24:18.473 --> 01:24:22.401
<v Hou, Eric>they were war,
you know people gonna take advantage of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8133-3
01:24:22.401 --> 01:24:27.186
<v Hou, Eric>that and that that seasonality gonna be
used as a arbitrage right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8139-0
01:24:27.186 --> 01:24:30.826
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so I don't think there's any seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8153-0
01:24:32.556 --> 01:24:37.436
<v Hou, Eric>And then Significantity is sort of like
irregular cycles, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8154-0
01:24:37.436 --> 01:24:38.036
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8173-0
01:24:40.476 --> 01:24:47.415
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know if any data has that or
sometimes that you know if you believe if</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8173-1
01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:50.226
<v Hou, Eric>you check meta U.S. stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8209-0
01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:58.274
<v Hou, Eric>It declined to a really low value and
then after that it just sort of a pop up</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8209-1
01:24:58.274 --> 01:25:03.112
<v Hou, Eric>just going high.
I don't think that has nothing to do with</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8209-2
01:25:03.112 --> 01:25:09.016
<v Hou, Eric>you know, business cycles or so,
but some people may believe in that is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8209-3
01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:11.476
<v Hou, Eric>really up to what what really.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8223-0
01:25:11.676 --> 01:25:16.071
<v Hou, Eric>Kind of theory you believe in and and
definitely there are some noise,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8223-1
01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:16.876
<v Hou, Eric>you know you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8241-0
01:25:19.556 --> 01:25:25.192
<v Hou, Eric>Some people believe you know you can or
you can extract those information from,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8241-1
01:25:25.192 --> 01:25:27.306
<v Hou, Eric>for example, stock price data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8270-0
01:25:29.156 --> 01:25:34.403
<v Hou, Eric>And then some people want to use time
series model to predict stock price and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8270-1
01:25:34.403 --> 01:25:39.516
<v Hou, Eric>those are they are using those kind of
models to optimize their portfolios.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8284-0
01:25:41.996 --> 01:25:45.563
<v Hou, Eric>And for example,
like there is a three factor model that's</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8284-1
01:25:45.563 --> 01:25:47.316
<v Hou, Eric>tactically time series model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8302-0
01:25:48.996 --> 01:25:54.225
<v Hou, Eric>What I really talking about time series
model is they want to decompose the time</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8302-1
01:25:54.225 --> 01:25:57.066
<v Hou, Eric>series signal into transitionally any
wise.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8305-0
01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:00.196
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8309-0
01:26:00.196 --> 01:26:01.436
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think that will work.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8327-0
01:26:02.656 --> 01:26:05.558
<v Hou, Eric>But you know,
people are doing it all the time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8327-1
01:26:05.558 --> 01:26:08.944
<v Hou, Eric>And and there,
there's definitely some traditional time</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8327-2
01:26:08.944 --> 01:26:10.576
<v Hou, Eric>series models, for example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8335-0
01:26:12.076 --> 01:26:13.876
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to tell you I'm going to show
you guys.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8337-0
01:26:16.396 --> 01:26:16.956
<v Hou, Eric>But.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8349-0
01:26:18.596 --> 01:26:25.236
<v Hou, Eric>My understanding is you can definitely
apply those time series model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8360-0
01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:31.316
<v Hou, Eric>The the stock price data, or SP500?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8366-0
01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:35.626
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think the accuracy really is is
really good.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8382-0
01:26:37.036 --> 01:26:40.519
<v Hou, Eric>When I was doing my PhD,
I'm doing the stochastic differential</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8382-1
01:26:40.519 --> 01:26:41.956
<v Hou, Eric>equations, right? So then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8401-0
01:26:43.556 --> 01:26:46.886
<v Hou, Eric>We believe a lot of people believe in,
you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8401-1
01:26:46.886 --> 01:26:51.236
<v Hou, Eric>the stock price and random walk or some
people believe in that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8414-0
01:26:51.236 --> 01:26:54.796
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's a wine is add to some some
signal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8420-0
01:26:55.516 --> 01:27:00.076
<v Hou, Eric>So some stochastic differential equation
can explain the stock prices.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8442-0
01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:05.482
<v Hou, Eric>That's what people believe.
I I don't think anyone can predict that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8442-1
01:27:05.482 --> 01:27:09.026
<v Hou, Eric>and any model like time series model is
really hard to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8468-0
01:27:09.026 --> 01:27:14.191
<v Hou, Eric>That's so in order to have,
like really good time suit stop price</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8468-1
01:27:14.191 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Hou, Eric>prediction.
So you you may want to use a lot of lot</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8468-2
01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.546
<v Hou, Eric>of information just one time series model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8472-0
01:27:21.546 --> 01:27:22.706
<v Hou, Eric>I I doubt it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8480-0
01:27:22.986 --> 01:27:25.026
<v Hou, Eric>But you can still use time series model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8490-0
01:27:25.546 --> 01:27:28.884
<v Hou, Eric>Apply those model.
For example your inventory,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8490-1
01:27:28.884 --> 01:27:31.866
<v Hou, Eric>inventory model optimization applications.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8494-0
01:27:33.196 --> 01:27:35.076
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then usually.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8506-0
01:27:37.106 --> 01:27:40.986
<v Hou, Eric>For for a lot of companies,
especially for grocery companies.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8510-0
01:27:42.556 --> 01:27:44.396
<v Hou, Eric>Their sales are pretty.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8520-0
01:27:46.436 --> 01:27:50.640
<v Hou, Eric>Much easier to predict. For example,
like you, you want this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8520-1
01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.996
<v Hou, Eric>you want to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8534-0
01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:59.836
<v Hou, Eric>Products, for example banana.
You want to predict the banana sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8549-0
01:28:00.076 --> 01:28:03.975
<v Hou, Eric>You want to predict that Turkey sales and
those kind of things.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8549-1
01:28:03.975 --> 01:28:07.386
<v Hou, Eric>Now they have a high seasonality around
uh in the data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8555-0
01:28:07.386 --> 01:28:10.826
<v Hou, Eric>So then the time series model are really
really good.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8560-0
01:28:10.826 --> 01:28:15.226
<v Hou, Eric>Uh on those data, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8564-0
01:28:15.226 --> 01:28:17.666
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so then you can actually.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8571-0
01:28:19.236 --> 01:28:21.716
<v Hou, Eric>View the time series model to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8580-0
01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:27.636
<v Hou, Eric>A local store, for example,
target stores sales, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8593-0
01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:31.836
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can predict next next week
you can predict the next month.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8612-0
01:28:32.236 --> 01:28:35.839
<v Hou, Eric>So you can actually help the company to
manage their inventory levels and then</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8612-1
01:28:35.839 --> 01:28:39.076
<v Hou, Eric>they don't have to keep so much inventory.
For example, it's too much.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8632-0
01:28:39.276 --> 01:28:42.203
<v Hou, Eric>So many so many bananas in in in the
inventory,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8632-1
01:28:42.203 --> 01:28:44.946
<v Hou, Eric>but then some banana will eventually go
bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8634-0
01:28:45.146 --> 01:28:46.506
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the business loss.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8661-0
01:28:48.076 --> 01:28:53.405
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think time series model can be
applied to on the stock price data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8661-1
01:28:53.405 --> 01:28:58.735
<v Hou, Eric>but time series model can really can be
really good model on the inventory</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8661-2
01:28:58.735 --> 01:28:59.516
<v Hou, Eric>management.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8681-0
01:29:01.316 --> 01:29:05.097
<v Hou, Eric>Or inventory optimization time series
model is really good,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8681-1
01:29:05.097 --> 01:29:10.201
<v Hou, Eric>but just for this class I'm using the the
finance data as an example to show you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8681-2
01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:10.516
<v Hou, Eric>guys.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8685-0
01:29:12.976 --> 01:29:14.936
<v Hou, Eric>How to apply this time series model?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8715-0
01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:21.921
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
I plot this chart so SP500 close price is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8715-1
01:29:21.921 --> 01:29:29.524
<v Hou, Eric>definitely a time series and if you go
from you know a year or two 1928 and then</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8715-2
01:29:29.524 --> 01:29:32.716
<v Hou, Eric>you can actually go from there to.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8727-0
01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:39.836
<v Hou, Eric>2025 So this how this time series SPR 500
went?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8730-0
01:29:39.836 --> 01:29:41.196
<v Hou, Eric>So it was pretty impressive.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8740-0
01:29:42.476 --> 01:29:46.496
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then you can actually try to decompose</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8740-1
01:29:46.496 --> 01:29:47.316
<v Hou, Eric>the trend?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8767-0
01:29:49.116 --> 01:29:53.198
<v Hou, Eric>The cyclicality and then noise from this
time series data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8767-1
01:29:53.198 --> 01:29:58.732
<v Hou, Eric>usually people just care about you know
the trend and seasonality and then this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8767-2
01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:00.116
<v Hou, Eric>one not necessarily.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8775-0
01:30:01.836 --> 01:30:04.596
<v Hou, Eric>Usually people can can can use different.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8786-0
01:30:06.316 --> 01:30:11.036
<v Hou, Eric>In different input variable independent
variables explain this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8836-0
01:30:12.546 --> 01:30:18.863
<v Hou, Eric>For trend and there are some established
method that you can apply onto the the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8836-1
01:30:18.863 --> 01:30:22.732
<v Hou, Eric>the signal.
You can see that the trend is really</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8836-2
01:30:22.732 --> 01:30:26.838
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not the data is moving to One
Direction,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8836-3
01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.629
<v Hou, Eric>say uprising trend or low or downwarding
trend.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8836-4
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:33.866
<v Hou, Eric>So then people can make decision whether.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8838-0
01:30:33.866 --> 01:30:34.266
<v Hou, Eric>Or not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8846-0
01:30:35.836 --> 01:30:39.276
<v Hou, Eric>They they should enter the game,
start buying some stocks.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8849-0
01:30:40.956 --> 01:30:41.276
<v Hou, Eric>The seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8854-0
01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:44.586
<v Hou, Eric>Some people believe in you can go up and
down.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8858-0
01:30:46.196 --> 01:30:47.996
<v Hou, Eric>Star Prize is like what I said.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8861-0
01:30:47.996 --> 01:30:50.156
<v Hou, Eric>I don't believe in seasonality, but.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8895-0
01:30:51.706 --> 01:30:55.078
<v Hou, Eric>True seasonality could be you know for
for for sales of banana.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8895-1
01:30:55.078 --> 01:30:59.503
<v Hou, Eric>You know usually you have a pretty high a
pretty spikes of sales during the weekend</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8895-2
01:30:59.503 --> 01:31:02.506
<v Hou, Eric>just because you know people are doing
grocery shopping.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8914-0
01:31:04.186 --> 01:31:08.036
<v Hou, Eric>And also for Turkey, you know,
people just buy Turkey during, you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8914-1
01:31:08.036 --> 01:31:09.426
<v Hou, Eric>weeks before Thanksgiving.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8919-0
01:31:09.706 --> 01:31:13.666
<v Hou, Eric>So strong seasonality can be found in
those data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8933-0
01:31:15.486 --> 01:31:17.694
<v Hou, Eric>And definitely whatever model you're
using,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8933-1
01:31:17.694 --> 01:31:21.206
<v Hou, Eric>you still gonna have the noise and then
the noise is not a bad thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8947-0
01:31:22.746 --> 01:31:25.905
<v Hou, Eric>By analyzing the noise,
you can see if you're missing some key</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8947-1
01:31:25.905 --> 01:31:26.506
<v Hou, Eric>information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8984-0
01:31:28.186 --> 01:31:31.711
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
a lot of the model we are doing is is is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8984-1
01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:36.617
<v Hou, Eric>actually minimize the noise,
but we cannot. If you do see a model now,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8984-2
01:31:36.617 --> 01:31:42.146
<v Hou, Eric>you don't have any noise that means you
you either use some future information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8990-0
01:31:42.186 --> 01:31:45.066
<v Hou, Eric>I shouldn't shouldn't be using or #2 is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/8996-0
01:31:46.786 --> 01:31:49.056
<v Hou, Eric>Just simply something wrong in the model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9003-0
01:31:50.906 --> 01:31:53.106
<v Hou, Eric>Noise. You cannot eliminate noise.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9009-0
01:31:55.026 --> 01:31:56.866
<v Hou, Eric>And then what? We can learn more.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9023-0
01:31:58.626 --> 01:32:01.866
<v Hou, Eric>How different models were developed is
actually by analyzing noise.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9030-0
01:32:01.866 --> 01:32:03.026
<v Hou, Eric>Noise is a good thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9049-0
01:32:03.026 --> 01:32:08.119
<v Hou, Eric>By analyzing the noise,
you can find a lot of insight and then to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9049-1
01:32:08.119 --> 01:32:12.749
<v Hou, Eric>improve your model,
let me just show you the no SP500 data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9049-2
01:32:12.749 --> 01:32:13.906
<v Hou, Eric>right? So then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9061-0
01:32:16.466 --> 01:32:21.776
<v Hou, Eric>This is the original time series from for
SP500 from 1990 to now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9067-0
01:32:23.306 --> 01:32:24.586
<v Hou, Eric>Like to the moment I run this model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9102-0
01:32:26.426 --> 01:32:30.454
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah,
so next you can see it's up rising trend,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9102-1
01:32:30.454 --> 01:32:36.852
<v Hou, Eric>definitely some turbulence around 2000
and around 2008 and then and then because</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9102-2
01:32:36.852 --> 01:32:38.906
<v Hou, Eric>of COVID definitely right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9107-0
01:32:38.906 --> 01:32:42.026
<v Hou, Eric>So then our trend is like this
seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9117-0
01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:48.506
<v Hou, Eric>The reason I I I'm highlighting this
piece is since.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9153-0
01:32:50.146 --> 01:32:55.217
<v Hou, Eric>I will say 2016,
but definitely highlighted during the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9153-1
01:32:55.217 --> 01:33:02.684
<v Hou, Eric>COVID is that the the SP500 is getting
less and less predictable as you can see,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9153-2
01:33:02.684 --> 01:33:04.436
<v Hou, Eric>this is a residual.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9159-0
01:33:04.436 --> 01:33:08.396
<v Hou, Eric>Basically, noise is getting really,
really big.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9198-0
01:33:08.396 --> 01:33:12.141
<v Hou, Eric>It's really,
really significant and I cannot ignore</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9198-1
01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:17.399
<v Hou, Eric>and also the seasonality is really
getting more and more high frequency.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9198-2
01:33:17.399 --> 01:33:20.784
<v Hou, Eric>What I say.
And then before this COVID period,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9198-3
01:33:20.784 --> 01:33:26.690
<v Hou, Eric>it's sort of some seasonality and sort of
some strong noise as you can see around</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9198-4
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:27.626
<v Hou, Eric>2008 a Finan.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9200-0
01:33:27.626 --> 01:33:27.796
<v Hou, Eric>Crisis.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9217-0
01:33:28.586 --> 01:33:32.485
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why it's that you know the
noise is really good indicator to show</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9217-1
01:33:32.485 --> 01:33:34.896
<v Hou, Eric>you some key information we definitely
missed.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9241-0
01:33:36.466 --> 01:33:41.986
<v Hou, Eric>And then what we can see is we missed a a
timing information around 2008 and then</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9241-1
01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:46.226
<v Hou, Eric>we need to tell the model that is because
of financial crisis.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9256-0
01:33:47.906 --> 01:33:52.866
<v Hou, Eric>And here is the information that we
definitely missed is a lot right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9259-0
01:33:52.866 --> 01:33:54.026
<v Hou, Eric>So we have COVID.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9267-0
01:33:54.586 --> 01:33:59.266
<v Hou, Eric>We do have a QE and then we do have a
supply chain issue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9311-0
01:34:01.066 --> 01:34:06.185
<v Hou, Eric>And also since like 2025,
we going forward where we may have a lot</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9311-1
01:34:06.185 --> 01:34:12.144
<v Hou, Eric>of tariff issue to come in here from a
general trend perspective by analyzing</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9311-2
01:34:12.144 --> 01:34:17.645
<v Hou, Eric>for SP500 what we can see is uh the
variation is getting much bigger is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9311-3
01:34:17.645 --> 01:34:19.096
<v Hou, Eric>getting bigger and.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9319-0
01:34:19.096 --> 01:34:21.576
<v Hou, Eric>Bigger and then a lot of umm.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9328-0
01:34:22.136 --> 01:34:24.656
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
nuisance cannot be explained like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9332-0
01:34:24.976 --> 01:34:27.056
<v Hou, Eric>It's just like highest level in history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9340-0
01:34:29.746 --> 01:34:31.546
<v Hou, Eric>You know, it's just making the point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9366-0
01:34:32.546 --> 01:34:37.212
<v Hou, Eric>You know it's getting more and more or
less and less unpredictable and going</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9366-1
01:34:37.212 --> 01:34:40.788
<v Hou, Eric>future like 2025,
we're gonna have a lot of terrorists are</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9366-2
01:34:40.788 --> 01:34:44.666
<v Hou, Eric>gonna have a lot of different decisions
made by the government.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9369-0
01:34:44.666 --> 01:34:46.266
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9387-0
01:34:48.846 --> 01:34:52.599
<v Hou, Eric>I will predict that this kind of
turbulence is kind of up or down</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9387-1
01:34:52.599 --> 01:34:55.726
<v Hou, Eric>whereation gonna be getting bigger and
bigger so then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9394-0
01:34:58.346 --> 01:34:59.426
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe people are right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9399-0
01:34:59.426 --> 01:35:02.946
<v Hou, Eric>So then you keeping cache,
not investing in the stock market?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9407-0
01:35:04.986 --> 01:35:06.106
<v Hou, Eric>But this is the thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9411-0
01:35:06.106 --> 01:35:07.426
<v Hou, Eric>That is what the data is suggesting.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9414-0
01:35:10.286 --> 01:35:11.446
<v Hou, Eric>The stationary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9423-0
01:35:13.106 --> 01:35:15.226
<v Hou, Eric>This we we assume that sometimes there
should be.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9431-0
01:35:17.066 --> 01:35:19.026
<v Hou, Eric>Stationary is this stationary?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9433-0
01:35:19.026 --> 01:35:21.786
<v Hou, Eric>Is saying that some patterns.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9446-0
01:35:23.626 --> 01:35:28.786
<v Hou, Eric>Mean variation or auto correlations is is
is repeating over time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9450-0
01:35:28.786 --> 01:35:29.706
<v Hou, Eric>So what does it mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9458-0
01:35:29.706 --> 01:35:33.883
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning,
like I will say the data will come back</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9458-1
01:35:33.883 --> 01:35:34.906
<v Hou, Eric>to the mean.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9476-0
01:35:36.746 --> 01:35:42.465
<v Hou, Eric>And then the current data should have
some correlation with the data that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9476-1
01:35:42.465 --> 01:35:43.856
<v Hou, Eric>happen in history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9477-0
01:35:44.216 --> 01:35:45.136
<v Hou, Eric>So then what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9488-0
01:35:45.136 --> 01:35:50.416
<v Hou, Eric>What does that mean? So then if if,
if if my yesterday stop price right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9491-0
01:35:51.986 --> 01:35:52.466
<v Hou, Eric>Went high.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9502-0
01:35:52.826 --> 01:35:57.666
<v Hou, Eric>So then should should it affect my
current day stock price?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9509-0
01:35:58.066 --> 01:36:00.386
<v Hou, Eric>Should it go high higher level as well?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9524-0
01:36:00.386 --> 01:36:04.723
<v Hou, Eric>So then people believe that, you know,
if the stationary time series,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9524-1
01:36:04.723 --> 01:36:06.706
<v Hou, Eric>you would have those properties.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9547-0
01:36:07.546 --> 01:36:16.122
<v Hou, Eric>I checked the SP500 as expected is non
stationary. So basically telling U.S.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9547-1
01:36:16.122 --> 01:36:22.136
<v Hou, Eric>history won't repeat at least won't
repeat for SP500.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9571-0
01:36:24.466 --> 01:36:29.888
<v Hou, Eric>But you know this is only using the time
series only using the finance finance</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9571-1
01:36:29.888 --> 01:36:31.466
<v Hou, Eric>data as example, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9575-0
01:36:31.906 --> 01:36:35.146
<v Hou, Eric>So you're predicting grocery inventory
you're predicting?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9602-0
01:36:37.506 --> 01:36:43.899
<v Hou, Eric>Different works and then you know like
could be stationary and then just this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9602-1
01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:50.046
<v Hou, Eric>one is we are not going to details of
what stationary time series will be.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9610-0
01:36:50.366 --> 01:36:52.966
<v Hou, Eric>And then what's the mathematical
definition of those?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9627-0
01:36:53.326 --> 01:36:59.773
<v Hou, Eric>Just keep in mind a lot of a lot of time
series models assume that time series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9627-1
01:36:59.773 --> 01:37:01.486
<v Hou, Eric>should be stationary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9642-0
01:37:03.226 --> 01:37:08.346
<v Hou, Eric>Arguably that's a strong assumption.
A lot of times, series or not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9657-0
01:37:08.746 --> 01:37:15.915
<v Hou, Eric>So then there are some ways that you can
convert a non stationary times series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9657-1
01:37:15.915 --> 01:37:18.456
<v Hou, Eric>into stationary time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9670-0
01:37:18.816 --> 01:37:22.976
<v Hou, Eric>One way to do that is to do differencing.
What is differencing?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9681-0
01:37:23.256 --> 01:37:27.536
<v Hou, Eric>The differencing is one way to average
out the different up and downs.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9694-0
01:37:27.936 --> 01:37:31.732
<v Hou, Eric>So you can do today minus yesterday so
that you can have that kind of a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9694-1
01:37:31.732 --> 01:37:32.576
<v Hou, Eric>different thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9702-0
01:37:32.576 --> 01:37:36.214
<v Hou, Eric>We can have a moving average.
Those kind of my third.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9702-1
01:37:36.214 --> 01:37:37.696
<v Hou, Eric>You can actually make.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9717-0
01:37:38.506 --> 01:37:41.288
<v Hou, Eric>Time is more and more stationary,
but you you will.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9717-1
01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:43.856
<v Hou, Eric>By doing so you will lose a lot of
information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9731-0
01:37:45.376 --> 01:37:48.663
<v Hou, Eric>You can do defunding as well,
but after you defunding you may have like</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9731-1
01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:49.896
<v Hou, Eric>just basically up and down.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9732-0
01:37:50.136 --> 01:37:50.896
<v Hou, Eric>Random walk.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9738-0
01:37:51.896 --> 01:37:55.576
<v Hou, Eric>I don't like the idea of a different
thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9752-0
01:37:55.576 --> 01:38:02.816
<v Hou, Eric>I don't like the the idea of moving
averaging those those time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9766-0
01:38:03.576 --> 01:38:08.268
<v Hou, Eric>I will say if you do see after running
whatever model you do,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9766-1
01:38:08.268 --> 01:38:11.976
<v Hou, Eric>see your your your errors right,
your residuals.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9787-0
01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:18.338
<v Hou, Eric>There is a huge residuals.
You really need to go go back to the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9787-1
01:38:18.338 --> 01:38:22.848
<v Hou, Eric>business,
go back to whoever providing the data and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9787-2
01:38:22.848 --> 01:38:24.496
<v Hou, Eric>ask the person why.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9795-0
01:38:24.656 --> 01:38:29.896
<v Hou, Eric>Here's a spike that is so strange,
and why we've seen.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9820-0
01:38:31.466 --> 01:38:36.860
<v Hou, Eric>This kind of dip every,
let's say three months or every two weeks,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9820-1
01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:43.221
<v Hou, Eric>there must be some reason behind seen
that you do see those times there is not</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9820-2
01:38:43.221 --> 01:38:44.106
<v Hou, Eric>stationary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9832-0
01:38:44.386 --> 01:38:48.456
<v Hou, Eric>You do see there are some spikes deeps
that cannot be explained.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9843-0
01:38:48.896 --> 01:38:52.816
<v Hou, Eric>That is because you do not have those
information to explain this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9849-0
01:38:53.456 --> 01:38:56.376
<v Hou, Eric>It has nothing wrong it it already
happens.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9857-0
01:38:56.376 --> 01:38:59.536
<v Hou, Eric>Something must cause those kind of
phenomena.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9874-0
01:38:59.536 --> 01:39:05.568
<v Hou, Eric>So then you need to find a reason not to
modify the timing series and modify your</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9874-1
01:39:05.568 --> 01:39:05.936
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9880-0
01:39:05.936 --> 01:39:06.976
<v Hou, Eric>Just fill in the model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9882-0
01:39:06.976 --> 01:39:08.656
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think it's the right thing to do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9901-0
01:39:11.066 --> 01:39:15.448
<v Hou, Eric>With that being said,
I never asked my whoever reported me or I</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9901-1
01:39:15.448 --> 01:39:17.296
<v Hou, Eric>don't recommend doing this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9934-0
01:39:17.296 --> 01:39:22.370
<v Hou, Eric>The different saying,
like those kind of work umm for my client?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9934-1
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:28.223
<v Hou, Eric>Umm. Say target. Say whoever. Umm.
But with that being said a lot of other</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9934-2
01:39:28.223 --> 01:39:34.312
<v Hou, Eric>information could be meaningful to use
like D training or or different thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9934-3
01:39:34.312 --> 01:39:38.136
<v Hou, Eric>For example your heartbeat right?
So I I was in.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9938-0
01:39:38.136 --> 01:39:40.576
<v Hou, Eric>A project right to develop.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9969-0
01:39:41.866 --> 01:39:46.326
<v Hou, Eric>A smart camera.
So it's really taking your your face</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9969-1
01:39:46.326 --> 01:39:52.722
<v Hou, Eric>taking 30/20/20 second of your your your
your face video and then you gonna</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9969-2
01:39:52.722 --> 01:39:56.256
<v Hou, Eric>analyze each picture of that video, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9989-0
01:39:56.256 --> 01:40:02.044
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then definitely there are
some lights you know on your face and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/9989-1
01:40:02.044 --> 01:40:05.776
<v Hou, Eric>then making them shadows here and shadows
there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10002-0
01:40:06.016 --> 01:40:09.472
<v Hou, Eric>And then you see the strength of the the,
the,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10002-1
01:40:09.472 --> 01:40:13.296
<v Hou, Eric>the color reflected by your face is up
and down so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10012-0
01:40:14.106 --> 01:40:15.946
<v Hou, Eric>There may be some trend over there.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10017-0
01:40:15.946 --> 01:40:17.626
<v Hou, Eric>So then you do want to do this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10019-0
01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:18.146
<v Hou, Eric>Do trending.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10060-0
01:40:18.696 --> 01:40:22.883
<v Hou, Eric>You do want to do this differencing to
get rid of those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10060-1
01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:28.907
<v Hou, Eric>Umm outside light signal out of your your
your skin signal and then by using your</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10060-2
01:40:28.907 --> 01:40:34.784
<v Hou, Eric>skin signal you you analyze this code and
call seasonality of that time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10060-3
01:40:34.784 --> 01:40:38.016
<v Hou, Eric>That can tell you your your heartbeat
rate.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10067-0
01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:40.656
<v Hou, Eric>But that has nothing to do with finance.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10073-0
01:40:41.016 --> 01:40:43.816
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you're doing the business data,
you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10080-0
01:40:44.626 --> 01:40:47.106
<v Hou, Eric>Before you do this differencing,
detrending.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10108-0
01:40:49.696 --> 01:40:56.692
<v Hou, Eric>Method ask yourself whether or not you're
losing significant information because by</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10108-1
01:40:56.692 --> 01:41:02.188
<v Hou, Eric>doing so you are going to lose
significant information. For that,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10108-2
01:41:02.188 --> 01:41:04.936
<v Hou, Eric>you know heartbeat rate analysis.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10125-0
01:41:05.376 --> 01:41:08.848
<v Hou, Eric>I'm losing the delight,
which I I'm I want to.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10125-1
01:41:08.848 --> 01:41:13.576
<v Hou, Eric>I want to get rid of the light signal
from from my time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10132-0
01:41:14.386 --> 01:41:16.546
<v Hou, Eric>So then do it with caution.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10139-0
01:41:17.646 --> 01:41:21.136
<v Hou, Eric>I'll say and different things basically
why.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10144-0
01:41:21.136 --> 01:41:22.536
<v Hou, Eric>How you doing differencing?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10163-0
01:41:22.536 --> 01:41:27.458
<v Hou, Eric>I don't like this,
but just providing you there,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10163-1
01:41:27.458 --> 01:41:34.289
<v Hou, Eric>there is a way you can make a non
stationary times into stationary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10163-2
01:41:34.289 --> 01:41:35.896
<v Hou, Eric>Just be careful.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10175-0
01:41:41.726 --> 01:41:45.277
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
And how to correlation auto correlation</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10175-1
01:41:45.277 --> 01:41:47.166
<v Hou, Eric>is basically saying that?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10182-0
01:41:49.146 --> 01:41:55.456
<v Hou, Eric>Whether or not his target data will
affect.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10200-0
01:41:57.066 --> 01:42:05.228
<v Hou, Eric>Days today's data so whether or not do
you believe whether or not a week ago</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10200-1
01:42:05.228 --> 01:42:07.666
<v Hou, Eric>stop price will affect.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10205-0
01:42:09.266 --> 01:42:10.466
<v Hou, Eric>My stock price today meaning.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10222-0
01:42:12.186 --> 01:42:19.908
<v Hou, Eric>Knowing the fact that the stock raised
one week ago would not information affect</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10222-1
01:42:19.908 --> 01:42:25.056
<v Hou, Eric>my current day stock will not go up on
this very day.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10228-0
01:42:25.616 --> 01:42:28.976
<v Hou, Eric>So then some people believe that there is
autocorrelation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10237-0
01:42:31.426 --> 01:42:34.426
<v Hou, Eric>Mean for a lot of data from heartbeat
data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10250-0
01:42:34.426 --> 01:42:38.123
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
definitely there is a auto correlation,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10250-1
01:42:38.123 --> 01:42:43.546
<v Hou, Eric>but just for a stock price data per say,
I don't believe it's it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10253-0
01:42:43.546 --> 01:42:44.306
<v Hou, Eric>Like what I said.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10281-0
01:42:44.306 --> 01:42:49.065
<v Hou, Eric>It's it could be arbitrage that you can
definitely utilize it and make some extra</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10281-1
01:42:49.065 --> 01:42:53.186
<v Hou, Eric>money if you notice notice there's some
other people also notice this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10301-0
01:42:53.816 --> 01:42:57.791
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's basically definition of
arbitrage and then people leverage take</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10301-1
01:42:57.791 --> 01:42:58.696
<v Hou, Eric>advantage of that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10305-0
01:42:58.696 --> 01:43:00.856
<v Hou, Eric>So then this out will be gone.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10316-0
01:43:01.416 --> 01:43:06.363
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I don't believe in
autocorrelation in finance data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10316-1
01:43:06.363 --> 01:43:09.136
<v Hou, Eric>especially in in in stock price data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10317-0
01:43:09.726 --> 01:43:10.846
<v Hou, Eric>But if you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10330-0
01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.666
<v Hou, Eric>If you're focusing on one simple company,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10362-0
01:43:15.666 --> 01:43:20.433
<v Hou, Eric>So then you want to analyze not companies
10K or 10Q,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10362-1
01:43:20.433 --> 01:43:27.582
<v Hou, Eric>and then you're plotting a time series
based upon 10K10Q data. Their net income,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10362-2
01:43:27.582 --> 01:43:31.466
<v Hou, Eric>right? So that their cogs,
their sgna data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10376-0
01:43:32.266 --> 01:43:36.746
<v Hou, Eric>I cannot believe that there will be
autocorrelation in that time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10400-0
01:43:37.026 --> 01:43:42.050
<v Hou, Eric>It's really case by case and then you
have to think through the reason why you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10400-1
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:46.439
<v Hou, Eric>believe there is this automation and why
don't you believe there's a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10400-2
01:43:46.439 --> 01:43:47.456
<v Hou, Eric>autocorrelation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10406-0
01:43:48.256 --> 01:43:51.816
<v Hou, Eric>So the reasoning is the key here, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10414-0
01:43:51.976 --> 01:43:55.656
<v Hou, Eric>And then you like what I said.
I'm going to show in here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10422-0
01:43:56.536 --> 01:43:58.856
<v Hou, Eric>So SP500 auto correlation?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10429-0
01:43:58.856 --> 01:44:02.736
<v Hou, Eric>So you know you, you, you, you see this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10434-0
01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.896
<v Hou, Eric>And they're so basically I'm showing you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10441-0
01:44:06.186 --> 01:44:07.946
<v Hou, Eric>A different cycle, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10452-0
01:44:07.946 --> 01:44:12.666
<v Hou, Eric>So the zero is my current data versus my
current data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10488-0
01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:18.041
<v Hou, Eric>So then definitely you have 100%
correlation, but whatever,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10488-1
01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:23.326
<v Hou, Eric>if I shift the date by one,
I'm comparing my current data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10488-2
01:44:23.326 --> 01:44:29.776
<v Hou, Eric>my current date's growth versus my
yesterday's stock or SP500 behavior.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10518-0
01:44:30.016 --> 01:44:34.499
<v Hou, Eric>Is there any positive or negative or
strong autocorrelation?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10518-1
01:44:34.499 --> 01:44:39.864
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see from the data today,
whether or not my stock go up versus</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10518-2
01:44:39.864 --> 01:44:43.098
<v Hou, Eric>yesterday,
whether or not that stock go up.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10518-3
01:44:43.098 --> 01:44:45.376
<v Hou, Eric>So there is a minor super tiny.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10524-0
01:44:45.616 --> 01:44:47.296
<v Hou, Eric>The minus correlation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10541-0
01:44:48.376 --> 01:44:51.844
<v Hou, Eric>And then I just went this cycle from zero
to 50.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10541-1
01:44:51.844 --> 01:44:55.736
<v Hou, Eric>I I give you the autocorrelation of those
time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10554-0
01:44:56.576 --> 01:45:03.656
<v Hou, Eric>What I can say is the only strong code
and code strong information I can tell is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10562-0
01:45:05.226 --> 01:45:08.346
<v Hou, Eric>It seems that there is positive
correlation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10570-0
01:45:10.266 --> 01:45:13.466
<v Hou, Eric>Of the SP500 price versus.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10581-0
01:45:15.026 --> 01:45:23.066
<v Hou, Eric>Nine days ago, SP500 price and seven.
So then those are the strongest.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10600-0
01:45:24.626 --> 01:45:30.786
<v Hou, Eric>Or two strongest positive correlation I
have ever seen from 1 to 50 days lag.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10607-0
01:45:31.906 --> 01:45:34.866
<v Hou, Eric>And those are definitely for a 80 day lag.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10614-0
01:45:34.866 --> 01:45:37.986
<v Hou, Eric>I have a pretty strong negative
correlation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10615-0
01:45:37.986 --> 01:45:39.426
<v Hou, Eric>How strong is it?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10622-0
01:45:40.466 --> 01:45:43.706
<v Hou, Eric>Less than 20%.
I don't think those are strong.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10626-0
01:45:45.826 --> 01:45:46.666
<v Hou, Eric>I hope not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10641-0
01:45:46.666 --> 01:45:50.632
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of people are going to use this
information to design any strategy</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10641-1
01:45:50.632 --> 01:45:53.946
<v Hou, Eric>because I don't think this is really
meaningful information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10651-0
01:45:55.976 --> 01:46:01.416
<v Hou, Eric>But this provides you a way to see to
check the other correlation, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10661-0
01:46:01.416 --> 01:46:04.496
<v Hou, Eric>So then to you know,
I'll show you the code how I did it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10681-0
01:46:05.296 --> 01:46:08.428
<v Hou, Eric>You can do that with your data with your
company data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10681-1
01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:13.096
<v Hou, Eric>If you focus on corporate finance that
you're doing, you're focusing one company.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10690-0
01:46:13.256 --> 01:46:17.113
<v Hou, Eric>Autocorrelation could be strong
information that you wanna have stock</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10690-1
01:46:17.113 --> 01:46:18.656
<v Hou, Eric>price investment not at all.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10693-0
01:46:21.166 --> 01:46:22.086
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions so far?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10695-0
01:46:25.676 --> 01:46:25.836
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10707-0
01:46:25.836 --> 01:46:29.884
<v Hou, Eric>Good.
So then I'm gonna show you different this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10707-1
01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:34.016
<v Hou, Eric>this is going through a history, right?
So then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10715-0
01:46:35.626 --> 01:46:37.746
<v Hou, Eric>There's other regressor autoregressive
model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10722-0
01:46:37.746 --> 01:46:39.146
<v Hou, Eric>So what does this model mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10737-0
01:46:39.146 --> 01:46:43.953
<v Hou, Eric>It's meaning like I can use my
yesterday's information to predict my</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10737-1
01:46:43.953 --> 01:46:45.346
<v Hou, Eric>today's information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10755-0
01:46:45.546 --> 01:46:49.265
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
I can use my yesterday's stock price,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10755-1
01:46:49.265 --> 01:46:52.984
<v Hou, Eric>star price,
start price and end the price or close</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10755-2
01:46:52.984 --> 01:46:55.026
<v Hou, Eric>price to predict my today's.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10760-0
01:46:56.746 --> 01:46:58.336
<v Hou, Eric>Close price for example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10763-0
01:47:00.106 --> 01:47:01.066
<v Hou, Eric>People believe in that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10769-0
01:47:03.586 --> 01:47:05.626
<v Hou, Eric>So that's basically this formula is
telling you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10778-0
01:47:08.586 --> 01:47:12.986
<v Hou, Eric>The output depends on its own previous
values.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10793-0
01:47:17.096 --> 01:47:22.905
<v Hou, Eric>If if your signal, for example,
you're analyzing a company's sgna you're</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10793-1
01:47:22.905 --> 01:47:24.496
<v Hou, Eric>analyzing companies.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10837-0
01:47:27.026 --> 01:47:32.626
<v Hou, Eric>Receivables right, account receivables,
if you do see there is a strong</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10837-1
01:47:32.626 --> 01:47:37.448
<v Hou, Eric>AutoNation say if t -,
1 yesterday's or or last month or last</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10837-2
01:47:37.448 --> 01:47:43.514
<v Hou, Eric>quarter's account receivable has a really
strong correlation with the current</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10837-3
01:47:43.514 --> 01:47:48.570
<v Hou, Eric>account receivables. Yes,
this model will help you to understand</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10837-4
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.736
<v Hou, Eric>that company's.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10862-0
01:47:49.736 --> 01:47:55.736
<v Hou, Eric>Business cycle it could be a really good
insight for stock price as we don't see</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10862-1
01:47:55.736 --> 01:48:00.329
<v Hou, Eric>any auto correlation.
The prediction using this model will be</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10862-2
01:48:00.329 --> 01:48:01.736
<v Hou, Eric>really, really bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10863-0
01:48:01.736 --> 01:48:02.216
<v Hou, Eric>How bad?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10867-0
01:48:02.216 --> 01:48:03.096
<v Hou, Eric>How bad is this?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10868-0
01:48:03.096 --> 01:48:03.896
<v Hou, Eric>Is like this bad.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10876-0
01:48:04.376 --> 01:48:08.136
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think anyone should be using this,
I'm really.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10896-0
01:48:11.336 --> 01:48:18.381
<v Hou, Eric>I'm cutting off right my training model
for SP500 using any data before 2024</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10896-1
01:48:18.381 --> 01:48:19.296
<v Hou, Eric>September.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10914-0
01:48:19.856 --> 01:48:22.946
<v Hou, Eric>I'm asking this model. OK,
let me to train AR model to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10914-1
01:48:22.946 --> 01:48:27.496
<v Hou, Eric>autoregressive model and then let me just
predict the stock price going forward.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10930-0
01:48:29.106 --> 01:48:34.746
<v Hou, Eric>Mean you you can see this mean absolute
percentage errors as low as 2%, no?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10962-0
01:48:36.466 --> 01:48:40.517
<v Hou, Eric>Here is a huge gap when SP500 is this
high.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10962-1
01:48:40.517 --> 01:48:47.513
<v Hou, Eric>I'm putting in this low so it is not
usable for any portfolio optimization.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10962-2
01:48:47.513 --> 01:48:52.576
<v Hou, Eric>OK so so it's not performing great,
it is as expected.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10973-0
01:48:57.016 --> 01:49:00.652
<v Hou, Eric>This this moving average model is even
worse in my opinion,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/10973-1
01:49:00.652 --> 01:49:03.016
<v Hou, Eric>because it just basically assumed that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11015-0
01:49:04.946 --> 01:49:10.138
<v Hou, Eric>It just basically assumed that the
predict by the way #1 it's moving average</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11015-1
01:49:10.138 --> 01:49:15.194
<v Hou, Eric>model so then don't confuse this one with
a concept called moving average.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11015-2
01:49:15.194 --> 01:49:20.520
<v Hou, Eric>This moving average MA model has nothing
to do with the stat concept of moving</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11015-3
01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.026
<v Hou, Eric>average which is basically calculating
the average.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11034-0
01:49:24.426 --> 01:49:29.806
<v Hou, Eric>This moving average is saying that, hey,
I believe the historical forecast errors</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11034-1
01:49:29.806 --> 01:49:32.496
<v Hou, Eric>has something to do with my future price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11042-0
01:49:33.046 --> 01:49:36.486
<v Hou, Eric>So then the regressors are the predicting
with errors.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11060-0
01:49:39.346 --> 01:49:44.706
<v Hou, Eric>The part I can say it makes some sense is
if you have some information that got.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11066-0
01:49:46.826 --> 01:49:47.666
<v Hou, Eric>Not explained in history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11077-0
01:49:47.946 --> 01:49:52.357
<v Hou, Eric>So then basically you are using those
errors as a proxy of unexplained</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11077-1
01:49:52.357 --> 01:49:53.786
<v Hou, Eric>information in history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11085-0
01:49:57.986 --> 01:50:00.826
<v Hou, Eric>So for finance, it's even worse than that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11090-0
01:50:01.066 --> 01:50:04.586
<v Hou, Eric>So I train the model using the same data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11095-0
01:50:06.146 --> 01:50:08.266
<v Hou, Eric>Here is a prediction, and here's actual.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11102-0
01:50:10.106 --> 01:50:11.506
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think this is useful.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11111-0
01:50:13.266 --> 01:50:17.010
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
And the more important thing is that this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11111-1
01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:17.986
<v Hou, Eric>ARIMA model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11132-0
01:50:19.626 --> 01:50:24.969
<v Hou, Eric>This ARIMA model I hope you have heard
this model because this ARIMA model is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11132-1
01:50:24.969 --> 01:50:29.626
<v Hou, Eric>really Arkansas autoregressive
differencing and the moving average.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11141-0
01:50:29.826 --> 01:50:34.266
<v Hou, Eric>This model is a combination of Arkansas
model and a moving average model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11166-0
01:50:34.966 --> 01:50:40.182
<v Hou, Eric>So that's one one point that you don't
want to even try the auto regressive</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11166-1
01:50:40.182 --> 01:50:45.879
<v Hou, Eric>model and machine learning model because
this model this ARIMA model is dominating</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11166-2
01:50:45.879 --> 01:50:47.046
<v Hou, Eric>those two models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11186-0
01:50:48.586 --> 01:50:52.784
<v Hou, Eric>So this model is basically a combination
of those two models and it's getting more</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11186-1
01:50:52.784 --> 01:50:56.172
<v Hou, Eric>and more powerful because it has more
regressors to in your model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11186-2
01:50:56.172 --> 01:50:57.386
<v Hou, Eric>In this agreement model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11197-0
01:51:00.766 --> 01:51:04.326
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really very widely used
model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11202-0
01:51:04.326 --> 01:51:07.926
<v Hou, Eric>And so you just need to know.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11220-0
01:51:08.886 --> 01:51:14.093
<v Hou, Eric>You just need to know some information
about autoregressive auto correlation and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11220-1
01:51:14.093 --> 01:51:17.886
<v Hou, Eric>use that information to find a proper PDQ
in this formula.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11226-0
01:51:19.426 --> 01:51:21.226
<v Hou, Eric>The algorithm gonna find that for you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11249-0
01:51:23.146 --> 01:51:25.656
<v Hou, Eric>But for stock price,
it just feeds single line.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11249-1
01:51:25.656 --> 01:51:28.479
<v Hou, Eric>If you zoom in you can see this is not a
single line,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11249-2
01:51:28.479 --> 01:51:31.616
<v Hou, Eric>but if you zoom out like this,
it looks like a single line.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11251-0
01:51:31.616 --> 01:51:33.056
<v Hou, Eric>Is it's not useful either.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11261-0
01:51:34.946 --> 01:51:38.896
<v Hou, Eric>Umm, another one is signal a remote model?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11265-0
01:51:38.896 --> 01:51:41.176
<v Hou, Eric>So this model is dominating ARIMA.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11277-0
01:51:41.616 --> 01:51:46.034
<v Hou, Eric>So you can see from the Times series
model the future model,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11277-1
01:51:46.034 --> 01:51:48.496
<v Hou, Eric>more reason models are dominating.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11299-0
01:51:50.426 --> 01:51:55.183
<v Hou, Eric>Previous models,
so the seasonal is just basically a rima</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11299-1
01:51:55.183 --> 01:52:01.826
<v Hou, Eric>model plus a seasonal piece so that you
can model automatically the seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11307-0
01:52:04.026 --> 01:52:05.586
<v Hou, Eric>Again apply to SP500.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11311-0
01:52:05.986 --> 01:52:07.706
<v Hou, Eric>Not great. OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11317-0
01:52:08.026 --> 01:52:11.906
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so those are the family of Arima models.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11325-0
01:52:13.706 --> 01:52:16.266
<v Hou, Eric>So if I may make a suggestion.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11369-0
01:52:17.106 --> 01:52:23.087
<v Hou, Eric>So although I'm saying that those models
are now so great with the SP500 data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11369-1
01:52:23.087 --> 01:52:28.311
<v Hou, Eric>but those are still good models that you
can use for other purposes.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11369-2
01:52:28.311 --> 01:52:33.081
<v Hou, Eric>Another use cases say in inventory
optimization, if you're in,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11369-3
01:52:33.081 --> 01:52:36.866
<v Hou, Eric>if you're use case in the inventory
optimization.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11377-0
01:52:38.426 --> 01:52:41.226
<v Hou, Eric>Almost all companies are using a rima
model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11389-0
01:52:42.946 --> 01:52:48.258
<v Hou, Eric>At least to use it as a benchmark,
it's really good model on that in that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11389-1
01:52:48.258 --> 01:52:51.416
<v Hou, Eric>area and and in that for for that use
case.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11425-0
01:52:53.146 --> 01:52:58.399
<v Hou, Eric>And and if you want to use for example
focus on one single company's performance</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11425-1
01:52:58.399 --> 01:53:01.835
<v Hou, Eric>in history,
a rima model will be your starting point</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11425-2
01:53:01.835 --> 01:53:06.893
<v Hou, Eric>if that. If that history is a time series,
that's definitely going to be your</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11425-3
01:53:06.893 --> 01:53:07.866
<v Hou, Eric>starting point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11428-0
01:53:08.106 --> 01:53:11.106
<v Hou, Eric>Just don't use this model on stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11432-0
01:53:12.706 --> 01:53:13.666
<v Hou, Eric>In this model is not good.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11435-0
01:53:16.296 --> 01:53:16.736
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11451-0
01:53:16.736 --> 01:53:21.069
<v Hou, Eric>So then another big family of a time
series model is exponential smoothing</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11451-1
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.416
<v Hou, Eric>model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11454-0
01:53:21.416 --> 01:53:23.856
<v Hou, Eric>So it's also quite easy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11474-0
01:53:24.136 --> 01:53:30.621
<v Hou, Eric>So is it consider we can fit in
exponential, exponential linear model,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11474-1
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:35.096
<v Hou, Eric>so then so then you can smooth the signal
a bit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11483-0
01:53:35.336 --> 01:53:38.296
<v Hou, Eric>That's how you you have this ETS model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11484-0
01:53:38.296 --> 01:53:39.416
<v Hou, Eric>I'll I'll have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11490-0
01:53:39.456 --> 01:53:41.216
<v Hou, Eric>I think Devi has some chart I'm gonna
show you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11510-0
01:53:42.576 --> 01:53:47.039
<v Hou, Eric>Umm,
so eventually the the the exponential</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11510-1
01:53:47.039 --> 01:53:54.096
<v Hou, Eric>smoothing model gonna give you are some
smoothed trend information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11516-0
01:53:55.666 --> 01:53:57.826
<v Hou, Eric>It will tell you,
based upon history whether.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11527-0
01:53:59.746 --> 01:54:03.226
<v Hou, Eric>Your time series will go training up or
training down.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11535-0
01:54:03.706 --> 01:54:06.666
<v Hou, Eric>That's pretty much how you use
exponential smoothing model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11548-0
01:54:08.466 --> 01:54:14.025
<v Hou, Eric>In real life, how we, you know,
a data scientist will use an exponential</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11548-1
01:54:14.025 --> 01:54:14.786
<v Hou, Eric>smoothing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11598-0
01:54:16.586 --> 01:54:22.493
<v Hou, Eric>Is to really use this exponential
smoothing to create some benchmark</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11598-1
01:54:22.493 --> 01:54:29.170
<v Hou, Eric>predictions in the future and use those
benchmark predictions as a feature to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11598-2
01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:36.275
<v Hou, Eric>help more advanced machine learning model
to learn, at least from one perspective,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11598-3
01:54:36.275 --> 01:54:42.096
<v Hou, Eric>how the future forecast will look like.
So you can actually use it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11610-0
01:54:42.096 --> 01:54:47.016
<v Hou, Eric>As a benchmark for more often that we are
just using it to create features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11642-0
01:54:47.866 --> 01:54:53.535
<v Hou, Eric>So for example like I want to use this I
I can use this exponential smoothing and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11642-1
01:54:53.535 --> 01:54:59.135
<v Hou, Eric>then create my prediction of future and
then for a newer network model I can use</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11642-2
01:54:59.135 --> 01:55:04.666
<v Hou, Eric>it and to predict the future and then you
can also build a tree model and then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11653-0
01:55:04.666 --> 01:55:08.946
<v Hou, Eric>Use this as a as a input for the tree
model to predict your future.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11662-0
01:55:09.746 --> 01:55:13.786
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say your future inventory and your
future account receivables.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11691-0
01:55:15.346 --> 01:55:19.513
<v Hou, Eric>That's 100% doable and then and then
going to provide some really positive</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11691-1
01:55:19.513 --> 01:55:22.179
<v Hou, Eric>value,
but just rely on this model and give you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11691-2
01:55:22.179 --> 01:55:23.346
<v Hou, Eric>high accurate result.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11693-0
01:55:23.346 --> 01:55:25.506
<v Hou, Eric>That's sometimes. It's really,
really tricky.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11696-0
01:55:26.616 --> 01:55:26.976
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11704-0
01:55:27.696 --> 01:55:32.296
<v Hou, Eric>So usually like people using those as as
as features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11712-0
01:55:36.756 --> 01:55:39.316
<v Hou, Eric>And also there is another thing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11721-0
01:55:39.316 --> 01:55:44.356
<v Hou, Eric>So causal analysis in time series what?
What causal analysis really means is that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11724-0
01:55:46.626 --> 01:55:47.386
<v Hou, Eric>For example.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11748-0
01:55:48.986 --> 01:55:55.507
<v Hou, Eric>In in the inventory optimization problem,
some people believe that price is A1</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11748-1
01:55:55.507 --> 01:55:58.066
<v Hou, Eric>causal variable of high demand.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11761-0
01:55:58.626 --> 01:56:02.020
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
if you guys to come micro economy,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11761-1
01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.866
<v Hou, Eric>you know that if you know if the price
elasticity.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11769-0
01:56:08.016 --> 01:56:10.256
<v Hou, Eric>Is is inactive mean right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11781-0
01:56:10.256 --> 01:56:16.976
<v Hou, Eric>So then it that means if I raise my price
and then my my my unit sales will.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11809-0
01:56:18.546 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Hou, Eric>Highly likely go down right so that if I
if I reduce my price,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11809-1
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:28.666
<v Hou, Eric>my unit sales number of products I sold
will go up.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11819-0
01:56:28.986 --> 01:56:34.146
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's that's that's that gives
us a negative price elasticity.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11863-0
01:56:34.906 --> 01:56:42.046
<v Hou, Eric>So then now means the unit cells go up or
go down a number of products that you can</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11863-1
01:56:42.046 --> 01:56:46.211
<v Hou, Eric>sell has.
The reliance has a a dependency on the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11863-2
01:56:46.211 --> 01:56:52.841
<v Hou, Eric>price because the price up and down
caused the up and down of the unit cells.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11863-3
01:56:52.841 --> 01:56:54.626
<v Hou, Eric>A number of unit you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11868-0
01:56:54.626 --> 01:56:55.306
<v Hou, Eric>Can sell.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11874-0
01:56:55.746 --> 01:56:59.706
<v Hou, Eric>So then that price is a causal factor.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11881-0
01:57:00.506 --> 01:57:02.986
<v Hou, Eric>For the unit sales, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11888-0
01:57:03.306 --> 01:57:07.096
<v Hou, Eric>So then you whenever you predict for
example like.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11894-0
01:57:08.666 --> 01:57:09.706
<v Hou, Eric>Video games as an example, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11911-0
01:57:09.706 --> 01:57:13.001
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you do see a discount during
Thanksgiving,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11911-1
01:57:13.001 --> 01:57:16.906
<v Hou, Eric>a lot of people may buy the video games
or or or console units.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11918-0
01:57:18.586 --> 01:57:19.786
<v Hou, Eric>Surprise is playing a role.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11932-0
01:57:20.626 --> 01:57:24.986
<v Hou, Eric>So then you definitely want to have the
price as an information in your model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11938-0
01:57:24.986 --> 01:57:30.026
<v Hou, Eric>So they're definitely going to drive more
accurate predictions, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11941-0
01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:34.056
<v Hou, Eric>One question.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11952-0
01:57:34.096 --> 01:57:40.176
<v Hou, Eric>Do you guys think that price is a causal
factor for revenue?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11965-0
01:57:51.636 --> 01:57:55.156
<v Benbenek, MATT>Like the the price you sell something at.
Is that a causal factor?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11970-0
01:57:55.156 --> 01:57:56.716
<v Benbenek, MATT>For how much revenue you get?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11986-0
01:57:57.236 --> 01:58:00.206
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.
So for example like whether you changed</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11986-1
01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:03.836
<v Hou, Eric>our price up or down,
how does it affect your revenue?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11994-0
01:58:05.986 --> 01:58:07.786
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah, definitely a causal factor.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11993-0
01:58:09.136 --> 01:58:09.416
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/11998-0
01:58:09.416 --> 01:58:11.336
<v Hou, Eric>So let me ask you a quick question.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12011-0
01:58:14.266 --> 01:58:22.426
<v Hou, Eric>So if you if you raise your price, Matt,
if you raise your price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12019-0
01:58:24.066 --> 01:58:26.866
<v Hou, Eric>Does it drive your revenue higher or
lower?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12023-0
01:58:29.176 --> 01:58:30.736
<v Benbenek, MATT>Depends how much you raise your price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12035-0
01:58:32.086 --> 01:58:36.546
<v Hou, Eric>Sure. Why? Why?
Why does it depend on how much you raise</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12035-1
01:58:36.546 --> 01:58:37.406
<v Hou, Eric>your price?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12044-0
01:58:38.186 --> 01:58:41.109
<v Benbenek, MATT>'Cause, if you raise it a little,
you might make more money.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12044-1
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:42.546
<v Benbenek, MATT>If it doesn't drive off sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12057-0
01:58:42.546 --> 01:58:44.906
<v Benbenek, MATT>But if you raise it too much,
people might stop buying it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12054-0
01:58:45.436 --> 01:58:46.796
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, exactly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12080-0
01:58:46.956 --> 01:58:54.105
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you raise your price too much,
you have your number of products getting</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12080-1
01:58:54.105 --> 01:58:59.876
<v Hou, Eric>much lower than the price you raise
because the revenue is priced.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12091-0
01:58:59.876 --> 01:59:05.716
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply the number of unit of your
product so you can sell.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12099-0
01:59:05.996 --> 01:59:09.916
<v Hou, Eric>So then, if price rises, for example 25%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12121-0
01:59:10.706 --> 01:59:17.164
<v Hou, Eric>But you have 30% lower unit sales,
so that you eventually gonna end up with</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12121-1
01:59:17.164 --> 01:59:23.196
<v Hou, Eric>a negative negative growth of umm revenue
which is not optimal, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12125-0
01:59:23.436 --> 01:59:24.596
<v Hou, Eric>But right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12139-0
01:59:24.596 --> 01:59:27.774
<v Hou, Eric>Similarly,
if you reduce the price too much,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12139-1
01:59:27.774 --> 01:59:30.316
<v Hou, Eric>let's say I reduce the price by 25%.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12149-0
01:59:30.876 --> 01:59:34.396
<v Hou, Eric>But my price elasticity is not that
significant.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12154-0
01:59:34.396 --> 01:59:35.156
<v Hou, Eric>It's less than.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12157-0
01:59:35.156 --> 01:59:36.596
<v Hou, Eric>Well, it's bigger than -1.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12170-0
01:59:36.596 --> 01:59:41.156
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can now raise as high as 25%
units sales or more.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12177-0
01:59:42.706 --> 01:59:45.186
<v Hou, Eric>I only raise 20% units sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12194-0
01:59:46.826 --> 01:59:51.546
<v Hou, Eric>Higher so then I have a -, 25 -,
25% from my price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12204-0
01:59:52.056 --> 01:59:55.216
<v Hou, Eric>I have only +20% from my uni sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12214-0
01:59:55.496 --> 02:00:01.296
<v Hou, Eric>I end up with -5% of revenue,
which means I'm losing money in theory.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12238-0
02:00:03.226 --> 02:00:12.586
<v Hou, Eric>So it's really really tricky to say that
price may cause the revenue changes,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12238-1
02:00:12.586 --> 02:00:15.586
<v Hou, Eric>but sometimes it may not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12273-0
02:00:16.146 --> 02:00:21.686
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's very important point I
want to make is if your manager,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12273-1
02:00:21.686 --> 02:00:25.744
<v Hou, Eric>the first one asks you guys to predict
for example,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12273-2
02:00:25.744 --> 02:00:31.596
<v Hou, Eric>my sales my my financial stability,
you know you wanna know the money that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12273-3
02:00:31.596 --> 02:00:37.136
<v Hou, Eric>you can earn from your clients, your,
your customers your, your, your.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12279-0
02:00:37.176 --> 02:00:39.136
<v Hou, Eric>Your customer companies or individuals?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12295-0
02:00:41.286 --> 02:00:49.461
<v Hou, Eric>First thing is you need to make sure that
you understand there is a direct 100%</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12295-1
02:00:49.461 --> 02:00:50.176
<v Hou, Eric>causal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12315-0
02:00:51.746 --> 02:00:57.141
<v Hou, Eric>Causal factor between price and unit
sales 100% one go down,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12315-1
02:00:57.141 --> 02:00:59.706
<v Hou, Eric>the another one should go up.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12323-0
02:01:00.826 --> 02:01:04.548
<v Hou, Eric>Assuming we're not,
we're assuming we're not selling those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12323-1
02:01:04.548 --> 02:01:05.746
<v Hou, Eric>luxury bags, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12362-0
02:01:05.746 --> 02:01:09.809
<v Hou, Eric>So then those guys,
they have positive price elasticity,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12362-1
02:01:09.809 --> 02:01:13.800
<v Hou, Eric>meaning you raise your price more,
you have more sales,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12362-2
02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.506
<v Hou, Eric>which is kind of bizarre and not a
regular product.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12362-3
02:01:17.506 --> 02:01:23.422
<v Hou, Eric>We are selling usually assuming you know
the price of your products you're selling</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12362-4
02:01:23.422 --> 02:01:25.346
<v Hou, Eric>or your company is selling.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12379-0
02:01:26.146 --> 02:01:32.274
<v Hou, Eric>Assume that the price less DC is negative,
meaning lower price will drive higher</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12379-1
02:01:32.274 --> 02:01:33.106
<v Hou, Eric>unit sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12383-0
02:01:33.856 --> 02:01:36.656
<v Hou, Eric>Our higher price will drive lower unit
sales.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12392-0
02:01:38.466 --> 02:01:43.586
<v Hou, Eric>You should predict unit sales instead of
revenue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12401-0
02:01:45.266 --> 02:01:48.706
<v Hou, Eric>You have the unit sales predicted based
upon.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12425-0
02:01:50.626 --> 02:01:55.356
<v Hou, Eric>Your assumed discount or lower price or
higher price you're gonna offer to the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12425-1
02:01:55.356 --> 02:01:59.307
<v Hou, Eric>customers, the product,
the multiplication gonna give you revenue</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12425-2
02:01:59.307 --> 02:01:59.786
<v Hou, Eric>anyways.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12442-0
02:02:01.506 --> 02:02:05.883
<v Hou, Eric>And that is a more accurate way to
predict the future,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12442-1
02:02:05.883 --> 02:02:10.976
<v Hou, Eric>then just use the price to predict the
future revenue directly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12448-0
02:02:12.546 --> 02:02:13.866
<v Hou, Eric>But now it's more scientifically.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12450-0
02:02:15.546 --> 02:02:15.586
<v Hou, Eric>Solid.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12468-0
02:02:17.226 --> 02:02:22.026
<v Hou, Eric>Approach.
So just keep in mind some differences</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12468-1
02:02:22.026 --> 02:02:27.226
<v Hou, Eric>that you need to know the the causality,
causality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12473-0
02:02:29.066 --> 02:02:30.866
<v Hou, Eric>Factor between 2 signals.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12482-0
02:02:32.626 --> 02:02:36.386
<v Hou, Eric>It may not be that obvious,
and sometimes it can be really confusing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12501-0
02:02:38.436 --> 02:02:46.496
<v Hou, Eric>And also one one key point I wanna make
is that the correlation does not imply</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12501-1
02:02:46.496 --> 02:02:47.516
<v Hou, Eric>causation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12503-0
02:02:49.586 --> 02:02:50.266
<v Hou, Eric>What does that mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12512-0
02:02:52.026 --> 02:02:53.986
<v Hou, Eric>You may have some signal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12519-0
02:02:53.986 --> 02:02:57.626
<v Hou, Eric>Have a really positive correlation you
believe?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12525-0
02:02:59.226 --> 02:03:00.426
<v Hou, Eric>That is driving your business.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12530-0
02:03:02.906 --> 02:03:04.706
<v Hou, Eric>That could be just a coincidence.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12536-0
02:03:06.466 --> 02:03:09.586
<v Hou, Eric>Unless you you have to go into.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12551-0
02:03:11.386 --> 02:03:16.596
<v Hou, Eric>You know the qualitative part of that
information to run through what does.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12559-0
02:03:16.676 --> 02:03:19.156
<v Hou, Eric>What does that information even mean?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12566-0
02:03:19.796 --> 02:03:24.156
<v Hou, Eric>So you need to prove that that is a
causal variable.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12570-0
02:03:24.236 --> 02:03:26.116
<v Hou, Eric>There is a causation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12583-0
02:03:26.316 --> 02:03:29.754
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can use that information,
but sometimes it's really,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12583-1
02:03:29.754 --> 02:03:31.076
<v Hou, Eric>really hard I understand.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12591-0
02:03:31.396 --> 02:03:37.236
<v Hou, Eric>So that is why you will want always to
use out of sample test.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12594-0
02:03:38.786 --> 02:03:39.666
<v Hou, Eric>At least to prove.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12622-0
02:03:41.426 --> 02:03:48.177
<v Hou, Eric>This correlation does have some causality
or causation that you can try to use that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12622-1
02:03:48.177 --> 02:03:54.606
<v Hou, Eric>the other task out of sample task can
provide you some quantifiable evidence of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12622-2
02:03:54.606 --> 02:03:56.856
<v Hou, Eric>that causation relationship.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12650-0
02:03:58.426 --> 02:04:05.439
<v Hou, Eric>And and always do that and do your due
diligence from the meaning the definition</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12650-1
02:04:05.439 --> 02:04:12.106
<v Hou, Eric>perspective and and use auto sample to
quantify that causality relationship.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12659-0
02:04:12.856 --> 02:04:14.096
<v Hou, Eric>Uh. Causation relationship.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12664-0
02:04:14.496 --> 02:04:17.696
<v Hou, Eric>That's the two umm advices.
I'll definitely give it to you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12669-0
02:04:19.266 --> 02:04:21.466
<v Hou, Eric>Because this kind of correlation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12679-0
02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:27.456
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.
Correlation and causation kind of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12679-1
02:04:27.456 --> 02:04:28.456
<v Hou, Eric>confusion.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12687-0
02:04:29.096 --> 02:04:32.416
<v Hou, Eric>Uh really happen in your in my real life.
Uh. Examples.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12713-0
02:04:33.986 --> 02:04:39.645
<v Hou, Eric>That definitely caused a lot of
overfeeding problems that caused the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12713-1
02:04:39.645 --> 02:04:46.124
<v Hou, Eric>business significant amount of money to
eventually get rid of underdress those</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12713-2
02:04:46.124 --> 02:04:47.026
<v Hou, Eric>issues, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12724-0
02:04:48.746 --> 02:04:49.746
<v Hou, Eric>So this is going to a key point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12726-0
02:04:49.746 --> 02:04:51.066
<v Hou, Eric>Correlation in causation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12731-0
02:04:51.066 --> 02:04:54.266
<v Hou, Eric>This is something that you can help
business to distinguish.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12740-0
02:04:56.676 --> 02:05:01.876
<v Hou, Eric>One package I will highly recommend is
the profit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12746-0
02:05:03.426 --> 02:05:05.546
<v Hou, Eric>It is from. It's from oh.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12755-0
02:05:05.626 --> 02:05:07.666
<v Hou, Eric>Why do I just put it in the process?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12760-0
02:05:07.986 --> 02:05:09.586
<v Hou, Eric>So these are from MADA.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12766-0
02:05:10.186 --> 02:05:13.586
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really established package
that you can use.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12782-0
02:05:15.346 --> 02:05:20.535
<v Hou, Eric>You can use this package for your daily
data. You can use it for weekly data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12782-1
02:05:20.535 --> 02:05:21.666
<v Hou, Eric>for monthly data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12816-0
02:05:23.306 --> 02:05:28.616
<v Hou, Eric>And and for the data was different
frequency and you this this this the man</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12816-1
02:05:28.616 --> 02:05:34.066
<v Hou, Eric>of profit can handle different patterns,
different seasonality automatically.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12816-2
02:05:34.066 --> 02:05:38.189
<v Hou, Eric>This is a really,
really powerful package that you want to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12816-3
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:39.726
<v Hou, Eric>use in your real life.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12843-0
02:05:41.266 --> 02:05:45.430
<v Hou, Eric>If after this class you forgot those all
the Arima, you don't lose anything.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12843-1
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:49.919
<v Hou, Eric>Just if you know how to use meta Prophet.
A lot of companies are actually using it</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12843-2
02:05:49.919 --> 02:05:51.866
<v Hou, Eric>and they're really, really powerful.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12875-0
02:05:52.026 --> 02:05:55.881
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can save the money to
purchase some, you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12875-1
02:05:55.881 --> 02:06:01.020
<v Hou, Eric>software and then you can just doing this
is open source and then is 100% free.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12875-2
02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:05.517
<v Hou, Eric>And so very, very powerful.
And the matter is using this software for</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12875-3
02:06:05.517 --> 02:06:06.866
<v Hou, Eric>their own prediction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12884-0
02:06:07.306 --> 02:06:12.306
<v Hou, Eric>So and also even,
even Amazon introduced their own.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12902-0
02:06:12.786 --> 02:06:19.414
<v Hou, Eric>Their own match time series packages
their their their benchmarking the uh,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12902-1
02:06:19.414 --> 02:06:20.896
<v Hou, Eric>the Meta Prophet.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12913-0
02:06:20.896 --> 02:06:26.536
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really establish a mature uh
time series uh module you can use.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12917-0
02:06:28.226 --> 02:06:29.626
<v Hou, Eric>So it has a lot of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12934-0
02:06:31.266 --> 02:06:35.273
<v Hou, Eric>Built in seasonality components,
holiday components and you can even</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12934-1
02:06:35.273 --> 02:06:36.666
<v Hou, Eric>define your changepoint.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12946-0
02:06:38.506 --> 02:06:41.426
<v Hou, Eric>For for the new data,
scientists join my team.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12960-0
02:06:41.426 --> 02:06:46.106
<v Hou, Eric>I literally asked them to read these meta
prophets user manual.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12965-0
02:06:46.906 --> 02:06:48.106
<v Hou, Eric>So then they got used to it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12973-0
02:06:48.106 --> 02:06:51.856
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really go to model that you
want to do. You want to use.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/12979-0
02:06:52.256 --> 02:06:53.736
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just show you one thing right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13003-0
02:06:53.736 --> 02:06:58.770
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so when you train a model,
the model gonna tell you the trend and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13003-1
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:04.140
<v Hou, Eric>the gonna tell you how different features
they're gonna automatically build in.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13003-2
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.616
<v Hou, Eric>Some features for you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13012-0
02:07:05.856 --> 02:07:08.296
<v Hou, Eric>How those features gonna vary?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13023-0
02:07:08.296 --> 02:07:13.576
<v Hou, Eric>How those features gonna affect your
forecast from the daily and yearly trend?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13064-0
02:07:15.426 --> 02:07:19.782
<v Hou, Eric>Perspective.
And then you can actually try to use that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13064-1
02:07:19.782 --> 02:07:25.484
<v Hou, Eric>to predict SP500 from this data.
I see this much better than the ARIMA.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13064-2
02:07:25.484 --> 02:07:31.740
<v Hou, Eric>But still I don't recommend using anytime
series model to predict a stop price</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13064-3
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:36.096
<v Hou, Eric>because I don't think that'll work.
But these in case.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13078-0
02:07:36.096 --> 02:07:39.305
<v Hou, Eric>You want to do that in case you do have
some information in case some days you do</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13078-1
02:07:39.305 --> 02:07:39.696
<v Hou, Eric>find some.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13103-0
02:07:41.266 --> 02:07:45.122
<v Hou, Eric>Information that driving some specific
company's stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13103-1
02:07:45.122 --> 02:07:50.036
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not saying that I I don't recommend
you to predict the general stock price</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13103-2
02:07:50.036 --> 02:07:52.026
<v Hou, Eric>without knowing any information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13111-0
02:07:52.026 --> 02:07:54.066
<v Hou, Eric>You just say, hey,
I have a machine learning model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13118-0
02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:55.706
<v Hou, Eric>I just wanna know the stock price.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13122-0
02:07:55.706 --> 02:07:56.346
<v Hou, Eric>You won't.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13150-0
02:07:56.786 --> 02:08:01.678
<v Hou, Eric>But if you if you're doing some research
on one specific company or or set of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13150-1
02:08:01.678 --> 02:08:06.883
<v Hou, Eric>companies you know a lot of information,
you can extract a lot of information that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13150-2
02:08:06.883 --> 02:08:10.896
<v Hou, Eric>driving their stock price,
let's say in the ideal world, right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13167-0
02:08:10.896 --> 02:08:17.524
<v Hou, Eric>So then from an API you can extract from
the latest the greatest news that in the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13167-1
02:08:17.524 --> 02:08:18.656
<v Hou, Eric>world you can.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13189-0
02:08:18.656 --> 02:08:23.624
<v Hou, Eric>You can do the sentiment analysis of
those news coming here and then you can</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13189-1
02:08:23.624 --> 02:08:26.656
<v Hou, Eric>convert those news in real time into the
data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13216-0
02:08:27.466 --> 02:08:31.896
<v Hou, Eric>That you can put into a a time series
model or whatever model,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13216-1
02:08:31.896 --> 02:08:37.520
<v Hou, Eric>and you can you can make sense of those
information to drive stock price up and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13216-2
02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.614
<v Hou, Eric>down.
If that happens then you can actually</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13216-3
02:08:40.614 --> 02:08:41.176
<v Hou, Eric>predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13228-0
02:08:42.746 --> 02:08:45.586
<v Hou, Eric>That company's stock price with a really
high accuracy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13229-0
02:08:45.586 --> 02:08:45.626
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13239-0
02:08:45.626 --> 02:08:50.512
<v Hou, Eric>I'm confident on that,
but for now that will require a lot of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13239-1
02:08:50.512 --> 02:08:50.906
<v Hou, Eric>work.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13265-0
02:08:52.626 --> 02:08:57.851
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think that will happen in a short
time and then so it's hard,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13265-1
02:08:57.851 --> 02:09:03.896
<v Hou, Eric>but maybe some high frequency trading
firms, they're already using that so then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13306-0
02:09:05.706 --> 02:09:11.326
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then that's that's a maybe one
example that the human human regular</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13306-1
02:09:11.326 --> 02:09:16.875
<v Hou, Eric>investor cannot be those agencies because
they already have those information</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13306-2
02:09:16.875 --> 02:09:22.638
<v Hou, Eric>behind seen their models could be really
accurate and those are their top secret</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13306-3
02:09:22.638 --> 02:09:26.906
<v Hou, Eric>and then individual investor like you and
me cannot really.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13310-0
02:09:26.906 --> 02:09:28.346
<v Hou, Eric>Be that model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13316-0
02:09:29.426 --> 02:09:31.346
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13319-0
02:09:31.346 --> 02:09:33.466
<v Hou, Eric>Another reason you should purchase ETFs.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13335-0
02:09:36.406 --> 02:09:39.618
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So then they, you know,
there's a meta prophet gonna provide you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13335-1
02:09:39.618 --> 02:09:41.246
<v Hou, Eric>a lot of information for you to use.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13343-0
02:09:41.446 --> 02:09:44.886
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just show you how actually you're
gonna use that model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13345-0
02:09:52.046 --> 02:09:53.086
<v Hou, Eric>I'm gonna start up.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13376-0
02:10:13.506 --> 02:10:16.988
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So what you do is you from this stand</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13376-1
02:10:16.988 --> 02:10:20.548
<v Hou, Eric>models stand model's gonna give you a lot
of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13376-2
02:10:20.548 --> 02:10:25.346
<v Hou, Eric>It's a API gonna give you a lot of time
series models, right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13390-0
02:10:25.346 --> 02:10:32.636
<v Hou, Eric>And then you have to install all these.
This profit you gonna you gonna download</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13390-1
02:10:32.636 --> 02:10:32.906
<v Hou, Eric>it?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13407-0
02:10:32.906 --> 02:10:37.962
<v Hou, Eric>Download this package from Facebook and
then so you can you can import this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13407-1
02:10:37.962 --> 02:10:39.226
<v Hou, Eric>profit model right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13408-0
02:10:39.226 --> 02:10:39.666
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13419-0
02:10:40.466 --> 02:10:42.866
<v Hou, Eric>What I did is just as you use SP500 data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13426-0
02:10:45.716 --> 02:10:47.676
<v Hou, Eric>Because the profit is quite big.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13432-0
02:10:48.276 --> 02:10:51.636
<v Hou, Eric>So then you gonna load quite a bit of
time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13434-0
02:10:58.876 --> 02:10:59.356
<v Hou, Eric>Here we go.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13443-0
02:11:07.766 --> 02:11:10.246
<v Hou, Eric>So I just regenerate this curve.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13454-0
02:11:10.436 --> 02:11:16.116
<v Hou, Eric>Now I'm showing the class and I cut the
data for this one just from 2010.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13459-0
02:11:16.556 --> 02:11:17.276
<v Hou, Eric>Just make.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13473-0
02:11:18.076 --> 02:11:22.756
<v Hou, Eric>Just make the times is shorter.
I mean I can go back to 1920.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13477-0
02:11:22.756 --> 02:11:25.476
<v Hou, Eric>I'm just using these code space I have
only.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13485-0
02:11:27.046 --> 02:11:29.006
<v Hou, Eric>16 gigabytes of RAM.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13495-0
02:11:29.446 --> 02:11:32.203
<v Hou, Eric>There's one single model I cannot even
finish that,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13495-1
02:11:32.203 --> 02:11:34.006
<v Hou, Eric>so that's why I just cut the data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13510-0
02:11:35.726 --> 02:11:41.592
<v Hou, Eric>Here this is the one that you can do STL
analysis where an STL stand for</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13510-1
02:11:41.592 --> 02:11:42.556
<v Hou, Eric>seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13513-0
02:11:44.126 --> 02:11:44.486
<v Hou, Eric>T stand for.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13532-0
02:11:46.606 --> 02:11:52.110
<v Hou, Eric>Tran so STL analysis is really converting
this time series into trend,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13532-1
02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:54.126
<v Hou, Eric>seasonality and residuals.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13553-0
02:11:54.526 --> 02:12:01.195
<v Hou, Eric>And this is the chart I'm showing you,
but it's from 2010 to now. As you can see,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13553-1
02:12:01.195 --> 02:12:05.993
<v Hou, Eric>this is not the.
This is residual meaning noise is getting</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13553-2
02:12:05.993 --> 02:12:09.246
<v Hou, Eric>to the highest magnitude in the history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13563-0
02:12:10.996 --> 02:12:17.836
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So it's definitely the stock price.
If you zoom in getting.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13569-0
02:12:19.366 --> 02:12:20.766
<v Hou, Eric>More and more difficult to predict.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13575-0
02:12:23.396 --> 02:12:25.436
<v Hou, Eric>This one is to confirm that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13596-0
02:12:27.486 --> 02:12:35.206
<v Hou, Eric>I the time series even I called from 2010
is still a nonstationary time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13598-0
02:12:35.726 --> 02:12:37.166
<v Hou, Eric>I did differencing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13609-0
02:12:39.206 --> 02:12:42.046
<v Hou, Eric>This is after differencing I I don't like
it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13637-0
02:12:42.046 --> 02:12:47.591
<v Hou, Eric>I don't know how to use it,
it just to me it just up and down random</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13637-1
02:12:47.591 --> 02:12:52.894
<v Hou, Eric>walk and this one is to say, hey,
if there's any autocorrelation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13637-2
02:12:52.894 --> 02:12:57.876
<v Hou, Eric>So only thing that you see as stand out
are those two points.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13647-0
02:12:59.446 --> 02:13:02.246
<v Hou, Eric>One is 9 days, another one is 7 days.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13658-0
02:13:02.846 --> 02:13:06.265
<v Hou, Eric>So, considering there,
there are only 5 business days now,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13658-1
02:13:06.265 --> 02:13:07.366
<v Hou, Eric>you can do trading.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13664-0
02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:11.206
<v Hou, Eric>So that means like is this one day short
of two weeks.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13677-0
02:13:13.006 --> 02:13:18.556
<v Hou, Eric>And and and and a slightly more than one
week week of our training days.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13687-0
02:13:19.716 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Hou, Eric>I I don't know why they have, you know,
this kind of standout positive</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13687-1
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:26.476
<v Hou, Eric>correlations.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13702-0
02:13:28.046 --> 02:13:32.566
<v Hou, Eric>But it definitely look somewhat
significant compared all the other point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13711-0
02:13:32.926 --> 02:13:37.526
<v Hou, Eric>But still overall it's still very low
because here is a 25.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13718-0
02:13:37.806 --> 02:13:41.126
<v Hou, Eric>So I would say just only 10%,
but still higher than the others.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13733-0
02:13:43.716 --> 02:13:49.106
<v Hou, Eric>I I don't think there's a really
significant gonna drive us a different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13733-1
02:13:49.106 --> 02:13:51.876
<v Hou, Eric>result, but you guys can can can try.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13737-0
02:13:55.766 --> 02:13:56.486
<v Hou, Eric>Right. OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13754-0
02:13:56.486 --> 02:14:00.308
<v Hou, Eric>So this one is,
I'm just still a partition the data into</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13754-1
02:14:00.308 --> 02:14:01.246
<v Hou, Eric>training task.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13765-0
02:14:01.806 --> 02:14:06.886
<v Hou, Eric>So this is kind of training task bleed
for time series.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13768-0
02:14:07.206 --> 02:14:10.646
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot do train training task lead.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13787-0
02:14:12.286 --> 02:14:19.501
<v Hou, Eric>The way that we did for the used cars
because for time series the timing,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13787-1
02:14:19.501 --> 02:14:23.206
<v Hou, Eric>the time plays a role, so you have to.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13824-0
02:14:24.766 --> 02:14:30.172
<v Hou, Eric>Split the time series into some data as a
whole in the in the history and some data</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13824-1
02:14:30.172 --> 02:14:34.484
<v Hou, Eric>in as whole in the future,
so you wouldn't consider like 8020 roll</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13824-2
02:14:34.484 --> 02:14:39.246
<v Hou, Eric>that you randomly select sometime in the
history in the future you don't.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13828-0
02:14:39.326 --> 02:14:40.366
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot do that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13865-0
02:14:40.726 --> 02:14:45.929
<v Hou, Eric>You have to make sure that you train
based upon history data and to predict</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13865-1
02:14:45.929 --> 02:14:49.831
<v Hou, Eric>whatever back.
Then consider as a future because sitting</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13865-2
02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:53.733
<v Hou, Eric>the A A a good way to think about this is
sitting today.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13865-3
02:14:53.733 --> 02:14:57.156
<v Hou, Eric>You wouldn't see any data in the future
tomorrow.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13881-0
02:14:57.596 --> 02:15:02.964
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have to do is learning
anything happened through this very</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13881-1
02:15:02.964 --> 02:15:04.476
<v Hou, Eric>second from history.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13886-0
02:15:04.956 --> 02:15:06.396
<v Hou, Eric>That's the only thing you can do.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13929-0
02:15:06.596 --> 02:15:13.291
<v Hou, Eric>So the same thing that you should do. Uh,
following the same logic to split the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13929-1
02:15:13.291 --> 02:15:20.320
<v Hou, Eric>data into a train and test whatever train
is your you're pretending standing at the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13929-2
02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:27.516
<v Hou, Eric>moment, standing at the date of September,
the first in 2024, or or or or August the.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13943-0
02:15:27.516 --> 02:15:33.276
<v Hou, Eric>31st, 2024. You know, at that night,
you know, all the history through.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13973-0
02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:39.115
<v Hou, Eric>August the 23rd, 21st.
You're predicting the stock price after</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13973-1
02:15:39.115 --> 02:15:41.842
<v Hou, Eric>the date,
so you can you can use all the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13973-2
02:15:41.842 --> 02:15:45.366
<v Hou, Eric>information in in history and and not in
the future.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13987-0
02:15:46.486 --> 02:15:51.170
<v Hou, Eric>So that's,
that's one thing that's a different train</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13987-1
02:15:51.170 --> 02:15:54.086
<v Hou, Eric>task bleed for time series model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13992-0
02:15:55.646 --> 02:15:57.806
<v Hou, Eric>To all the other models, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/13998-0
02:15:59.486 --> 02:16:02.286
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can just quickly train.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14017-0
02:16:04.166 --> 02:16:07.772
<v Hou, Eric>Auto regressive model like this,
so I'll skip those those different models,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14017-1
02:16:07.772 --> 02:16:10.286
<v Hou, Eric>because they're gonna take a super long
time to run.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14023-0
02:16:11.286 --> 02:16:13.686
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one like ETS model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14026-0
02:16:14.006 --> 02:16:16.246
<v Hou, Eric>So then the profit model is like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14036-0
02:16:17.906 --> 02:16:20.760
<v Hou, Eric>So.
So you're gonna call the profit as a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14036-1
02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:21.386
<v Hou, Eric>function.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14051-0
02:16:23.436 --> 02:16:27.777
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna tell the model whether or not
you believe there is a daily seasonality</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14051-1
02:16:27.777 --> 02:16:28.956
<v Hou, Eric>or weekly seasonality?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14063-0
02:16:29.556 --> 02:16:32.636
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
you already seasonality and then whether</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14063-1
02:16:32.636 --> 02:16:35.716
<v Hou, Eric>or not you allow the model to
automatically?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14067-0
02:16:37.286 --> 02:16:38.806
<v Hou, Eric>Determine any changepoint.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14085-0
02:16:40.216 --> 02:16:47.010
<v Hou, Eric>The change point in terms of training,
so you provide the data I have is a daily</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14085-1
02:16:47.010 --> 02:16:48.016
<v Hou, Eric>data, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14090-0
02:16:48.016 --> 02:16:50.616
<v Hou, Eric>So then I believe I can just tell model
hey.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14102-0
02:16:52.166 --> 02:16:54.206
<v Hou, Eric>Let's assume there are some daily
seasonality.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14112-0
02:16:54.206 --> 02:16:56.814
<v Hou, Eric>Let's assume there's some weekly
seasonality,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14112-1
02:16:56.814 --> 02:16:59.366
<v Hou, Eric>yearly seasonality and then you define
this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14134-0
02:17:01.606 --> 02:17:09.000
<v Hou, Eric>This this regressor and you train based
upon the train data and then you tell the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14134-1
02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.516
<v Hou, Eric>model your definition of future, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14169-0
02:17:12.516 --> 02:17:16.265
<v Hou, Eric>So the future is whatever in the past
data and then you say hey,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14169-1
02:17:16.265 --> 02:17:20.418
<v Hou, Eric>those are the dates in the future.
At this moment you're training this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14169-2
02:17:20.418 --> 02:17:23.474
<v Hou, Eric>this model,
you tell the model what future means and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14169-3
02:17:23.474 --> 02:17:27.396
<v Hou, Eric>the model gonna predict future for you
and you can start comparing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14185-0
02:17:29.206 --> 02:17:34.679
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really bad and but you can
still see a lot of information and now</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14185-1
02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:35.926
<v Hou, Eric>you're saying hey.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14194-0
02:17:37.646 --> 02:17:40.766
<v Hou, Eric>I know my prediction looks like this.
It's not so great.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14210-0
02:17:42.366 --> 02:17:47.731
<v Hou, Eric>And I providing some information to help
this machine learning to understand</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14210-1
02:17:47.731 --> 02:17:48.846
<v Hou, Eric>what's going on.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14219-0
02:17:49.476 --> 02:17:52.876
<v Hou, Eric>So you can actually create some features,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14223-0
02:17:52.876 --> 02:17:54.356
<v Hou, Eric>So then rolling features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14227-0
02:17:54.356 --> 02:17:55.716
<v Hou, Eric>Rolling new features.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14236-0
02:17:56.156 --> 02:17:59.739
<v Hou, Eric>After doing that,
you can see these predictions get much</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14236-1
02:17:59.739 --> 02:18:01.436
<v Hou, Eric>getting much better, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14246-0
02:18:01.436 --> 02:18:06.036
<v Hou, Eric>So then at least they have the same level
and the same up and down variation.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14267-0
02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:12.726
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can see how different
features is is driving the final results.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14267-1
02:18:12.726 --> 02:18:16.486
<v Hou, Eric>You have entire report automatically
coming from profit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14285-0
02:18:19.746 --> 02:18:25.026
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I believe this profit model,
if you get familiar with you, you can.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14302-0
02:18:25.386 --> 02:18:28.647
<v Hou, Eric>You have a ton of use case in your work.
Whenever you,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14302-1
02:18:28.647 --> 02:18:32.916
<v Hou, Eric>you have the time series model.
It's always your number one time series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14302-2
02:18:32.916 --> 02:18:33.746
<v Hou, Eric>goal to model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14310-0
02:18:35.966 --> 02:18:37.206
<v Hou, Eric>That that is profit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14323-0
02:18:37.526 --> 02:18:43.626
<v Hou, Eric>I know there are some current models that
using the LLM to do the time series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14323-1
02:18:43.626 --> 02:18:44.486
<v Hou, Eric>prediction.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14361-0
02:18:46.126 --> 02:18:50.216
<v Hou, Eric>In in my real real work,
we actually tested those models that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14361-1
02:18:50.216 --> 02:18:54.042
<v Hou, Eric>called you know,
either with either use AI in their names</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14361-2
02:18:54.042 --> 02:18:57.142
<v Hou, Eric>and or a large language models in their
names,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14361-3
02:18:57.142 --> 02:19:02.287
<v Hou, Eric>and then they they redesign that kind of
algorithm to fit in this time series</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14361-4
02:19:02.287 --> 02:19:03.276
<v Hou, Eric>modeling piece.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14370-0
02:19:05.756 --> 02:19:11.316
<v Hou, Eric>What I can say from what I have observed
is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14377-0
02:19:12.886 --> 02:19:16.326
<v Hou, Eric>They're not.
They're not as good as a profit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14382-0
02:19:18.006 --> 02:19:19.086
<v Hou, Eric>Profit is still the best.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14397-0
02:19:19.686 --> 02:19:27.846
<v Hou, Eric>And then those models are prone to errors
that you have to spend long time to debug.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14414-0
02:19:28.766 --> 02:19:33.588
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you know,
I will highly recommend whenever you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14414-1
02:19:33.588 --> 02:19:38.726
<v Hou, Eric>you're seeing a time series prediction
model, just go to profit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14419-0
02:19:39.036 --> 02:19:40.676
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna save you a lot of time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14422-0
02:19:40.956 --> 02:19:43.636
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna give you really good results, OK?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14427-0
02:19:47.596 --> 02:19:50.396
<v Hou, Eric>That's for time series. Any questions?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14438-0
02:20:02.236 --> 02:20:07.596
<v Hou, Eric>So let's take a look at the second model
we're gonna cover today.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14443-0
02:20:07.876 --> 02:20:10.836
<v Hou, Eric>Is is called support vector machines OK?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14454-0
02:20:13.996 --> 02:20:18.436
<v Hou, Eric>This model is quite powerful and honestly
is quite easy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14492-0
02:20:19.156 --> 02:20:25.067
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why I I believe a 20 minute
could be good enough time to cover the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14492-1
02:20:25.067 --> 02:20:30.748
<v Hou, Eric>the the main concept of this model.
So it is a it is a supervised machine</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14492-2
02:20:30.748 --> 02:20:36.966
<v Hou, Eric>learning model and then the idea is not
hard and going to give you some examples</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14492-3
02:20:36.966 --> 02:20:37.196
<v Hou, Eric>so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14503-0
02:20:37.196 --> 02:20:41.326
<v Hou, Eric>That we we will understand the idea,
not say this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14507-0
02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:47.086
<v Hou, Eric>So then on this single line I have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14515-0
02:20:48.646 --> 02:20:49.646
<v Hou, Eric>Some blue dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14532-0
02:20:50.046 --> 02:20:58.906
<v Hou, Eric>I have those orange circles,
so then I have three options A and B and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14532-1
02:20:58.906 --> 02:20:59.286
<v Hou, Eric>CI.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14540-0
02:21:00.566 --> 02:21:05.526
<v Hou, Eric>Wanna divide those blue circles away from
the orange circles?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14546-0
02:21:07.246 --> 02:21:09.406
<v Hou, Eric>So the question to you guys is.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14561-0
02:21:10.326 --> 02:21:16.646
<v Hou, Eric>Which way is the best way to separate the
blue circles and orange circles?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14578-0
02:21:17.126 --> 02:21:25.046
<v Hou, Eric>Is that A or B or C and what? What what?
Why do you believe that is the best way?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14580-0
02:21:33.406 --> 02:21:33.966
<v Hou, Eric>Any thought?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14598-0
02:21:37.506 --> 02:21:43.445
<v Benbenek, MATT>Maybe B 'cause. It's in the middle,
it's in the middle of the the two closest</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14597-0
02:21:39.386 --> 02:21:40.466
<v Hou, Eric>Why the?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14598-1
02:21:43.445 --> 02:21:43.826
<v Benbenek, MATT>ones.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14604-0
02:21:44.896 --> 02:21:46.776
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Why? Why is B better?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14614-0
02:21:49.176 --> 02:21:53.776
<v Benbenek, MATT>It's like equidistant from the closest
blue and the closest orange.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14625-0
02:21:55.076 --> 02:21:59.716
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then I think the idea is,
let's say, if I choose.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14629-0
02:22:01.326 --> 02:22:02.116
<v Hou, Eric>A right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14642-0
02:22:02.116 --> 02:22:06.308
<v Hou, Eric>So that if I choose the way that means
line A is pretty close to the blue dots,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14642-1
02:22:06.308 --> 02:22:07.356
<v Hou, Eric>not the orange dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14656-0
02:22:08.926 --> 02:22:13.253
<v Hou, Eric>What? What? What?
Not what bad things could happen is you</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14656-1
02:22:13.253 --> 02:22:14.446
<v Hou, Eric>train this data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14660-0
02:22:14.446 --> 02:22:15.006
<v Hou, Eric>You bone.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14662-0
02:22:15.006 --> 02:22:16.846
<v Hou, Eric>You have another blue dots here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14669-0
02:22:18.526 --> 02:22:22.496
<v Hou, Eric>You're basically saying that, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14681-0
02:22:24.446 --> 02:22:29.286
<v Hou, Eric>I my model is over,
simply overemphasize those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14694-0
02:22:29.286 --> 02:22:32.766
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why I moved this super
close to this blue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14713-0
02:22:32.886 --> 02:22:39.455
<v Hou, Eric>Or just overemphasize those orange.
So then so then I have some bias either</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14713-1
02:22:39.455 --> 02:22:42.566
<v Hou, Eric>on the blue side or the orange side.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14724-0
02:22:42.566 --> 02:22:48.366
<v Hou, Eric>That's the same thing could happen if you
choose C so that however you choose B.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14745-0
02:22:49.606 --> 02:22:53.867
<v Hou, Eric>It will prevent those,
you know those surprise cases in your</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14745-1
02:22:53.867 --> 02:22:58.129
<v Hou, Eric>test data from happening.
Even if you have some doubts here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14745-2
02:22:58.129 --> 02:22:59.456
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say you have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14757-0
02:23:00.256 --> 02:23:06.121
<v Hou, Eric>You have some here in your test data.
The B going to still cover it,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14757-1
02:23:06.121 --> 02:23:08.416
<v Hou, Eric>not A and if you have some.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14774-0
02:23:11.166 --> 02:23:15.486
<v Hou, Eric>Orange in your test data and B is still
going to cover it, not C.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14786-0
02:23:16.046 --> 02:23:21.686
<v Hou, Eric>So then B will maximize the opportunity
to cover those corner cases, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14796-0
02:23:21.686 --> 02:23:28.676
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why you would like to
choose B / A or C, right? OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14800-0
02:23:28.836 --> 02:23:31.716
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see another example knowing that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14811-0
02:23:33.286 --> 02:23:37.366
<v Hou, Eric>Knowing that you have a blue dot here and
here is the orange dot.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14836-0
02:23:39.206 --> 02:23:46.720
<v Hou, Eric>Which A or B or C still want to use to
separate the majority of the blue dots</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14836-1
02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:48.646
<v Hou, Eric>and and orange dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14851-0
02:23:52.756 --> 02:24:00.436
<v Hou, Eric>Do you still choose B or you start
choosing for example A or C&amp;Y is that?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14864-0
02:24:04.236 --> 02:24:08.196
<v Teske, Benjamin>Maybe C because they're weighted more
heavily in that direction now.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14863-0
02:24:09.106 --> 02:24:10.666
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14888-0
02:24:10.786 --> 02:24:16.006
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds good. If you move to C,
You're basically saying that, OK,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14888-1
02:24:16.006 --> 02:24:21.226
<v Hou, Eric>I am actually consider this as a as a as
a legit blue dot right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14921-0
02:24:21.506 --> 02:24:25.087
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then in that case I should choose C</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14921-1
02:24:25.087 --> 02:24:31.280
<v Hou, Eric>because I I am moving towards in this the
the issue of moving using C is obviously</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14921-2
02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.906
<v Hou, Eric>in this conversation I don't.
Is there anyone gonna choose a?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14926-0
02:24:41.356 --> 02:24:42.316
<v Hou, Eric>That that's good, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14962-0
02:24:42.316 --> 02:24:45.486
<v Hou, Eric>So then the real competition is between
B&amp;</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14962-1
02:24:45.486 --> 02:24:49.802
<v Hou, Eric>C because you want to say whether or not
I consider this, this,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14962-2
02:24:49.802 --> 02:24:53.443
<v Hou, Eric>this blue dots as a legit.
The only thing I will say,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14962-3
02:24:53.443 --> 02:24:58.636
<v Hou, Eric>I will argue the still better case is B
is maybe in this training data that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14969-0
02:24:58.636 --> 02:24:59.356
<v Hou, Eric>Is blue dot.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14975-0
02:24:59.356 --> 02:25:01.916
<v Hou, Eric>Is is anomaly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/14977-0
02:25:02.356 --> 02:25:03.676
<v Hou, Eric>So if that's the case.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15000-0
02:25:05.246 --> 02:25:07.932
<v Hou, Eric>You're moving toward more to those orange
dots,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15000-1
02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:11.792
<v Hou, Eric>and you're you're you're you're having
the issue with the test data,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15000-2
02:25:11.792 --> 02:25:14.366
<v Hou, Eric>that orange being somewhere between B&amp;
C.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15028-0
02:25:15.686 --> 02:25:19.949
<v Hou, Eric>However,
B still block still maximize the way of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15028-1
02:25:19.949 --> 02:25:23.952
<v Hou, Eric>providing those surprise have from
happening.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15028-2
02:25:23.952 --> 02:25:27.606
<v Hou, Eric>Considering the majority of the blue dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15061-0
02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:32.411
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will still say the better case
is still B,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15061-1
02:25:32.411 --> 02:25:37.669
<v Hou, Eric>but the assumption of choosing B is I'm
the I'm designing an algorithm</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15061-2
02:25:37.669 --> 02:25:43.446
<v Hou, Eric>considering if this is only one dot over
there, I will consider that anomaly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15065-0
02:25:44.286 --> 02:25:45.766
<v Hou, Eric>But if you do see.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15072-0
02:25:47.326 --> 02:25:49.166
<v Hou, Eric>A significant portion of Blue Dolson here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15081-0
02:25:50.886 --> 02:25:52.446
<v Hou, Eric>And then maybe you should choose C.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15087-0
02:25:52.446 --> 02:25:56.886
<v Hou, Eric>But just knowing this one dot here and
then six dot here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15098-0
02:25:58.606 --> 02:26:01.206
<v Hou, Eric>I I sort of can consider this as a
nominee.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15105-0
02:26:01.326 --> 02:26:03.086
<v Hou, Eric>So I I can choose B.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15129-0
02:26:03.086 --> 02:26:07.123
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll say it depend on what you believe
in, but definitely not a.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15129-1
02:26:07.123 --> 02:26:10.566
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can choose B and you can
choose C choosing B.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15137-0
02:26:10.566 --> 02:26:12.806
<v Hou, Eric>You consider this is an nominee choosing
C.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15139-0
02:26:12.846 --> 02:26:14.166
<v Hou, Eric>You consider this is legit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15149-0
02:26:15.846 --> 02:26:19.996
<v Hou, Eric>The issue of choosing C is if you know
it's another color.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15152-0
02:26:21.566 --> 02:26:22.086
<v Hou, Eric>Argument, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15165-0
02:26:22.086 --> 02:26:26.126
<v Hou, Eric>So if it does anomaly analysis,
you do have some orange dots here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15172-0
02:26:26.246 --> 02:26:30.246
<v Hou, Eric>So then the C may cause some overfeeding.
OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15176-0
02:26:30.246 --> 02:26:31.406
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the reason.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15194-0
02:26:30.916 --> 02:26:35.590
<v Teske, Benjamin>So it doesn't matter if you have like 100
orange dots and six blue dots like</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15194-1
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:37.836
<v Teske, Benjamin>there's still two separate data sets.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15198-0
02:26:37.836 --> 02:26:38.876
<v Teske, Benjamin>You wanna keep them separate?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15206-0
02:26:41.156 --> 02:26:43.676
<v Hou, Eric>So say you have 100 blue orange dial.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15211-0
02:26:43.676 --> 02:26:45.956
<v Hou, Eric>You have only 6 blue dots here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15218-0
02:26:47.526 --> 02:26:49.006
<v Hou, Eric>You still have one.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15229-0
02:26:49.046 --> 02:26:54.486
<v Hou, Eric>You still have one orange dot that is
close to this blue dot right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15241-0
02:26:56.126 --> 02:26:58.324
<v Hou, Eric>You, you,
you eventually gonna have one or or two</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15241-1
02:26:58.324 --> 02:27:00.126
<v Hou, Eric>if they are. They have the same position.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15247-0
02:27:05.066 --> 02:27:06.146
<v Hou, Eric>So so sorry.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15248-0
02:27:06.146 --> 02:27:06.826
<v Hou, Eric>You you have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15257-0
02:27:06.826 --> 02:27:09.697
<v Hou, Eric>You.
You're saying there have 100 orange dots?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15257-1
02:27:09.697 --> 02:27:10.186
<v Hou, Eric>So what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15269-0
02:27:11.066 --> 02:27:11.946
<v Hou, Eric>What's your suggestion?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15281-0
02:27:11.076 --> 02:27:15.148
<v Teske, Benjamin>Like the the size of or like the,
the distribution between the two doesn't</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15281-1
02:27:15.148 --> 02:27:17.916
<v Teske, Benjamin>matter as long as you're picking the
center point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15282-0
02:27:17.916 --> 02:27:18.796
<v Teske, Benjamin>Is that what you're saying?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15312-0
02:27:21.656 --> 02:27:25.662
<v Hou, Eric>It doesn't matter the distribution of the
orange, it does matter.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15312-1
02:27:25.662 --> 02:27:30.395
<v Hou, Eric>The distribution of the blue because it
is really sort of a blue entering the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15312-2
02:27:30.395 --> 02:27:33.976
<v Hou, Eric>territory of the orange,
not the orange going to the blue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15319-0
02:27:33.976 --> 02:27:36.096
<v Hou, Eric>Well, you can argue it's only one here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15327-0
02:27:37.026 --> 02:27:38.546
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yeah, I got. I get it. Yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15324-0
02:27:37.926 --> 02:27:38.366
<v Hou, Eric>Right, right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15331-0
02:27:38.366 --> 02:27:39.566
<v Hou, Eric>So that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15341-0
02:27:39.606 --> 02:27:41.866
<v Hou, Eric>So if you believe there's one orange in
blue,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15341-1
02:27:41.866 --> 02:27:44.126
<v Hou, Eric>so you you really need to put this down
here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15346-0
02:27:48.226 --> 02:27:49.026
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, you're right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15368-0
02:27:49.106 --> 02:27:53.732
<v Hou, Eric>You're right.
If you do have 100 orange dots and then</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15368-1
02:27:53.732 --> 02:27:59.986
<v Hou, Eric>you have more confidence to say this is
an this very orange and anomaly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15382-0
02:28:01.526 --> 02:28:04.961
<v Hou, Eric>Not this very blue.
An anomaly from the blue group,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15382-1
02:28:04.961 --> 02:28:07.206
<v Hou, Eric>so that you should put a bar here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15385-0
02:28:13.046 --> 02:28:15.046
<v Hou, Eric>Because because.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15394-0
02:28:16.606 --> 02:28:18.966
<v Hou, Eric>See if you have a majority of the orange
here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15401-0
02:28:20.716 --> 02:28:23.196
<v Hou, Eric>You know, you never just, you know,
I'm just copy pasting, you know.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15408-0
02:28:24.766 --> 02:28:27.566
<v Hou, Eric>Here you sort of know that those are.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15413-0
02:28:29.206 --> 02:28:30.726
<v Hou, Eric>Where our resign.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15417-0
02:28:32.286 --> 02:28:32.926
<v Hou, Eric>This one is anomaly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15428-0
02:28:34.686 --> 02:28:39.286
<v Hou, Eric>I have only 7 blue so that I will
consider those seven are legit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15436-0
02:28:39.766 --> 02:28:42.286
<v Hou, Eric>So it's it's definitely more,
it's definitely.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15453-0
02:28:43.926 --> 02:28:48.166
<v Hou, Eric>More probable,
it's definitely higher probability to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15453-1
02:28:48.166 --> 02:28:51.846
<v Hou, Eric>consider.
This is not anomaly than this is an</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15453-2
02:28:51.846 --> 02:28:52.486
<v Hou, Eric>anomaly.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15475-0
02:28:52.956 --> 02:28:56.898
<v Hou, Eric>This is because you have 99 here and only
one here,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15475-1
02:28:56.898 --> 02:29:00.916
<v Hou, Eric>so highly likely this is anomaly and this
is not so.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15494-0
02:29:00.916 --> 02:29:07.093
<v Hou, Eric>Then you make sure you may want to put
this bar here to block this and this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15494-1
02:29:07.093 --> 02:29:11.076
<v Hou, Eric>because you're you're blocking 99 of the
orange.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15515-0
02:29:12.646 --> 02:29:17.796
<v Hou, Eric>And then this is only one anomaly you're
ignoring that could maximize your, your,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15515-1
02:29:17.796 --> 02:29:18.926
<v Hou, Eric>your your benefit.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15518-0
02:29:20.646 --> 02:29:21.286
<v Hou, Eric>Does it make sense?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15521-0
02:29:24.026 --> 02:29:24.626
<v Teske, Benjamin>Makes sense?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15523-0
02:29:25.176 --> 02:29:25.976
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15537-0
02:29:28.266 --> 02:29:36.078
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah,
so one is you one way of putting bars is</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15537-1
02:29:36.078 --> 02:29:37.796
<v Hou, Eric>you do not.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15552-0
02:29:38.076 --> 02:29:45.196
<v Hou, Eric>You do not allow any part of the other
group entering your sort of territory.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15558-0
02:29:45.596 --> 02:29:47.356
<v Hou, Eric>For example, you are putting a bar here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15561-0
02:29:47.396 --> 02:29:49.316
<v Hou, Eric>No one org.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15565-0
02:29:49.316 --> 02:29:52.156
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot enter blue territory in blue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15571-0
02:29:52.156 --> 02:29:53.636
<v Hou, Eric>Hey, you cannot go across the bar.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15577-0
02:29:53.636 --> 02:29:55.596
<v Hou, Eric>It's sort of like a border of a two
countries.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15601-0
02:29:56.446 --> 02:30:02.537
<v Hou, Eric>And and this way is so hey, I have a bar,
the majority of you guys don't come here</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15601-1
02:30:02.537 --> 02:30:05.326
<v Hou, Eric>and then we're not coming here either.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15618-0
02:30:05.326 --> 02:30:09.291
<v Hou, Eric>So then or the majority of blue don't
come here for example,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15618-1
02:30:09.291 --> 02:30:13.126
<v Hou, Eric>like I have a lot of I have say I have a
lot of blue here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15620-0
02:30:15.126 --> 02:30:15.566
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15625-0
02:30:17.206 --> 02:30:18.726
<v Hou, Eric>I have only one blue here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15668-0
02:30:20.446 --> 02:30:23.361
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
I'm still maybe wanna put a bar here so</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15668-1
02:30:23.361 --> 02:30:28.395
<v Hou, Eric>that I'm I have only some exceptions
coming into my territory and some from</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15668-2
02:30:28.395 --> 02:30:32.304
<v Hou, Eric>your group coming here,
but still this bar can a block the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15668-3
02:30:32.304 --> 02:30:34.556
<v Hou, Eric>majority of those, that's also OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15669-0
02:30:34.556 --> 02:30:35.796
<v Hou, Eric>I'm achieving my goal.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15675-0
02:30:35.876 --> 02:30:38.756
<v Hou, Eric>I can sort of identify this part.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15687-0
02:30:40.326 --> 02:30:43.766
<v Hou, Eric>It's 99% of blue and this part is 99%
orange.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15708-0
02:30:44.406 --> 02:30:47.945
<v Hou, Eric>So the difference of that is,
is is a concept, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15708-1
02:30:47.945 --> 02:30:51.206
<v Hou, Eric>And then also language is to to the 2D,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15712-0
02:30:51.886 --> 02:30:52.806
<v Hou, Eric>So we know that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15717-0
02:30:52.806 --> 02:30:54.966
<v Hou, Eric>And then let's say in the 2D we have.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15729-0
02:30:56.646 --> 02:30:58.770
<v Hou, Eric>The R,
the black dots and then we have white</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15729-1
02:30:58.770 --> 02:30:59.006
<v Hou, Eric>dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15745-0
02:30:59.846 --> 02:31:06.213
<v Hou, Eric>There are three ways that we can sort of
set a bar or set a boundary of the black</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15745-1
02:31:06.213 --> 02:31:07.766
<v Hou, Eric>dots and white dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15753-0
02:31:08.196 --> 02:31:09.716
<v Hou, Eric>Which one do you consider is a?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15761-0
02:31:09.876 --> 02:31:13.946
<v Hou, Eric>Is is a better,
better boundary of those two groups of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15761-1
02:31:13.946 --> 02:31:14.316
<v Hou, Eric>dots?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15775-0
02:31:27.596 --> 02:31:32.236
<v Hou, Eric>Is there anyone believe that H1 is a
better way to separate black dots and</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15775-1
02:31:32.236 --> 02:31:32.916
<v Hou, Eric>white dots?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15782-0
02:31:38.146 --> 02:31:38.626
<v Benbenek, MATT>No.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15783-0
02:31:39.306 --> 02:31:41.706
<v Hou, Eric>No, of course, right,
because you did a separate.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15790-0
02:31:43.246 --> 02:31:44.286
<v Hou, Eric>H2 did right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15797-0
02:31:44.806 --> 02:31:48.926
<v Hou, Eric>H2 did separate the black dots and white
dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15801-0
02:31:50.646 --> 02:31:51.366
<v Hou, Eric>So did.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15803-0
02:31:51.446 --> 02:31:53.126
<v Hou, Eric>So does H3.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15818-0
02:31:54.726 --> 02:32:02.997
<v Hou, Eric>The only difference is the the the black
dot closest to this H3 has distance</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15818-1
02:32:02.997 --> 02:32:04.286
<v Hou, Eric>longer than.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15831-0
02:32:05.846 --> 02:32:10.566
<v Hou, Eric>Not black dot closer to H2.
So then this distance is longer than that.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15854-0
02:32:12.286 --> 02:32:15.942
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
Although it's kind of a symmetry between</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15854-1
02:32:15.942 --> 02:32:21.121
<v Hou, Eric>this black and white dots,
either you know both H2 and NH3 type dot</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15854-2
02:32:21.121 --> 02:32:21.806
<v Hou, Eric>symmetry.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15896-0
02:32:23.486 --> 02:32:30.074
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning the distance between this black
and this H2 is the same as this H2 to</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15896-1
02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:36.408
<v Hou, Eric>this closest Y dot they have the same
distance and this black which is the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15896-2
02:32:36.408 --> 02:32:41.307
<v Hou, Eric>closest dot to H3,
has the same distance to this distance</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15896-3
02:32:41.307 --> 02:32:42.996
<v Hou, Eric>between this H3 and.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15901-0
02:32:42.996 --> 02:32:44.316
<v Hou, Eric>This closest white dot.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15926-0
02:32:45.886 --> 02:32:53.940
<v Hou, Eric>So which one out of you know H2 and H3 do
you consider is the best way to separate</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15926-1
02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:56.366
<v Hou, Eric>this black and and white?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15928-0
02:32:57.196 --> 02:32:57.756
<v Hou, Eric>Dot.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15930-0
02:33:07.036 --> 02:33:07.556
<v Teske, Benjamin>H3.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15934-0
02:33:09.116 --> 02:33:10.276
<v Hou, Eric>Is why is H3.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15939-0
02:33:11.046 --> 02:33:12.566
<v Teske, Benjamin>So if you look at the entire.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15947-0
02:33:14.166 --> 02:33:16.246
<v Teske, Benjamin>Distribution of the dots, it's the better.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15953-0
02:33:18.006 --> 02:33:19.286
<v Teske, Benjamin>Segmentation between the two of them.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15958-0
02:33:20.106 --> 02:33:21.026
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15973-0
02:33:21.226 --> 02:33:24.514
<v Hou, Eric>Or you can say, hey,
let's say if if you were only focused on</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15973-1
02:33:24.514 --> 02:33:25.946
<v Hou, Eric>this first quadrant, right.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15989-0
02:33:25.946 --> 02:33:31.408
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we are we're giving this ay
dots much bigger space than we are giving</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15989-1
02:33:31.408 --> 02:33:33.026
<v Hou, Eric>these black dots, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/15992-0
02:33:33.026 --> 02:33:34.426
<v Hou, Eric>We're giving black dots here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16001-0
02:33:35.966 --> 02:33:39.086
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just add a shape.
We're giving this black dots here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16008-0
02:33:44.486 --> 02:33:47.366
<v Hou, Eric>Shapes if we are using H2, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16017-0
02:33:47.366 --> 02:33:51.696
<v Hou, Eric>So then we are giving the Y dots all
those places, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16047-0
02:33:51.976 --> 02:33:57.386
<v Hou, Eric>So there's much more and much bigger
place we gave to to the black dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16047-1
02:33:57.386 --> 02:34:01.165
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if we use H3 entire up our black going up</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16047-2
02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:03.536
<v Hou, Eric>the entire distraction are wide.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16063-0
02:34:03.896 --> 02:34:09.098
<v Hou, Eric>So we're sort of like evenly separate
entire first quadrant into half,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16063-1
02:34:09.098 --> 02:34:11.296
<v Hou, Eric>1/2 is black and 1/2 is white.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16066-0
02:34:11.296 --> 02:34:12.816
<v Hou, Eric>So then problem done.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16080-0
02:34:13.296 --> 02:34:17.509
<v Hou, Eric>So this is more fair separation between
this this group of black dots and this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16080-1
02:34:17.509 --> 02:34:18.576
<v Hou, Eric>group of white dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16106-0
02:34:19.486 --> 02:34:23.768
<v Hou, Eric>And and and the way of quantifying that
is the distance between between the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16106-1
02:34:23.768 --> 02:34:28.276
<v Hou, Eric>closest black dot to that boundary and
then the closest Y dot to that boundary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16141-0
02:34:28.276 --> 02:34:32.150
<v Hou, Eric>So then this distance is definitely
bigger than this distance,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16141-1
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:36.271
<v Hou, Eric>then that deep distance telling us, OK,
we need to find, you know,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16141-2
02:34:36.271 --> 02:34:41.191
<v Hou, Eric>maybe maximize of this distance and that
boundary gonna be the boundary that we</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16141-3
02:34:41.191 --> 02:34:42.236
<v Hou, Eric>were looking for.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16165-0
02:34:43.676 --> 02:34:47.035
<v Hou, Eric>Similar situation.
Let's say if we have this black dot</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16165-1
02:34:47.035 --> 02:34:51.065
<v Hou, Eric>coming in this direction,
this black dot the black dots come this</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16165-2
02:34:51.065 --> 02:34:55.156
<v Hou, Eric>black dot coming into this territory.
Do we still want to keep H3?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16168-0
02:35:01.446 --> 02:35:01.926
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16169-0
02:35:02.966 --> 02:35:03.406
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16172-0
02:35:04.486 --> 02:35:04.526
<v Benbenek, MATT>I.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16198-0
02:35:04.526 --> 02:35:07.613
<v Benbenek, MATT>I don't like. Yeah,
I don't think there's a way you can</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16181-0
02:35:04.966 --> 02:35:06.166
<v Hou, Eric>Because we're yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16198-1
02:35:07.613 --> 02:35:11.526
<v Benbenek, MATT>separate it to get rid of the anomalies
there and still keep the rest.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16192-0
02:35:10.306 --> 02:35:10.666
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16199-0
02:35:12.206 --> 02:35:13.926
<v Hou, Eric>Right. I agree with you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16226-0
02:35:13.926 --> 02:35:17.865
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're sort of saying, hey,
before we have those two guys,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16226-1
02:35:17.865 --> 02:35:22.332
<v Hou, Eric>we sort of have like a soft boundary here
and we have a soft boundary here.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16226-2
02:35:22.332 --> 02:35:24.566
<v Hou, Eric>And then those are the buffers, right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16235-0
02:35:24.566 --> 02:35:28.030
<v Hou, Eric>Nobody coming here and then boom,
this is my country line,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16235-1
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:29.086
<v Hou, Eric>don't come across.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16253-0
02:35:30.806 --> 02:35:33.519
<v Hou, Eric>But you know,
in case there's someone that come across,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16253-1
02:35:33.519 --> 02:35:35.166
<v Hou, Eric>we have to say, OK, you know what?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16258-0
02:35:35.166 --> 02:35:36.486
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's the spy.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16259-0
02:35:36.926 --> 02:35:38.726
<v Hou, Eric>So actually.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16276-0
02:35:40.366 --> 02:35:45.624
<v Hou, Eric>Align those kind of lines.
If you do have you have X1 you have X2,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16276-1
02:35:45.624 --> 02:35:46.566
<v Hou, Eric>you have X3.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16279-0
02:35:47.046 --> 02:35:48.246
<v Hou, Eric>Just want to make the point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16287-0
02:35:49.966 --> 02:35:52.116
<v Hou, Eric>This line is actually a plane like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16299-0
02:35:52.116 --> 02:35:57.716
<v Hou, Eric>It's sort of like how you visualize those
chart into a a 3D World.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16310-0
02:35:59.766 --> 02:36:04.286
<v Hou, Eric>So I I I think I'm not going to talk
about this. Let's.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16319-0
02:36:06.286 --> 02:36:09.126
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's why, you know,
even you have a OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16321-0
02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:10.686
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just copy those two points.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16368-0
02:36:13.436 --> 02:36:19.508
<v Hou, Eric>To here, so those two points here,
they're sort of like within our buffer</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16368-1
02:36:19.508 --> 02:36:25.907
<v Hou, Eric>area, but still we can keep this as,
as as a country line so that we keep the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16368-2
02:36:25.907 --> 02:36:31.979
<v Hou, Eric>majority of this wide and black dots from
entering different territories.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16368-3
02:36:31.979 --> 02:36:34.276
<v Hou, Eric>So we can still keep like a.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16384-0
02:36:34.276 --> 02:36:38.806
<v Hou, Eric>Relative peace between this group and
this group and then H3 is sort of the</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16384-1
02:36:38.806 --> 02:36:40.236
<v Hou, Eric>sort of a good boundary.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16403-0
02:36:41.046 --> 02:36:43.579
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if you do see a lot of either black or</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16403-1
02:36:43.579 --> 02:36:47.800
<v Hou, Eric>white coming to this this this territory,
so then this after it should not hold</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16403-2
02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:48.116
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16416-0
02:36:48.556 --> 02:36:55.036
<v Hou, Eric>So then the the SVM idea is coming from
this separate. It's super simple way of.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16419-0
02:36:56.606 --> 02:36:57.806
<v Hou, Eric>Separating dots.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16432-0
02:36:59.486 --> 02:37:02.606
<v Hou, Eric>What one thing I will say, you know,
why is SVM?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16437-0
02:37:03.206 --> 02:37:07.206
<v Hou, Eric>The support vector margin is so cool.
Is the following.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16440-0
02:37:07.206 --> 02:37:07.806
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16449-0
02:37:10.076 --> 02:37:15.396
<v Hou, Eric>So say you 2 have you know the two groups
are like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16460-0
02:37:16.916 --> 02:37:21.836
<v Hou, Eric>You know from a human being perspective,
you can definitely tell those are blue.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16471-0
02:37:21.836 --> 02:37:24.796
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely tell those are cross
and and red.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16475-0
02:37:24.996 --> 02:37:26.396
<v Hou, Eric>You can separate those.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16502-0
02:37:26.876 --> 02:37:34.109
<v Hou, Eric>How you gonna divide this entire plane to
have the machine to separate this plane</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16502-1
02:37:34.109 --> 02:37:40.636
<v Hou, Eric>by by identifying the difference between
the blue dots and the Red Cross.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16503-0
02:37:40.636 --> 02:37:42.436
<v Hou, Eric>By separating this plane.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16522-0
02:37:43.246 --> 02:37:50.508
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know from our linear logistic
regression what we can do is only set a</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16522-1
02:37:50.508 --> 02:37:53.076
<v Hou, Eric>line to separate those which.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16547-0
02:37:54.646 --> 02:37:59.364
<v Hou, Eric>Doesn't work because a big portion of
this blue dots gonna come into this area</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16547-1
02:37:59.364 --> 02:38:03.366
<v Hou, Eric>and big portion of this Red Cross is
gonna come to this blue area.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16550-0
02:38:03.606 --> 02:38:05.766
<v Hou, Eric>So then we misclassify.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16569-0
02:38:07.406 --> 02:38:11.432
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of those points,
just knowing they are not linear so that</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16569-1
02:38:11.432 --> 02:38:15.646
<v Hou, Eric>you cannot really use a linear model on
top of the nonlinear data.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16575-0
02:38:16.516 --> 02:38:17.236
<v Hou, Eric>That's the point.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16582-0
02:38:17.516 --> 02:38:24.276
<v Hou, Eric>But with this SVM we start having a
separation like this.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16586-0
02:38:24.956 --> 02:38:26.236
<v Hou, Eric>So this is beautiful.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16596-0
02:38:26.236 --> 02:38:31.116
<v Hou, Eric>It's a close to a human's way of telling
the differences.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16622-0
02:38:31.116 --> 02:38:36.014
<v Hou, Eric>So now you're going to start having
curves that within the.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16622-1
02:38:36.014 --> 02:38:42.709
<v Hou, Eric>Within this this 2D dimensions and this
those curves are automatically learned by</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16622-2
02:38:42.709 --> 02:38:45.076
<v Hou, Eric>those machine learning model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16634-0
02:38:45.356 --> 02:38:51.156
<v Hou, Eric>So this is not your telling the model to
draw those curves, it draw itself.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16663-0
02:38:51.916 --> 02:38:57.430
<v Hou, Eric>So they can be have this curve,
it can be having this curve different</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16663-1
02:38:57.430 --> 02:39:04.046
<v Hou, Eric>ways that the model Start learning how to
separate those blue and and and Red Cross</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16663-2
02:39:04.046 --> 02:39:04.676
<v Hou, Eric>crosses.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16666-0
02:39:04.956 --> 02:39:07.116
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really cool.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16708-0
02:39:08.686 --> 02:39:14.632
<v Hou, Eric>Idea of using SVM so that you can start
handling some really tricky data like</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16708-1
02:39:14.632 --> 02:39:20.579
<v Hou, Eric>this that you were never able to handle
using any linear model in tree model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16708-2
02:39:20.579 --> 02:39:25.915
<v Hou, Eric>You may be able to do that,
but in case you only have an X coordinate</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16708-3
02:39:25.915 --> 02:39:27.516
<v Hou, Eric>and Y coordinates as.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16723-0
02:39:27.516 --> 02:39:29.988
<v Hou, Eric>An input the tree model cannot help you
either,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16723-1
02:39:29.988 --> 02:39:31.996
<v Hou, Eric>because there's too little information.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16747-0
02:39:31.996 --> 02:39:35.839
<v Hou, Eric>Remember from now the used car pricing
sample,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16747-1
02:39:35.839 --> 02:39:42.053
<v Hou, Eric>if we only provide the the modeling
information to predict the the the used</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16747-2
02:39:42.053 --> 02:39:44.996
<v Hou, Eric>car price, the accuracy is terrible.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16753-0
02:39:46.566 --> 02:39:47.446
<v Hou, Eric>It's just simply terrible.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16764-0
02:39:47.446 --> 02:39:50.766
<v Hou, Eric>You need to provide more and more
information to that tree model.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16767-0
02:39:50.766 --> 02:39:51.846
<v Hou, Eric>It can learn it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16782-0
02:39:51.926 --> 02:39:54.558
<v Hou, Eric>It can make the accuracy much,
much better,</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16782-1
02:39:54.558 --> 02:39:58.806
<v Hou, Eric>but in here you want to separate those
two groups. You have only an X.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16786-0
02:39:58.966 --> 02:39:59.966
<v Hou, Eric>You have only ay.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16802-0
02:40:00.246 --> 02:40:04.372
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have all the other information
to the model to the machine.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16802-1
02:40:04.372 --> 02:40:07.436
<v Hou, Eric>Learning blue and red does not make any
difference.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16805-0
02:40:07.436 --> 02:40:08.636
<v Hou, Eric>You you can blind it.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16823-0
02:40:08.916 --> 02:40:12.492
<v Hou, Eric>It does not make any difference for them,
so that eventually they can learn to draw</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16823-1
02:40:12.492 --> 02:40:13.556
<v Hou, Eric>a curve to separate them.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16825-0
02:40:13.556 --> 02:40:14.516
<v Hou, Eric>That's very impressive.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16833-0
02:40:16.086 --> 02:40:19.166
<v Hou, Eric>So from this SVM we started seeing.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16851-0
02:40:20.766 --> 02:40:25.364
<v Hou, Eric>This learning happening from our models
and then for neural network these kind of</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16851-1
02:40:25.364 --> 02:40:27.606
<v Hou, Eric>thing going to happen quite quite often.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16870-0
02:40:27.766 --> 02:40:33.569
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why this model we are training
those model is getting closer and closer</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16870-1
02:40:33.569 --> 02:40:35.196
<v Hou, Eric>to to human beings, OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16873-0
02:40:35.476 --> 02:40:37.556
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's preview for next time.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16884-0
02:40:39.126 --> 02:40:41.366
<v Hou, Eric>Enjoy next week to confirm you guys,
right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16888-0
02:40:41.486 --> 02:40:42.326
<v Hou, Eric>I checked the calendar.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16891-0
02:40:42.326 --> 02:40:44.486
<v Hou, Eric>Next week is the spring break right?</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16898-0
02:40:49.346 --> 02:40:49.786
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16895-0
02:40:50.316 --> 02:40:50.756
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16902-0
02:40:50.756 --> 02:40:51.996
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect. OK.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16909-0
02:40:51.996 --> 02:40:54.236
<v Hou, Eric>I'll say you guys enjoy your spring break.</v>

<v Hou, Eric>I'll. I'll see you.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16916-0
02:40:55.396 --> 02:40:56.756
<v Hou, Eric>So no class next week.</v>

45eacdd2-72bb-45a7-b55a-f00ade208ccc/16919-0
02:40:57.036 --> 02:40:58.556
