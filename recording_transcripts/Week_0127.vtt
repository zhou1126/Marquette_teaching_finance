157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/27-0
00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:04.503
<v Hou, Eric>Oh yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/29-0
00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:09.083
<v Hou, Eric>There we go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/33-0
00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:11.343
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/37-0
00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:13.533
<v Hou, Eric>So last time we were talking about here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/44-0
00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:17.503
<v Hou, Eric>We've talked about the Cam, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/53-0
00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:20.063
<v Hou, Eric>So the the Cam model, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/57-0
00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.423
<v Hou, Eric>So it's fundamental financial theory.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/63-0
00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:23.903
<v Hou, Eric>I believe you guys know it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/73-0
00:00:23.903 --> 00:00:29.423
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really measuring the access
return of individual stock versus.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/80-0
00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.383
<v Hou, Eric>The market access return right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/87-0
00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:35.183
<v Hou, Eric>So then that is what this is talking
about.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/98-0
00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:41.503
<v Hou, Eric>So this this is the one individual stock
access return over the risk free rate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/111-0
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:48.676
<v Hou, Eric>Versus the entire market risk entire
market access return over the risk for</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/111-1
00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:49.093
<v Hou, Eric>rate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/133-0
00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:52.286
<v Hou, Eric>So then the the coefficient,
we call it beta,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/133-1
00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:57.095
<v Hou, Eric>and then the beta is measuring the
sensitivity of that stock return over the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/133-2
00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.093
<v Hou, Eric>market access return, right, so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/153-0
00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:03.895
<v Hou, Eric>Last time we talked about, you know,
the linear models and we talked about,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/153-1
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.383
<v Hou, Eric>you know, how the beta is assessed.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/165-0
00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:10.663
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just show you some example like
how we can actually measure the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/170-0
00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:12.393
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/177-0
00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:16.263
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just larger this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/178-0
00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:18.463
<v Hou, Eric>So sorry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/192-0
00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:23.863
<v Hou, Eric>So so this one I was just talking about
this code right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/208-0
00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Hou, Eric>This is Python code and then you'll be
using those sample codes to do your</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/208-1
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.023
<v Hou, Eric>homework.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/232-0
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:35.327
<v Hou, Eric>So this piece is is you gonna import some
necessary libraries in in your Jupiter</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/232-1
00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:40.939
<v Hou, Eric>notebook by the way, as you can see,
I call it Jupiter notebook just because</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/232-2
00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:41.303
<v Hou, Eric>it's.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/243-0
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.813
<v Hou, Eric>Called ipymb.
So this is a Jupiter notebook.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/247-0
00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:47.023
<v Hou, Eric>File names.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/256-0
00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:52.823
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm really importing libraries.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/267-0
00:01:53.023 --> 00:02:00.183
<v Hou, Eric>This is why finance and I said import.
Why finance as yf. So what is why finance?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/282-0
00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:08.933
<v Hou, Eric>So this is something that you can
definitely find a Google.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/292-0
00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:15.813
<v Hou, Eric>So why finance is is a Yahoo Finance API.
It's free to use.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/322-0
00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:21.508
<v Hou, Eric>You can download whatever data you want
as long as you just provide the ticker</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/322-1
00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.337
<v Hou, Eric>and you provide the time to start time
end time. So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/322-2
00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:29.693
<v Hou, Eric>So for example I specify the start date
and specify the end date.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/329-0
00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:33.903
<v Hou, Eric>I give that some equity T curves to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/341-0
00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.493
<v Hou, Eric>To this code and then you can actually
download data for you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/350-0
00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.933
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really API is really
convenient and it's free.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/355-0
00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.893
<v Hou, Eric>You don't have to pay anything, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/358-0
00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:43.653
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/363-0
00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.133
<v Hou, Eric>You can download the financial data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/378-0
00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:51.103
<v Hou, Eric>And also this one pandas pandas is a
really useful data frame.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/410-0
00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:57.181
<v Hou, Eric>Data frame package that you use in Python
or in Jbar notebook so that you can you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/410-1
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:02.096
<v Hou, Eric>have a lot of built in functions to help
you to do a lot of aggregation and and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/410-2
00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.263
<v Hou, Eric>the data migration.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/415-0
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:04.333
<v Hou, Eric>Data migration.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/422-0
00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.813
<v Hou, Eric>Data merging, data filtration.
Those kind of work.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/461-0
00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:12.492
<v Hou, Eric>So it's really helpful and nonpi is is
another library if you consider you have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/461-1
00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.963
<v Hou, Eric>a you have a string,
you have a vector of numbers and Numpy is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/461-2
00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:22.215
<v Hou, Eric>something that really help you to to
manage that vector of data and quite</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/461-3
00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:25.693
<v Hou, Eric>efficient compared to pandas because
pandas you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/474-0
00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:29.613
<v Hou, Eric>Consider this really a table is a matrix,
but nonhy is really dealing with a vector.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/489-0
00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Hou, Eric>Right,
so this is a really managing the time and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/489-1
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.963
<v Hou, Eric>this is the key piece that you gonna run
some model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/497-0
00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:38.363
<v Hou, Eric>So this is like a stack models API.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/504-0
00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:39.923
<v Hou, Eric>So then you call it SM.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/519-0
00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:46.471
<v Hou, Eric>This one gonna give you the poor that you
can run linear regression models or any</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/519-1
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:48.883
<v Hou, Eric>models or or any other models, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/535-0
00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:53.876
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just use this stat model to
run a linear regression model in.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/535-1
00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:55.243
<v Hou, Eric>In this example, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/543-0
00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:57.103
<v Hou, Eric>So quite easy you can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/547-0
00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.623
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely you can definitely find any.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/572-0
00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:06.444
<v Hou, Eric>User manual online, but you know,
as long as you code more is a really you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/572-1
00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:10.613
<v Hou, Eric>You can basically use the code and change
the parameters right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/598-0
00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:15.968
<v Hou, Eric>So then what I did is I specified start
time start date that is 2010 January.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/598-1
00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:20.293
<v Hou, Eric>The first I specify the end date there's
a 2024 December 31st.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/612-0
00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:25.383
<v Hou, Eric>I I will download the risk free ticker
and this this one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/626-0
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:29.572
<v Hou, Eric>So this is 13 week treasury yield.
So that I will gonna use it as a risk</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/626-1
00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:31.063
<v Hou, Eric>free ticker risk for rate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/637-0
00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:34.143
<v Hou, Eric>And then the market index is a GSPC.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/656-0
00:04:34.143 --> 00:04:41.086
<v Hou, Eric>So this is like SSP 500 index and you can
verify this. You can copy this ticker,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/656-1
00:04:41.086 --> 00:04:43.743
<v Hou, Eric>go to Google and search for it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/682-0
00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:48.651
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite easy and then you can find a
Yahoo finance is an ISP 500 and it</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/682-1
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:51.663
<v Hou, Eric>showing you here and then it's very
convenient.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/691-0
00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:57.223
<v Hou, Eric>You can have all number of years and
automatically prepare for you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/695-0
00:04:58.023 --> 00:04:58.423
<v Hou, Eric>You don't.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/702-0
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.423
<v Hou, Eric>You do not have to download any CSV.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/730-0
00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:05.447
<v Hou, Eric>So you're just doing this way.
You can just download data in the RAM of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/730-1
00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Hou, Eric>these virtual machines and then every
time you just rerun it,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/730-2
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.853
<v Hou, Eric>you can just download it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/735-0
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.573
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just clear all the outputs on
Azure.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/739-0
00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:13.253
<v Hou, Eric>Run it for you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/741-0
00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:15.133
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you can run so then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/747-0
00:05:16.703 --> 00:05:17.623
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I just kicked the run.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/750-0
00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:18.223
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, do that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/752-0
00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:18.863
<v Hou, Eric>Where did it go?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/763-0
00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:22.152
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
So then you actually download the data or</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/763-1
00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:23.333
<v Hou, Eric>let me just clear it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/778-0
00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:28.133
<v Hou, Eric>You can just click here and here is
here's a run button right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/792-0
00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:32.099
<v Hou, Eric>So execute cell, you press it,
you actually download data for you in</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/792-1
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.053
<v Hou, Eric>case you wanna see the data right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/798-0
00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:36.293
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's see if you wanna see the
stock data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/814-0
00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:41.106
<v Hou, Eric>So you just you just put the name, stock,
under score data and then there's a.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/814-1
00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:42.933
<v Hou, Eric>There's a boundary called had.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/826-0
00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:46.293
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can show you the first five
rows of this data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/829-0
00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:48.493
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
the data will look like this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/838-0
00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:52.333
<v Hou, Eric>So ticker day 2010 one four.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/860-0
00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:56.563
<v Hou, Eric>So then you see the price of Apple,
the price of Google,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/860-1
00:05:56.563 --> 00:06:02.128
<v Hou, Eric>the price of Microsoft and NVIDIA and
Tesla is not available at that time,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/860-2
00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:02.573
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/882-0
00:06:02.573 --> 00:06:06.357
<v Hou, Eric>So then as you can see,
the video is only 4342 cents.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/882-1
00:06:06.357 --> 00:06:11.823
<v Hou, Eric>I hope I I purchased MVD at a time so
this is a way that you can actually see</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/882-2
00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:12.453
<v Hou, Eric>the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/889-0
00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:14.543
<v Hou, Eric>You can do a resp.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/894-0
00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:17.303
<v Hou, Eric>Free map free data so that you can
actually.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/896-0
00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:18.883
<v Hou, Eric>Feel the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/911-0
00:06:20.543 --> 00:06:24.343
<v Hou, Eric>The Plotly Plotly is a library that you
know you can use.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/919-0
00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:28.743
<v Hou, Eric>You can use the visualize data so they
actually two packages right now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/926-0
00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:31.703
<v Hou, Eric>Number one thing is Matt, plot lip.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/933-0
00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:33.583
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really a static image.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/937-0
00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:36.143
<v Hou, Eric>A Plotly is a interactive image.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/954-0
00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:39.172
<v Hou, Eric>So you don't have to change a lot of
things,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/954-1
00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:44.154
<v Hou, Eric>you just basically copy paste the code in
my call in my Jupiter notebook and change</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/954-2
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.103
<v Hou, Eric>the data source.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/959-0
00:06:46.183 --> 00:06:48.103
<v Hou, Eric>Change the the stock you want to see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/969-0
00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:51.373
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
I'm showing a video versus test line here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/976-0
00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:55.533
<v Hou, Eric>So you click this triangle,
you just ask you this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/991-0
00:06:57.143 --> 00:07:01.383
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna show you the NVIDIA stock price
over time over Tesla, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1010-0
00:07:01.383 --> 00:07:06.792
<v Hou, Eric>So then so you can see the stock price is
really like 400 or something for Tesla.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1010-1
00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.903
<v Hou, Eric>And then VDI is less, it's less.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1027-0
00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Hou, Eric>So it's quite and then you can see every
single day's data and as if you were</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1027-1
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.263
<v Hou, Eric>checking on Google or checking on any.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1030-0
00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.063
<v Hou, Eric>Any software?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1037-0
00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:21.213
<v Hou, Eric>Shared app around stocks, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1043-0
00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:25.093
<v Hou, Eric>So then you wanna prepare data, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1044-0
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:26.573
<v Hou, Eric>So then instead of.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1063-0
00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:32.271
<v Hou, Eric>Calc instead of just using the price
against the price,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1063-1
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.743
<v Hou, Eric>you actually care more about the returns,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1070-0
00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:37.663
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you wanna know the returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1093-0
00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:43.385
<v Hou, Eric>So this stab is going to help you
calculate the returns day by day or or</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1093-1
00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:47.103
<v Hou, Eric>business day or trading day by trading
day, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1097-0
00:07:47.103 --> 00:07:48.983
<v Hou, Eric>So then what you did? I'll, I'll show you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1103-0
00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:49.933
<v Hou, Eric>What it does?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1113-0
00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:54.213
<v Hou, Eric>So basically you can just run this cell
OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1119-0
00:07:54.213 --> 00:07:57.573
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see, add a code stop return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1144-0
00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:07.675
<v Hou, Eric>Had so you can run it so we can, like you,
show you day by day returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1144-1
00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:13.493
<v Hou, Eric>And so we didn't change it to basis point
just basically.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1152-0
00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:17.543
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see 2010 06/30.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1156-0
00:08:20.303 --> 00:08:20.583
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1161-0
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.103
<v Hou, Eric>So I just job those task levels.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1162-0
00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:24.543
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why maybe.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1164-0
00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:27.703
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1180-0
00:08:30.613 --> 00:08:38.322
<v Hou, Eric>So you can actually select the data as if
you were running the running the the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1180-1
00:08:38.322 --> 00:08:39.493
<v Hou, Eric>sequel code.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1182-0
00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:46.433
<v Hou, Eric>So date.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1184-0
00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:50.073
<v Hou, Eric>2003.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1186-0
00:08:53.213 --> 00:08:53.453
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1194-0
00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:57.143
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say 2020 and I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1204-0
00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:04.413
<v Hou, Eric>OK, there is no column called date.
Let's see what happened.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1207-0
00:09:13.503 --> 00:09:14.063
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1216-0
00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:17.543
<v Hou, Eric>All right. So then the data is the index,
so then you can say, OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1218-0
00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:18.583
<v Hou, Eric>Let's call it index.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1220-0
00:09:28.723 --> 00:09:29.923
<v Hou, Eric>Say this, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1223-0
00:09:32.053 --> 00:09:32.453
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1229-0
00:09:32.693 --> 00:09:34.173
<v Hou, Eric>So now you see the data, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1246-0
00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:40.409
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're saying the index is bigger
than equal to June 29th in the year of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1246-1
00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:41.333
<v Hou, Eric>2010, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1249-0
00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.053
<v Hou, Eric>So then you see Apple.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1275-0
00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:51.591
<v Hou, Eric>The date of June 29th is $7.
71 and then Apple on the next day is 7</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1275-1
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.743
<v Hou, Eric>dollar 5057 or $0.58.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1283-0
00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:58.303
<v Hou, Eric>So it's definitely declining a, you know,
a super small amount. So actually.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1286-0
00:10:00.063 --> 00:10:00.463
<v Hou, Eric>It declined.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1288-0
00:10:00.463 --> 00:10:00.983
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, where is it?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1298-0
00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:06.133
<v Hou, Eric>Like one point 1.8%.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1304-0
00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:11.083
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is a 3D comparing this
amount.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1310-0
00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:16.163
<v Hou, Eric>In case you don't trust me, minus.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1313-0
00:10:17.693 --> 00:10:18.133
<v Hou, Eric>This amount.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1317-0
00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:26.263
<v Hou, Eric>And divide by.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1319-0
00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:28.373
<v Hou, Eric>This.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1331-0
00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:34.853
<v Hou, Eric>So that that gonna give you one point 1.
8%. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1336-0
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.453
<v Hou, Eric>That's exactly the number we are seeing
here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1351-0
00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:43.285
<v Hou, Eric>So we have an active 1.
8% job on the day of the 30th versus the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1351-1
00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:43.693
<v Hou, Eric>29th.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1359-0
00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:46.453
<v Hou, Eric>So you have every single day's return in
the list.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1366-0
00:10:47.053 --> 00:10:51.693
<v Hou, Eric>So what I did is I merged this stock
return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1370-0
00:10:53.733 --> 00:10:55.813
<v Hou, Eric>With the market return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1389-0
00:10:56.163 --> 00:11:02.403
<v Hou, Eric>Which is the SP500 and considered as as a
as a as a market I also merge.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1395-0
00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:05.563
<v Hou, Eric>They stop return with the risk of free
right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1401-0
00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:09.163
<v Hou, Eric>So then the merger data set gonna look
like.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1410-0
00:11:09.933 --> 00:11:16.253
<v Hou, Eric>This so I have all the returns for those
stocks I have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1454-0
00:11:17.813 --> 00:11:25.584
<v Hou, Eric>I have this one as SP500 as proxy of the
market and I have these RLX as a proxy of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1454-1
00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:32.981
<v Hou, Eric>of risk of free so that you can actually
see for example the cumulative return</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1454-2
00:11:32.981 --> 00:11:38.973
<v Hou, Eric>between Tesla and NVIDIA so that NVIDIA
if you if you purchase.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1463-0
00:11:39.683 --> 00:11:44.443
<v Hou, Eric>At the first ever day,
you have already reached, I mean.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1470-0
00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:47.373
<v Hou, Eric>581 times.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1487-0
00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:53.044
<v Hou, Eric>So then you spend on you spend $1.00,
purchase some NVIDIA stocks,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1487-1
00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:55.213
<v Hou, Eric>you should have $581.00 now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1518-0
00:11:56.933 --> 00:12:00.629
<v Hou, Eric>For Tesla, it's 300 times.
So then you spend $1.00 on Tesla,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1518-1
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:05.657
<v Hou, Eric>you have $300.00 now and then. You know,
I I I really hope I spend some dollars on</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1518-2
00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:07.413
<v Hou, Eric>WIDIA at about at the moment.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1527-0
00:12:08.273 --> 00:12:11.913
<v Hou, Eric>But yes, so then back to the Cam model,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1552-0
00:12:11.913 --> 00:12:17.297
<v Hou, Eric>So then what we're doing is really we
need to calculate the market,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1552-1
00:12:17.297 --> 00:12:23.313
<v Hou, Eric>the market access return versus the stock
access return over the risk free.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1567-0
00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:31.328
<v Hou, Eric>So let's calculate the market access
return as using the the SP500 return</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1567-1
00:12:31.328 --> 00:12:33.353
<v Hou, Eric>minus the risk free.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1571-0
00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:34.973
<v Hou, Eric>So let's do that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1575-0
00:12:35.853 --> 00:12:37.773
<v Hou, Eric>You have the number. Let's let's.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1581-0
00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:39.443
<v Hou, Eric>Talk about NVIDIA.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1589-0
00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:44.163
<v Hou, Eric>So you change the stock name to NVIDIA
and then the.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1628-0
00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:52.651
<v Hou, Eric>Y you know in in in the Y in in a cat
model is the stock access return so that</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1628-1
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:59.624
<v Hou, Eric>the stock return over risk free where the
X is the market access return that's the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1628-2
00:12:59.624 --> 00:13:04.413
<v Hou, Eric>SP500 minus risk free.
So that I'm going to feed this Y.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1635-0
00:13:04.413 --> 00:13:08.893
<v Hou, Eric>And X in this SM original.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1637-0
00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:09.883
<v Hou, Eric>Linear.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1641-0
00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:12.853
<v Hou, Eric>Square model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1648-0
00:13:12.853 --> 00:13:15.373
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically linear regression
model, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1657-0
00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:17.333
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can see what a beta is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1660-0
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.013
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just run this model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1694-0
00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:25.409
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so this model this can model give me the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1694-1
00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:34.076
<v Hou, Eric>beta for NVIDIA across all many years is
1.65 that means if the market is 1%,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1694-2
00:13:34.076 --> 00:13:36.853
<v Hou, Eric>NVIDIA gonna go up 1.65%.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1697-0
00:13:36.853 --> 00:13:37.933
<v Hou, Eric>So basically just showing that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1725-0
00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:47.078
<v Hou, Eric>Is NVIDIA is quite sensitive to the
market volatilities right? So so 1.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1725-1
00:13:47.078 --> 00:13:55.664
<v Hou, Eric>65 and then let's see this compared to
some NVIDIA this this how accurate this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1725-2
00:13:55.664 --> 00:13:56.533
<v Hou, Eric>beta is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1743-0
00:13:58.323 --> 00:14:03.612
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see what is average return of
NVIDIA versus what's the average return</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1743-1
00:14:03.612 --> 00:14:04.683
<v Hou, Eric>based upon camp.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1752-0
00:14:05.483 --> 00:14:09.123
<v Hou, Eric>So then the average return base based on
my actual data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1759-0
00:14:09.123 --> 00:14:11.963
<v Hou, Eric>Is this so on every single day, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1764-0
00:14:11.963 --> 00:14:13.883
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a daily return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1788-0
00:14:13.883 --> 00:14:19.802
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a 21 basis point and then from
camp, the prediction is saying that OK,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1788-1
00:14:19.802 --> 00:14:23.843
<v Hou, Eric>based upon how the market goes and based
upon the beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1797-0
00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:28.413
<v Hou, Eric>So then predicted daily return on Vidia
is pretty much eight point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1823-0
00:14:29.043 --> 00:14:33.475
<v Hou, Eric>8.5 basis point.
So as you can see there is a quite big</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1823-1
00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:37.748
<v Hou, Eric>gap between media and and and this
account model. OK,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1823-2
00:14:37.748 --> 00:14:40.043
<v Hou, Eric>so I just wanna give a pause.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1836-0
00:14:40.043 --> 00:14:43.808
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically did you guys threw
of this Cam model and it's pretty</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1836-1
00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:45.283
<v Hou, Eric>fundamental model in finance?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1862-0
00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:52.716
<v Hou, Eric>How do you guys going to explain why the
actual return of NVIDIA is so different</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1862-1
00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:55.973
<v Hou, Eric>to the Cam predicted daily return of
NVIDIA?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1892-0
00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:02.680
<v Hou, Eric>Because I believe so many like professors
are teaching this model, the Cam model,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1892-1
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.966
<v Hou, Eric>and then we just use the real data for
NVIDIA and we've shown that you know what?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1892-2
00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:09.513
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite not accurate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1898-0
00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:13.633
<v Hou, Eric>What could be the possible reason why
this Cam model not accurate?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1918-0
00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:21.484
<v Benbenek, MATT>The that you're pulling the data from the
past like five years and NVIDIA really</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1913-0
00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:20.003
<v Hou, Eric>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1918-1
00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:24.253
<v Benbenek, MATT>only took off in the last couple years.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1920-0
00:15:24.783 --> 00:15:25.223
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1922-0
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:26.453
<v Benbenek, MATT>So yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1933-0
00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:29.823
<v Benbenek, MATT>So it's giving you a lower data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1926-0
00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:28.803
<v Hou, Eric>So that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1936-0
00:15:30.823 --> 00:15:32.103
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So I love that reason.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1946-0
00:15:32.103 --> 00:15:36.519
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just need to find my deck and
start putting those information over</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1946-1
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:36.863
<v Hou, Eric>there.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1961-0
00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:44.323
<v Hou, Eric>So we we we use NVIDIA as a as example,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1962-0
00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:46.723
<v Hou, Eric>So NVIDIA as a example.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1968-0
00:15:48.653 --> 00:15:51.733
<v Hou, Eric>Umm, so then we see the actual.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1976-0
00:15:53.413 --> 00:15:57.813
<v Hou, Eric>Daily return is 21 basis point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1980-0
00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:02.053
<v Hou, Eric>The cap predicted.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1982-0
00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:04.613
<v Hou, Eric>Daily return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1986-0
00:16:06.253 --> 00:16:07.773
<v Hou, Eric>Is 8.5.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1988-0
00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:10.373
<v Hou, Eric>Basis points.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1991-0
00:16:10.643 --> 00:16:11.683
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1994-0
00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:15.333
<v Hou, Eric>Quite inaccurate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/1996-0
00:16:17.773 --> 00:16:18.093
<v Hou, Eric>Why?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2007-0
00:16:19.733 --> 00:16:23.013
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah, Matt, you said so do you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2012-0
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.773
<v Hou, Eric>I I I hear what you're saying.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2024-0
00:16:24.773 --> 00:16:29.759
<v Hou, Eric>You said that when video just really like
increased a lot in the recent years</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2024-1
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.653
<v Hou, Eric>because of AI.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2047-0
00:16:30.933 --> 00:16:35.826
<v Hou, Eric>So do you consider do you are you going
to say that most recent two year is kind</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2047-1
00:16:35.826 --> 00:16:39.813
<v Hou, Eric>of anomaly for NVIDIA considering a long
history that NVIDIA has?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2052-0
00:16:40.443 --> 00:16:41.523
<v Hou, Eric>Or do we consider?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2062-0
00:16:43.653 --> 00:16:46.333
<v Hou, Eric>This is something that we should take
into consideration of our model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2092-0
00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:51.663
<v Benbenek, MATT>I I think we should take it into
consideration,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2092-1
00:16:51.663 --> 00:16:56.213
<v Benbenek, MATT>but since it hasn't like since we're
taking data from longer before then when</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2075-0
00:16:51.883 --> 00:16:52.323
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2092-2
00:16:56.213 --> 00:17:00.063
<v Benbenek, MATT>it started taking off,
the model is under estimating its returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2096-0
00:17:01.383 --> 00:17:02.263
<v Hou, Eric>Right. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2097-0
00:17:01.973 --> 00:17:02.453
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2103-0
00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:07.573
<v Hou, Eric>Price I increased significantly.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2111-0
00:17:13.003 --> 00:17:16.643
<v Hou, Eric>Two years and you said we should.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2116-0
00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:21.013
<v Hou, Eric>Consider AI as a driver.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2118-0
00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:23.763
<v Hou, Eric>In the model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2124-0
00:17:26.553 --> 00:17:29.033
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Any other any other thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2130-0
00:17:33.503 --> 00:17:34.303
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, by the way, you can see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2134-0
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.623
<v Hou, Eric>Still see my screen right the deck.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2140-0
00:17:39.473 --> 00:17:39.993
<v Hou, Eric>So yes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2142-0
00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:41.713
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah, we can see your screen.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2143-0
00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:41.993
<v Teske, Benjamin>Now we can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2149-0
00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:46.013
<v Hou, Eric>Any other thought like why you know?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2156-0
00:17:47.893 --> 00:17:49.853
<v Hou, Eric>Our Cam model is not quite accurate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2199-0
00:17:51.273 --> 00:17:56.538
<v Teske, Benjamin>It's basically the same as what Matt said,
but the model is using past data to make</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2199-1
00:17:56.538 --> 00:18:01.802
<v Teske, Benjamin>a prediction and so it's not always gonna
be 100% accurate obviously like it's it's</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2182-0
00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:58.833
<v Hou, Eric>Right, Yep.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2199-2
00:18:01.802 --> 00:18:06.753
<v Teske, Benjamin>it's doing its best to predict returns,
but the market's its own thing and is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2213-0
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.782
<v Teske, Benjamin>Volatile like we've seen today.
So it's not always gonna be able to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2203-0
00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:07.143
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2213-1
00:18:09.782 --> 00:18:11.073
<v Teske, Benjamin>estimate what's gonna happen.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2219-0
00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:13.283
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, it's only a model, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2229-0
00:18:13.283 --> 00:18:17.002
<v Hou, Eric>So the actual live is more complex than
the than than the model,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2229-1
00:18:17.002 --> 00:18:18.203
<v Hou, Eric>right the simulation.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2235-0
00:18:25.923 --> 00:18:27.923
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, good point. Any other.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2236-0
00:18:27.923 --> 00:18:28.723
<v Hou, Eric>Any other thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2260-0
00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:37.051
<v Mertens, Aidric>Single fact factor model so doesn't take
into account you know all the various</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2260-1
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:41.483
<v Mertens, Aidric>different components that a $3 trillion
company is a part of.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2253-0
00:18:39.183 --> 00:18:39.463
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2266-0
00:18:41.923 --> 00:18:44.403
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, it's a really static model, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2268-0
00:18:46.203 --> 00:18:46.803
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, go on.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2270-0
00:18:50.323 --> 00:18:50.883
<v Hou, Eric>Other folks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2272-0
00:19:02.283 --> 00:19:02.603
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2279-0
00:19:02.603 --> 00:19:04.203
<v Hou, Eric>All right. So those are good reasons,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2288-0
00:19:04.203 --> 00:19:06.803
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know,
it's really a timing kind of thing.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2322-0
00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:10.208
<v Hou, Eric>So then AI is definitely a driver and
then current model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2322-1
00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:13.612
<v Hou, Eric>We didn't even take into consideration of
AI as a driver.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2322-2
00:19:13.612 --> 00:19:16.312
<v Hou, Eric>So that definitely the model is not
accurate,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2322-3
00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:21.066
<v Hou, Eric>even though that model could be accurate.
But you know its prediction is still a</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2322-4
00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:23.003
<v Hou, Eric>prediction and it's just running.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2327-0
00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:23.563
<v Hou, Eric>A simulation.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2335-0
00:19:23.563 --> 00:19:27.443
<v Hou, Eric>We're just using whatever happened in the
past to understand what's driving.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2343-0
00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:30.053
<v Hou, Eric>What's really driving the the stock price,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2346-0
00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:31.613
<v Hou, Eric>So actual live could be more complex.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2356-0
00:19:31.843 --> 00:19:34.843
<v Hou, Eric>Try so then tomorrow there could be
another policy.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2359-0
00:19:34.843 --> 00:19:35.843
<v Hou, Eric>Another thing happens.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2379-0
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:41.156
<v Hou, Eric>So then it kind of significantly changed
the stock price and you know what we are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2379-1
00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:43.683
<v Hou, Eric>doing is really a market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2394-0
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:48.675
<v Hou, Eric>So this really a static model and really
arguably the simplest model that we have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2394-1
00:19:48.675 --> 00:19:49.283
<v Hou, Eric>ever seen.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2395-0
00:19:49.283 --> 00:19:49.523
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2396-0
00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:50.083
<v Hou, Eric>It's good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2402-0
00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:52.443
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's good reasons.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2411-0
00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:56.554
<v Hou, Eric>I I appreciate your your, your, your,
your your opinions is really awesome</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2411-1
00:19:56.554 --> 00:19:56.883
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2415-0
00:19:57.123 --> 00:19:58.923
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then and then, you know?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2428-0
00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:02.281
<v Hou, Eric>The financial, you know,
folks are also considered.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2428-1
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:04.093
<v Hou, Eric>Those are as as a reasons, right, so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2445-0
00:20:04.523 --> 00:20:09.654
<v Hou, Eric>And that's why people are transigoring
another model called the three factors,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2445-1
00:20:09.654 --> 00:20:10.043
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2448-0
00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:11.033
<v Hou, Eric>So let me have this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2454-0
00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:14.713
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, actually, if you run uh,
I run another call, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2463-0
00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.023
<v Hou, Eric>So then you run the model,
you can see the different coefficient,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2463-1
00:20:17.023 --> 00:20:17.233
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2512-0
00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:22.499
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually compare the
daily actual return to the predicted</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2512-1
00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:26.413
<v Hou, Eric>return of I.
I was using Apple in this example so then</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2512-2
00:20:26.413 --> 00:20:31.751
<v Hou, Eric>so this is every single day up and down
returns and the red are predicted,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2512-3
00:20:31.751 --> 00:20:35.593
<v Hou, Eric>predicted up and down returns right.
So then we know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2522-0
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.548
<v Hou, Eric>It's not as accurate,
but you know some of the times it is sort</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2522-1
00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:39.843
<v Hou, Eric>of OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2545-0
00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:44.585
<v Hou, Eric>OK.
And I also compared the cumulative growth</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2545-1
00:20:44.585 --> 00:20:51.457
<v Hou, Eric>for Apple right for Apple is much more
accurate coming starting from 2022</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2545-2
00:20:51.457 --> 00:20:53.593
<v Hou, Eric>January to end of 2024.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2557-0
00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:59.913
<v Hou, Eric>So this blue is cumulative. Actual return,
oh actual growth.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2568-0
00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:06.633
<v Hou, Eric>So eventually you you invest $100 on
Apple on the first day of 2022?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2570-0
00:21:06.793 --> 00:21:08.033
<v Hou, Eric>So eventually you could have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2576-0
00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:10.603
<v Hou, Eric>$135.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2587-0
00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.233
<v Hou, Eric>By the end of 2024.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2595-0
00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:17.593
<v Hou, Eric>But if you truly believe in the scam
model, you're going to show this track.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2611-0
00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:22.019
<v Hou, Eric>This and this trend,
so that eventually you know based upon</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2611-1
00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:24.353
<v Hou, Eric>Cam model, you're gonna have $130.00.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2614-0
00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:27.753
<v Hou, Eric>So arguably it could be accurate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2629-0
00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:31.425
<v Hou, Eric>However, timing is going to the thing,
so I said I you know,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2629-1
00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:33.833
<v Hou, Eric>you can argue I'm cherry picking, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2631-0
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:34.953
<v Hou, Eric>So then I chose.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2671-0
00:21:35.553 --> 00:21:39.155
<v Hou, Eric>This end of,
Umm 2024 to show you this chart where</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2671-1
00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:42.334
<v Hou, Eric>this,
this blue curve and this red curve are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2671-2
00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.936
<v Hou, Eric>pretty close.
If you argue you can say that's just</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2671-3
00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:51.233
<v Hou, Eric>choose the middle of 2023 to show the
chart. You can see it's quite big G.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2689-0
00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:55.171
<v Hou, Eric>In terms of accumulative growth,
quite big gap.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2689-1
00:21:55.171 --> 00:21:57.753
<v Hou, Eric>So that you argue it's not really
accurate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2700-0
00:21:57.753 --> 00:21:59.913
<v Hou, Eric>I I think both of those two argument are
right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2704-0
00:21:59.913 --> 00:22:01.873
<v Hou, Eric>So the timing is actually a big thing.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2711-0
00:22:02.683 --> 00:22:03.883
<v Hou, Eric>In in those in those models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2714-0
00:22:04.473 --> 00:22:05.033
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2751-0
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:11.619
<v Hou, Eric>So then there there is another famous
model because another famous model in the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2751-1
00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:14.761
<v Hou, Eric>market,
because you know that in in this Cam</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2751-2
00:22:14.761 --> 00:22:20.416
<v Hou, Eric>model we have only one regressor or one
information or one driver that is market</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2751-3
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:21.393
<v Hou, Eric>access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2765-0
00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:26.673
<v Hou, Eric>This is way to simplified so so Farma and
French.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2769-0
00:22:26.673 --> 00:22:30.033
<v Hou, Eric>So they invented another thing called 3
factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2784-0
00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:33.963
<v Hou, Eric>And then they folder instead into five
factor model or or or more.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2808-0
00:22:34.393 --> 00:22:38.478
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then so there and this Eugen Pharma is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2808-1
00:22:38.478 --> 00:22:43.313
<v Hou, Eric>still a professor at U Chicago and and
and French is not.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2818-0
00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:48.317
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you his website.
So then we can actually draw some some</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2818-1
00:22:48.317 --> 00:22:48.953
<v Hou, Eric>data from.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2822-0
00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:52.693
<v Hou, Eric>From his website.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2824-0
00:22:54.363 --> 00:22:54.523
<v Hou, Eric>Here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2834-0
00:22:55.823 --> 00:22:57.783
<v Hou, Eric>So currently he's this is his website.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2845-0
00:22:57.783 --> 00:23:02.136
<v Hou, Eric>So Kenneth French,
he's currently teaching at Dartmouth,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2845-1
00:23:02.136 --> 00:23:05.343
<v Hou, Eric>so it's a university in in the East Coast.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2852-0
00:23:07.923 --> 00:23:10.963
<v Hou, Eric>So so this is his personal website.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2864-0
00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:15.727
<v Hou, Eric>And then actually you can find a lot of
data from his website. For example,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2864-1
00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.643
<v Hou, Eric>he has a data library.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2879-0
00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:22.523
<v Hou, Eric>And then he's showing a lot of like 3
factor 5 factor models data here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2881-0
00:23:22.523 --> 00:23:24.043
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we gonna use the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2894-0
00:23:24.473 --> 00:23:27.357
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
we're gonna use the data in our three</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2894-1
00:23:27.357 --> 00:23:29.073
<v Hou, Eric>factor model exploration.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2899-0
00:23:29.673 --> 00:23:32.113
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just go back to my deck. Here we go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2908-0
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:36.913
<v Hou, Eric>So they found they found Cam is not
sufficient.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2924-0
00:23:36.913 --> 00:23:41.640
<v Hou, Eric>So then they wanted a three factor model
where the three factor models they have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2924-1
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.273
<v Hou, Eric>introduced two more factors.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2926-0
00:23:43.953 --> 00:23:44.993
<v Hou, Eric>That's the first one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2957-0
00:23:44.993 --> 00:23:50.858
<v Hou, Eric>They still use the market risk of premium,
which is the access return of the market,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2957-1
00:23:50.858 --> 00:23:55.066
<v Hou, Eric>which you can definitely use SB500 as a
proxy of the market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2957-2
00:23:55.066 --> 00:24:00.033
<v Hou, Eric>Another one they consider the size factor,
meaning the small minus big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2965-0
00:24:00.843 --> 00:24:03.643
<v Hou, Eric>So the small in terms of the company size.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2970-0
00:24:04.433 --> 00:24:05.953
<v Hou, Eric>Capital size.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2974-0
00:24:06.313 --> 00:24:08.393
<v Hou, Eric>So they believe the small.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2994-0
00:24:09.963 --> 00:24:15.691
<v Hou, Eric>Smaller companies in terms of the the
enterprise value would beat the big</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/2994-1
00:24:15.691 --> 00:24:19.483
<v Hou, Eric>companies also in terms of the enterprise
value.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3001-0
00:24:19.643 --> 00:24:21.803
<v Hou, Eric>So then they consider this as a size
factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3019-0
00:24:22.363 --> 00:24:25.174
<v Hou, Eric>Another one they consider is a value
factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3019-1
00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:29.483
<v Hou, Eric>They believe the high book to market
value gonna be the another one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3028-0
00:24:29.483 --> 00:24:32.923
<v Hou, Eric>So then they they consider the other two
factors in the model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3031-0
00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:34.233
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3036-0
00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:36.993
<v Hou, Eric>So then size factor and value factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3038-0
00:24:38.603 --> 00:24:38.683
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3044-0
00:24:40.283 --> 00:24:41.443
<v Hou, Eric>Book value to market value.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3049-0
00:24:41.443 --> 00:24:43.323
<v Hou, Eric>So then consider it's high and then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3063-0
00:24:44.923 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Hou, Eric>And then so they called it value value
stocks and then then the low ratios.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3063-1
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.403
<v Hou, Eric>So if you were.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3075-0
00:24:54.163 --> 00:24:58.123
<v Hou, Eric>If you were Eugene Fama and and and Ken
French.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3091-0
00:24:59.883 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Hou, Eric>You're you know that this this market
access return will not be sufficient to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3091-1
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.883
<v Hou, Eric>build a model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3093-0
00:25:06.963 --> 00:25:07.763
<v Hou, Eric>You think?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3111-0
00:25:09.523 --> 00:25:15.477
<v Hou, Eric>A size factor, a value factor.
Gonna improve your model a lot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3111-1
00:25:15.477 --> 00:25:19.163
<v Hou, Eric>Where by the way, that was proven true.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3116-0
00:25:19.243 --> 00:25:20.203
<v Hou, Eric>And here's a formula.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3123-0
00:25:20.963 --> 00:25:25.523
<v Hou, Eric>The question is how are you guys going to
design that experiment?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3135-0
00:25:27.403 --> 00:25:31.723
<v Hou, Eric>You know you have a belief,
you have to show that using the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3149-0
00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:35.247
<v Hou, Eric>That whatever you're believing in is
correct.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3149-1
00:25:35.247 --> 00:25:39.003
<v Hou, Eric>And how are you guys going to design an
experiment?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3155-0
00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:42.673
<v Hou, Eric>And prove that whatever you're believing
in is correct.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3170-0
00:25:48.293 --> 00:25:52.219
<v Hou, Eric>Dude. OK, first first first,
first question to confirm you guys know</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3170-1
00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:53.413
<v Hou, Eric>the questions, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3179-0
00:25:53.413 --> 00:25:58.413
<v Hou, Eric>You guys know the question I'm asking you
to design an experiment to show.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3200-0
00:25:59.963 --> 00:26:07.803
<v Hou, Eric>How to prove the size factor value factor
really going to affect one stock's return?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3202-0
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.163
<v Hou, Eric>How do you design that?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3228-0
00:26:17.373 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Barbel, Sam>I think you would have to start with like
what you already know or what's already</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3228-1
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.138
<v Barbel, Sam>proven and then connect.
I guess a bunch of those steps together</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3228-2
00:26:27.138 --> 00:26:28.533
<v Barbel, Sam>to get to your point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3258-0
00:26:29.493 --> 00:26:32.518
<v Hou, Eric>Sure.
So basically you want you are saying that</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3258-1
00:26:32.518 --> 00:26:37.686
<v Hou, Eric>let's just utilize whatever we know and
then acknowledging that whatever we don't</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3258-2
00:26:37.686 --> 00:26:42.349
<v Hou, Eric>know and see if we can derive anything
that's that's a Fact Check, right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3258-3
00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:42.853
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3261-0
00:26:44.683 --> 00:26:45.643
<v Hou, Eric>No, we don't.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3263-0
00:26:49.393 --> 00:26:49.993
<v Hou, Eric>And we don't know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3272-0
00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:58.453
<v Hou, Eric>You know that's a good strategy usually,
right? So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3284-0
00:27:00.873 --> 00:27:04.531
<v Hou, Eric>That's very good strategy as as a project
manager,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3284-1
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:07.113
<v Hou, Eric>but how do you design an experiment?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3287-0
00:27:08.683 --> 00:27:09.643
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3288-0
00:27:09.683 --> 00:27:09.723
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3310-0
00:27:09.723 --> 00:27:11.903
<v Hou, Eric>I I got an experiment. Something right?
So then,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3310-1
00:27:11.903 --> 00:27:14.794
<v Hou, Eric>since we were talking about experiment,
I gotta split the teams.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3310-2
00:27:14.794 --> 00:27:15.683
<v Hou, Eric>So we have 21 folks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3320-0
00:27:15.683 --> 00:27:19.403
<v Hou, Eric>I'm gonna split the teams into, let's say,
five groups, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3335-0
00:27:19.403 --> 00:27:24.749
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can have a 5 minute
discussion and then I so eventually we</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3335-1
00:27:24.749 --> 00:27:27.083
<v Hou, Eric>have we have 5:00 rooms, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3345-0
00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:29.675
<v Hou, Eric>So 5 rooms.
So the I just wanna listen to every</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3345-1
00:27:29.675 --> 00:27:30.323
<v Hou, Eric>single room.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3348-0
00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:31.323
<v Hou, Eric>What's your opinion?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3355-0
00:27:31.913 --> 00:27:32.833
<v Hou, Eric>What's your suggestion?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3360-0
00:27:32.833 --> 00:27:35.313
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say 5 minutes and then we come back
this room, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3370-0
00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:40.743
<v Hou, Eric>So I got to experiment.
This teams functions right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3377-0
00:27:40.743 --> 00:27:43.743
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm going to choose a number of
rooms.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3408-0
00:27:43.743 --> 00:27:48.043
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to create a group 5,
so I'm going to create rooms and then you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3408-1
00:27:48.043 --> 00:27:52.755
<v Hou, Eric>guys gonna see your peers in different
rooms and hopefully you're gonna use the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3408-2
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:56.171
<v Hou, Eric>time 5 minutes.
We come back 617 and then we are going to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3408-3
00:27:56.171 --> 00:27:57.643
<v Hou, Eric>ask you guys to say what?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3415-0
00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:00.503
<v Hou, Eric>You think your design will be OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3418-0
00:28:00.583 --> 00:28:01.663
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just do that now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3423-0
00:28:02.383 --> 00:28:03.783
<v Hou, Eric>No guarantee that you got success.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3427-0
00:28:08.663 --> 00:28:09.863
<v Hou, Eric>We are creating rules.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3431-0
00:28:18.243 --> 00:28:18.723
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3434-0
00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:21.833
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3435-0
00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:22.433
<v Hou, Eric>Here we go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3455-0
00:28:27.943 --> 00:28:28.103
<v Hou, Eric>Bye.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3462-0
00:28:34.013 --> 00:28:37.133
<v Hou, Eric>Wait, Christian,
why are you still here with me?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3490-0
00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:04.993

00:30:05.433 --> 00:30:07.273
<v Hou, Eric>Hello. Yes, how can I help you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3497-0
00:30:10.233 --> 00:30:11.513
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Hello, can you hear me?</v>

<v Brozynski, Jaden>Yep, there we go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3507-0
00:30:14.453 --> 00:30:15.413
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry, what?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3509-0
00:30:15.533 --> 00:30:16.293
<v Hou, Eric>How can I help you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3522-0
00:30:17.763 --> 00:30:21.683
<v Brozynski, Jaden>I didn't get put into a group. Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3520-0
00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:20.643
<v Hou, Eric>Any room.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3524-0
00:30:21.563 --> 00:30:22.283
<v Hou, Eric>Oh really?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3530-0
00:30:22.683 --> 00:30:24.803
<v Hou, Eric>Gosh, do you want to discuss with me?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3531-0
00:30:25.503 --> 00:30:25.983
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Sure.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3542-0
00:30:26.973 --> 00:30:30.453
<v Hou, Eric>I I you know what I can add you to room 4
is let me let me see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3544-0
00:30:32.813 --> 00:30:32.973
<v Hou, Eric>Gosh.</v>

<v Hou, Eric>I'm just clicking some random.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3558-0
00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:42.373
<v Hou, Eric>Random plus sign and then it didn't show
a sign.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3560-0

00:31:06.923 --> 00:31:08.403
<v Hou, Eric>Are you actually room 5?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3577-0
00:31:11.983 --> 00:31:12.503
<v Hou, Eric>Are you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3581-0
00:31:13.103 --> 00:31:15.503
<v Hou, Eric>So did they kick you out?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3583-0
00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:16.473

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3593-0
00:31:18.313 --> 00:31:20.833
<v Brozynski, Jaden>I think my the call might have just
crashed.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3598-0
00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:23.403
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, I see that makes sense.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3605-0
00:31:24.443 --> 00:31:27.363
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
but because I do see you're in room 5 and.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3611-0
00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:30.573
<v Hou, Eric>I can ask you to Join Now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3613-0
00:31:31.363 --> 00:31:31.923

00:31:41.903 --> 00:31:44.423
<v Hou, Eric>But I can still see you here for whatever
reason.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3629-0
00:31:45.523 --> 00:31:48.043
<v Brozynski, Jaden>Here I'm I think it's a separate call I'm
joining.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3633-0
00:31:48.043 --> 00:31:49.043
<v Brozynski, Jaden>So let's see if this works.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3636-0
00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:50.193

00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:51.873
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. Because I see, yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3753-0
00:37:01.573 --> 00:37:02.773
<v Hou, Eric>And welcome back.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3761-0
00:37:06.263 --> 00:37:09.103
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, just make sure you guys do hear me.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3759-0
00:37:07.033 --> 00:37:07.353
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Thank you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3763-0
00:37:10.613 --> 00:37:10.933
<v Hou, Eric>Welcome back.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3769-0
00:37:12.573 --> 00:37:13.773
<v Hou, Eric>Let me share my screen again.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3771-0
00:37:15.453 --> 00:37:15.973
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3787-0
00:37:17.573 --> 00:37:21.893
<v Hou, Eric>We have 5:00 rooms and then I,
I I prepared a stack like 5 rooms.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3799-0
00:37:24.013 --> 00:37:26.879
<v Hou, Eric>Room one.
I have no idea who's who's in room 1.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3799-1
00:37:26.879 --> 00:37:27.893
<v Hou, Eric>What's your idea?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3810-0
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:35.773
<v Capozzoli, Jay>I don't know if a room run,
but we said to compare it to Cap M.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3815-0
00:37:37.293 --> 00:37:38.293
<v Hou, Eric>Compared to Cam M.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3827-0
00:37:43.213 --> 00:37:48.573
<v Hou, Eric>Compared to oh, you want to,
you're saying is you have the return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3829-0
00:37:48.573 --> 00:37:49.333
<v Hou, Eric>You have M.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3833-0
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.133
<v Hou, Eric>You want to explain those residuals?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3842-0
00:37:51.133 --> 00:37:54.053
<v Hou, Eric>What? What do you mean by compared to yes?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3865-0
00:37:53.623 --> 00:37:57.758
<v Capozzoli, Jay>Like if the if the R-squared is better in
the three factor model like it means it</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3865-1
00:37:57.758 --> 00:38:00.632
<v Capozzoli, Jay>would work better than compared to the
one factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3865-2
00:38:00.632 --> 00:38:01.943
<v Capozzoli, Jay>It's like comparing it to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3863-0
00:38:01.043 --> 00:38:01.603
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3869-0
00:38:03.173 --> 00:38:04.693
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, R Square is an indicator.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3871-0
00:38:07.093 --> 00:38:07.293
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3878-0
00:38:09.973 --> 00:38:13.613
<v Hou, Eric>To show that three factor model is better,
OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3881-0
00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:19.403
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3882-0
00:38:19.403 --> 00:38:19.803
<v Hou, Eric>That's good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3886-0
00:38:21.813 --> 00:38:23.213
<v Hou, Eric>Who's who's in room 2?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3891-0
00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:34.503
<v Hou, Eric>Jay, are you in room 2 actually?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3894-0
00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:35.883
<v Capozzoli, Jay>Was I?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3896-0
00:38:35.923 --> 00:38:36.843
<v Capozzoli, Jay>Yeah, I don't know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3900-0
00:38:37.923 --> 00:38:39.163
<v Capozzoli, Jay>I was in one of the rooms, yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3903-0
00:38:39.773 --> 00:38:41.933
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Who who was in room 1?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3907-0
00:38:44.593 --> 00:38:45.593
<v Severin, Noah>I think that was our group.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3913-0
00:38:45.593 --> 00:38:47.073
<v Severin, Noah>We were room 1.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3917-0
00:38:46.013 --> 00:38:49.173
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, yeah, yeah. Noah, what do you think?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3927-0
00:38:49.413 --> 00:38:53.693
<v Severin, Noah>We we also had a similar idea was to
essentially.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3932-0
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.533
<v Severin, Noah>Use the two models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3935-0
00:38:58.253 --> 00:38:58.533
<v Severin, Noah>And then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3952-0
00:39:01.013 --> 00:39:04.695
<v Severin, Noah>Essentially,
take data in like as the stock performs</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3952-1
00:39:04.695 --> 00:39:08.933
<v Severin, Noah>and then run a regression to see which
model perform better.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3964-0
00:39:09.293 --> 00:39:12.338
<v Hou, Eric>Hey,
compared to actuals and then see see</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3964-1
00:39:12.338 --> 00:39:13.933
<v Hou, Eric>which ones fit better.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3973-0
00:39:17.683 --> 00:39:19.323
<v Hou, Eric>Cool. Yeah, it was a good idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3975-0
00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:20.403
<v Hou, Eric>Who was in room 3?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3982-0
00:39:31.613 --> 00:39:32.573
<v Hou, Eric>Room 3, folks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3984-0
00:39:37.063 --> 00:39:37.103
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/3991-0
00:39:37.103 --> 00:39:40.223
<v Hou, Eric>I guess is it fair to assume that you
guys have the same idea?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4009-0
00:39:41.773 --> 00:39:45.113
<v Hou, Eric>So you just wanna, you know,
take the data compared to the, you know,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4009-1
00:39:45.113 --> 00:39:48.213
<v Hou, Eric>predictions versus actuals is that is
that everyone believes in.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4024-0
00:39:50.573 --> 00:39:55.013
<v Carone, Matt>Yeah, I don't know what room I was in,
but we kind of said a lot similar to that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4022-0
00:39:53.413 --> 00:39:53.933
<v Hou, Eric>Sure.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4028-0
00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.573
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4034-0
00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:57.813
<v Carone, Matt>I don't know if I was room 3 or not.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4032-0
00:39:56.693 --> 00:39:56.973
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4040-0
00:39:56.733 --> 00:40:01.813
<v Hou, Eric>I I oh, I mean, like,
this team's room sucks because.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4058-0
00:40:03.813 --> 00:40:08.848
<v Hou, Eric>In another software is then you.
You can clearly tell which room you are.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4058-1
00:40:08.848 --> 00:40:11.093
<v Hou, Eric>OK. I'll. I'll take it next time.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4068-0
00:40:11.093 --> 00:40:14.213
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have different folks in the
static room.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4073-0
00:40:14.283 --> 00:40:16.763
<v Hou, Eric>Rooms on and that may be easier, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4080-0
00:40:16.763 --> 00:40:18.830
<v Hou, Eric>So then yeah,
so we just compare the actual numbers,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4080-1
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.883
<v Hou, Eric>right? So then that's good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4085-0
00:40:21.973 --> 00:40:23.253
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4090-0
00:40:25.293 --> 00:40:26.333
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4092-0
00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:27.693
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's actually compare.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4096-0
00:40:29.253 --> 00:40:30.013
<v Hou, Eric>Let me show you the code.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4098-0
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:32.573
<v Hou, Eric>Here we go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4115-0
00:40:34.613 --> 00:40:39.453
<v Hou, Eric>By the way, I was using.
Let me show you the data I was downloaded.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4116-0
00:40:39.893 --> 00:40:39.933
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4122-0
00:40:39.933 --> 00:40:44.253
<v Hou, Eric>I download this app research data factor
daily from.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4155-0
00:40:46.133 --> 00:40:50.745
<v Hou, Eric>From this website and then I will
recommend you doing the same if you want</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4155-1
00:40:50.745 --> 00:40:53.819
<v Hou, Eric>to really follow these three factor
models right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4155-2
00:40:53.819 --> 00:40:56.893
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can certainly see the phma of
French.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4157-0
00:40:57.493 --> 00:40:58.573
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just zoom in.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4164-0
00:41:00.573 --> 00:41:03.333
<v Hou, Eric>There is a Fama French three factor
models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4186-0
00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:10.484
<v Hou, Eric>So that you can choose to use weekly data,
you can choose use the daily data and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4186-1
00:41:10.484 --> 00:41:14.733
<v Hou, Eric>even more, there is a farmer, farmer,
friend 5 factor models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4200-0
00:41:16.413 --> 00:41:20.173
<v Hou, Eric>I was really using three factor and five
factor is really optional for you guys.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4216-0
00:41:22.093 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Hou, Eric>Because we are calculating,
we were calculating the daily return,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4216-1
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.533
<v Hou, Eric>which is the daily daily daily changes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4234-0
00:41:30.243 --> 00:41:32.978
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then you can just basically download</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4234-1
00:41:32.978 --> 00:41:36.003
<v Hou, Eric>this CSV from this website or you can
download CSD.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4236-0
00:41:36.003 --> 00:41:37.003
<v Hou, Eric>But anyway, so you can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4242-0
00:41:37.163 --> 00:41:38.643
<v Hou, Eric>You can load this data to Python.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4260-0
00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:46.908
<v Hou, Eric>And definitely you can sell.
You can see this is the data returns from</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4260-1
00:41:46.908 --> 00:41:48.133
<v Hou, Eric>1926 to 2024.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4282-0
00:41:49.733 --> 00:41:55.345
<v Hou, Eric>November 30th and then the annual returns
are basically from 27 to 23 and here are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4282-1
00:41:55.345 --> 00:42:00.213
<v Hou, Eric>some description how you gonna use the
data from from a French website.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4292-0
00:42:02.573 --> 00:42:05.911
<v Hou, Eric>Once you download it,
I have to say let me just actually</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4292-1
00:42:05.911 --> 00:42:06.613
<v Hou, Eric>download it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4295-0
00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:09.523
<v Hou, Eric>Big deal.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4306-0
00:42:09.843 --> 00:42:13.455
<v Hou, Eric>Let me download it.
Let's say you're gonna use sorry three</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4306-1
00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:13.883
<v Hou, Eric>factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4309-0
00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:16.173
<v Hou, Eric>Download CSV.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4311-0
00:42:17.893 --> 00:42:18.533
<v Hou, Eric>When we download it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4320-0
00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:24.653
<v Hou, Eric>It's actually going to the zip file and
you open it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4335-0
00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:36.173
<v Hou, Eric>You actually need to clean the data a
little bit if you wanna use it as a CSV.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4365-0
00:42:36.173 --> 00:42:43.920
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is there's some description of
what this data is so that you don't have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4365-1
00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:50.453
<v Hou, Eric>the headers of data immediately so that
you may have to delete those.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4369-0
00:42:52.013 --> 00:42:53.853
<v Hou, Eric>4 rows and this one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4371-0
00:42:55.853 --> 00:42:57.293
<v Hou, Eric>Data row.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4385-0
00:43:00.803 --> 00:43:08.883
<v Hou, Eric>And for this date there is no column
names, so you may have to manually.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4389-0
00:43:10.453 --> 00:43:11.813
<v Hou, Eric>Enter a column name here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4410-0
00:43:13.403 --> 00:43:18.146
<v Hou, Eric>And you can definitely adjust it the the
width of those columns. As you can see,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4410-1
00:43:18.146 --> 00:43:21.483
<v Hou, Eric>once you did that,
the state column is still super wide.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4417-0
00:43:22.363 --> 00:43:25.483
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is if you Scroll down to the
bottom.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4424-0
00:43:27.053 --> 00:43:28.573
<v Hou, Eric>And they have a copyright statement.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4455-0
00:43:30.293 --> 00:43:35.079
<v Hou, Eric>In order to use the data,
I acknowledge the copyright,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4455-1
00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:40.473
<v Hou, Eric>I'll delete it. OK,
so you delete those now this data is when</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4455-2
00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:45.693
<v Hou, Eric>you shrink the the width and then you see
it's normal L OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4470-0
00:43:45.853 --> 00:43:49.386
<v Hou, Eric>So this is data you can actually use in
in your Python code,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4470-1
00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:51.413
<v Hou, Eric>and it's really really easy to use.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4477-0
00:43:52.203 --> 00:43:55.723
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise you gonna report some issues.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4482-0
00:43:56.803 --> 00:44:00.083
<v Hou, Eric>Ki don't wanna. I don't wanna save it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4511-0
00:44:01.653 --> 00:44:05.611
<v Hou, Eric>This data I already uploaded for my for
my demonstration.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4511-1
00:44:05.611 --> 00:44:10.933
<v Hou, Eric>I already changed those format and then
delete anything I told you to delete.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4534-0
00:44:11.293 --> 00:44:14.253
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just show you this three factor
model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4534-1
00:44:14.253 --> 00:44:19.024
<v Hou, Eric>So still we're gonna still download the
data, for example, download the Apple,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4534-2
00:44:19.024 --> 00:44:20.533
<v Hou, Eric>Microsoft, Google, Tesla.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4548-0
00:44:21.403 --> 00:44:28.963
<v Hou, Eric>NVIDIA as was and then instead of showing
this so I am.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4562-0
00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:34.835
<v Hou, Eric>Yes,
I'm going to import this farmer French</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4562-1
00:44:34.835 --> 00:44:35.573
<v Hou, Eric>factors.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4567-0
00:44:36.053 --> 00:44:38.373
<v Hou, Eric>So what I did is I'm reading.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4582-0
00:44:39.973 --> 00:44:45.333
<v Hou, Eric>From this CSV and save the data into a
pandas data frame.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4594-0
00:44:47.093 --> 00:44:52.773
<v Hou, Eric>I convert the data column I created as a
data time.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4633-0
00:44:53.753 --> 00:45:02.230
<v Hou, Eric>Because you know the Python pandas tables
are are quite sensitive to the column</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4633-1
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:09.965
<v Hou, Eric>types. When you need to merge them,
you do not want to merge a data time</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4633-2
00:45:09.965 --> 00:45:13.673
<v Hou, Eric>column to a column that is numbers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4647-0
00:45:13.673 --> 00:45:19.056
<v Hou, Eric>You know integers because if you do that,
this merge statement or merge command</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4647-1
00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:20.873
<v Hou, Eric>gonna give you some errors.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4662-0
00:45:21.913 --> 00:45:28.233
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why is it's tricky to merge the
different types together.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4669-0
00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:31.313
<v Hou, Eric>So let me let me just show you show you
this data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4676-0
00:45:31.983 --> 00:45:33.303
<v Hou, Eric>I think we can actually run it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4696-0
00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:38.166
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just run regular things,
download data like you've seen already</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4696-1
00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:43.223
<v Hou, Eric>and show you OK the the stock return
looks like I already calculated returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4705-0
00:45:43.823 --> 00:45:46.663
<v Hou, Eric>I'll calculate the apple returns as
average.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4712-0
00:45:47.503 --> 00:45:49.263
<v Hou, Eric>This one you have seen as well.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4737-0
00:45:49.263 --> 00:45:53.203
<v Hou, Eric>So Apple, I'm sorry.
NVIDIA versus Tesla in terms of price.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4737-1
00:45:53.203 --> 00:45:57.012
<v Hou, Eric>And this tab is,
I'm really going to import those factors</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4737-2
00:45:57.012 --> 00:46:01.543
<v Hou, Eric>instead of I'm changing these the data
time and let me just comment.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4742-0
00:46:03.203 --> 00:46:04.363
<v Hou, Eric>Let me come on this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4744-0
00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:05.803
<v Hou, Eric>Let me come on this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4750-0
00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:08.613
<v Hou, Eric>So then you still load the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4756-0
00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:11.053
<v Hou, Eric>You do not do any changes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4770-0
00:46:11.053 --> 00:46:14.445
<v Hou, Eric>You just wanna read the data into
dependence data frame,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4770-1
00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:15.813
<v Hou, Eric>so then you do this OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4776-0
00:46:17.453 --> 00:46:19.293
<v Hou, Eric>Succeed succeeded.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4790-0
00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:23.493
<v Hou, Eric>Loading the data into data frame so you
can do you copy this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4795-0
00:46:23.493 --> 00:46:27.093
<v Hou, Eric>So here there is like one comment called
D types.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4801-0
00:46:29.623 --> 00:46:31.503
<v Hou, Eric>And you run the times you see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4816-0
00:46:33.253 --> 00:46:37.529
<v Hou, Eric>See the date.
The data frame is considered data as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4816-1
00:46:37.529 --> 00:46:39.373
<v Hou, Eric>integers, is it right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4824-0
00:46:41.013 --> 00:46:43.573
<v Hou, Eric>Arguably they're doing the right thing.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4830-0
00:46:43.573 --> 00:46:46.053
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is if you actually see the
data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4837-0
00:46:48.203 --> 00:46:49.843
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, you actually see the data used.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4858-0
00:46:49.843 --> 00:46:56.683
<v Hou, Eric>You know the data is 19260701 as As for a
human being, I know this is a date.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4872-0
00:46:56.683 --> 00:47:02.323
<v Hou, Eric>But for machine it doesn't tell whether
it's a date or just a string of integers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4876-0
00:47:02.763 --> 00:47:05.083
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why you need to run this
command.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4885-0
00:47:06.653 --> 00:47:08.173
<v Hou, Eric>To convert it to the date time.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4892-0
00:47:08.213 --> 00:47:12.213
<v Hou, Eric>So once you do that, you rerun it, OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4896-0
00:47:12.893 --> 00:47:15.053
<v Hou, Eric>You check the D times.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4898-0
00:47:15.093 --> 00:47:16.493
<v Hou, Eric>Now it's day times.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4904-0
00:47:17.283 --> 00:47:18.363
<v Hou, Eric>OK, change format.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4933-0
00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:28.786
<v Hou, Eric>Another thing is you see the market
access return .110 small minus big minus .</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4933-1
00:47:28.786 --> 00:47:34.403
<v Hou, Eric>25 high minus low minus .27 risk free .
009.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4937-0
00:47:34.403 --> 00:47:36.363
<v Hou, Eric>So those are actually basis point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4941-0
00:47:36.643 --> 00:47:38.283
<v Hou, Eric>Remember, we did not.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4948-0
00:47:38.283 --> 00:47:40.963
<v Hou, Eric>We did not convert of, we didn't.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4951-0
00:47:40.963 --> 00:47:43.203
<v Hou, Eric>We didn't convert our daily return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4960-0
00:47:44.013 --> 00:47:46.693
<v Hou, Eric>To basis point, we just leave it as was.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4976-0
00:47:46.923 --> 00:47:51.226
<v Hou, Eric>So then to make sure that units are
consistent so that I divide everything by</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4976-1
00:47:51.226 --> 00:47:52.163
<v Hou, Eric>100 to make sure.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4996-0
00:47:53.733 --> 00:47:59.581
<v Hou, Eric>From the from the French model data,
I have raw numbers instead of basis point,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/4996-1
00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:01.773
<v Hou, Eric>so that if you rerun it again.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5006-0
00:48:04.283 --> 00:48:07.243
<v Hou, Eric>You see the data types are are correct.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5013-0
00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:12.563
<v Hou, Eric>You see the the data looks not quite the
data looks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5015-0
00:48:14.413 --> 00:48:15.333
<v Hou, Eric>Correct now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5038-0
00:48:17.093 --> 00:48:21.717
<v Hou, Eric>And then you want to merge it to,
you know the stock returns and and just</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5038-1
00:48:21.717 --> 00:48:25.653
<v Hou, Eric>demonstrate why you need to convert the
date time you can see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5052-0
00:48:29.763 --> 00:48:34.563
<v Hou, Eric>You can see the data,
the data types of the stock about.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5059-0
00:48:34.763 --> 00:48:38.403
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, I know this is a index.
So then so that's.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5065-0
00:48:40.413 --> 00:48:41.973
<v Hou, Eric>So you merged them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5073-0
00:48:43.813 --> 00:48:45.293
<v Hou, Eric>Date. Yeah. Where?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5078-0
00:48:45.373 --> 00:48:49.253
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, I didn't add a date here.
Did I start or?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5086-0
00:48:52.933 --> 00:48:54.373
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, I didn't convert that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5088-0
00:48:54.373 --> 00:48:55.733
<v Hou, Eric>It's 228, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5094-0
00:49:03.613 --> 00:49:05.173
<v Hou, Eric>See if I can marry commercial.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5097-0
00:49:06.733 --> 00:49:07.213
<v Hou, Eric>I suspect it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5104-0
00:49:11.413 --> 00:49:12.093
<v Hou, Eric>OK you can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5107-0
00:49:12.093 --> 00:49:13.173
<v Hou, Eric>You can still merge them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5120-0
00:49:13.173 --> 00:49:16.893
<v Hou, Eric>So the stock this and this on the date
and then you can actually merge it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5124-0
00:49:17.173 --> 00:49:21.813
<v Hou, Eric>So then you see the stock return date
again.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5127-0
00:49:23.483 --> 00:49:24.603
<v Hou, Eric>You have everything.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5130-0
00:49:26.173 --> 00:49:26.733
<v Hou, Eric>You have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5135-0
00:49:28.373 --> 00:49:29.573
<v Hou, Eric>Those stocks returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5137-0
00:49:31.293 --> 00:49:31.613
<v Hou, Eric>You have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5156-0
00:49:33.213 --> 00:49:37.879
<v Hou, Eric>You have the market access return,
you have small minus big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5156-1
00:49:37.879 --> 00:49:40.173
<v Hou, Eric>You have these high minus low.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5163-0
00:49:40.173 --> 00:49:43.493
<v Hou, Eric>You have risk free and then you can
compare this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5179-0
00:49:46.293 --> 00:49:51.290
<v Hou, Eric>This this is the Apple Daily return
median which is the 50 percentile versus</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5179-1
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:52.653
<v Hou, Eric>market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5205-0
00:49:53.163 --> 00:49:57.183
<v Hou, Eric>So you see,
the apple return is 9 basis point,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5205-1
00:49:57.183 --> 00:50:04.195
<v Hou, Eric>the market access return is 7 basis point
and these they are in the same you know</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5205-2
00:50:04.195 --> 00:50:05.563
<v Hou, Eric>similar numbers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5211-0
00:50:05.563 --> 00:50:08.563
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know they should be right, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5218-0
00:50:08.883 --> 00:50:12.003
<v Hou, Eric>So now this let's do Cam model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5247-0
00:50:13.693 --> 00:50:18.793
<v Hou, Eric>So we do Cam model just want to show that
so Cam model we still run this and then</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5247-1
00:50:18.793 --> 00:50:22.773
<v Hou, Eric>this is the way how you get the beta
which is 1.0697 for Apple.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5249-0
00:50:22.843 --> 00:50:23.003
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5251-0
00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:26.243
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5256-0
00:50:27.813 --> 00:50:29.973
<v Hou, Eric>And then first three factor models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5278-0
00:50:31.813 --> 00:50:36.035
<v Hou, Eric>You you remember in, in, in, in,
in a Cam model,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5278-1
00:50:36.035 --> 00:50:40.773
<v Hou, Eric>your regressor is only the market access
return right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5295-0
00:50:40.973 --> 00:50:45.890
<v Hou, Eric>So just market minus risk free,
but for three factor models you have to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5295-1
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.733
<v Hou, Eric>put all three of them here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5305-0
00:50:47.733 --> 00:50:53.973
<v Hou, Eric>So going to be market access return small
minus big and also high minus low.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5318-0
00:50:54.813 --> 00:50:57.909
<v Hou, Eric>So you, you're gonna.
You're gonna run a 3 factor models in</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5318-1
00:50:57.909 --> 00:50:58.373
<v Hou, Eric>this way.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5325-0
00:50:58.373 --> 00:51:02.373
<v Hou, Eric>So then why will be the stock access
return at X?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5330-0
00:51:02.373 --> 00:51:04.573
<v Hou, Eric>You have three factors.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5335-0
00:51:05.373 --> 00:51:08.413
<v Hou, Eric>You still run this model and you can see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5351-0
00:51:09.973 --> 00:51:13.613
<v Hou, Eric>That you have the coefficient associated
with the market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5361-0
00:51:13.853 --> 00:51:16.613
<v Hou, Eric>You have a coefficient associated with
small minus big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5368-0
00:51:16.813 --> 00:51:20.253
<v Hou, Eric>You have coefficient associated with high
minus low.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5374-0
00:51:21.013 --> 00:51:23.653
<v Hou, Eric>One thing,
if you guys still remember the pee value.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5384-0
00:51:24.483 --> 00:51:26.883
<v Hou, Eric>So 1.0697.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5419-0
00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:32.172
<v Hou, Eric>The P value is 000,
so this number showing that this beta is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5419-1
00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:37.027
<v Hou, Eric>statistically significant,
very significant and somewh.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5419-2
00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:43.529
<v Hou, Eric>One of you mentioned that we need to
check the R square you know for a Cam</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5419-3
00:51:43.529 --> 00:51:47.083
<v Hou, Eric>model, the R square is points 46 or .449.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5425-0
00:51:47.243 --> 00:51:49.603
<v Hou, Eric>459 So basically .46.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5434-0
00:51:50.413 --> 00:51:52.693
<v Hou, Eric>So this is R square of this Cam model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5437-0
00:51:53.293 --> 00:51:54.813
<v Hou, Eric>So remember this number one point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5450-0
00:51:55.483 --> 00:52:01.763
<v Hou, Eric>0697 so then in the 30,
sorry in the three factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5454-0
00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:10.563
<v Hou, Eric>So that in the three factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5476-0
00:52:12.133 --> 00:52:19.173
<v Hou, Eric>The beta associated with market access is
not 1.0697, it's actually higher.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5481-0
00:52:19.413 --> 00:52:22.613
<v Hou, Eric>It's actually going to be 1.11082.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5491-0
00:52:25.013 --> 00:52:28.053
<v Hou, Eric>Right. As you can see,
the coefficient is very significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5503-0
00:52:29.693 --> 00:52:33.773
<v Hou, Eric>And this small minus peak is minus .2842.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5505-0
00:52:34.013 --> 00:52:35.293
<v Hou, Eric>It's a minus number.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5510-0
00:52:35.493 --> 00:52:38.653
<v Hou, Eric>Can someone tell me why in your opinion?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5512-0
00:52:38.653 --> 00:52:40.213
<v Hou, Eric>Why this small minus B?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5523-0
00:52:41.453 --> 00:52:44.213
<v Hou, Eric>The coefficient should be negative
instead of positive.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5526-0
00:52:44.613 --> 00:52:47.173
<v Hou, Eric>Do you know why it should be?
It should be negative.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5541-0
00:52:49.033 --> 00:52:53.603
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Because we're deducting a larger number
from a smaller number,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5541-1
00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:55.633
<v Haroon, Sufyan>so it it should be negative.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5548-0
00:52:59.283 --> 00:53:01.523
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think do you think Apple is?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5553-0
00:53:01.523 --> 00:53:04.243
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think Apple is a big company or
small company?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5555-0
00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:09.363
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Like company.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5578-0
00:53:09.683 --> 00:53:13.242
<v Hou, Eric>So yes,
so then so so Apple should be correlated</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5578-1
00:53:13.242 --> 00:53:17.963
<v Hou, Eric>to this because this is showing that
small is outperforming big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5584-0
00:53:17.963 --> 00:53:19.723
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why it should be negative.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5588-0
00:53:19.923 --> 00:53:21.963
<v Hou, Eric>And it's very, very significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5602-0
00:53:22.323 --> 00:53:27.486
<v Hou, Eric>It's a high book value versus book value
versus market value is also negative.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5602-1
00:53:27.486 --> 00:53:28.923
<v Hou, Eric>It's very significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5617-0
00:53:28.923 --> 00:53:33.791
<v Hou, Eric>As for R square,
both R square and and adjusted R square</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5617-1
00:53:33.791 --> 00:53:35.243
<v Hou, Eric>as applying 5051.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5620-0
00:53:36.053 --> 00:53:38.213
<v Hou, Eric>Outperform the Cam model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5626-0
00:53:38.893 --> 00:53:42.213
<v Hou, Eric>Which is .46 OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5629-0
00:53:45.243 --> 00:53:47.123
<v Hou, Eric>Let's change it to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5642-0
00:53:48.693 --> 00:53:53.013
<v Hou, Eric>A stock to NVIDIA because we were using
NVIDIA as an example before, right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5648-0
00:53:53.013 --> 00:53:54.733
<v Hou, Eric>So they should change the stock into
NVIDIA.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5660-0
00:53:55.493 --> 00:53:59.613
<v Hou, Eric>So then we see that is a 1.6352.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5664-0
00:54:01.333 --> 00:54:01.973
<v Hou, Eric>As for the beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5669-0
00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.293
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try this three factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5687-0
00:54:07.053 --> 00:54:12.705
<v Hou, Eric>So As for NVIDIA,
the R-squared also higher before it was .</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5687-1
00:54:12.705 --> 00:54:12.893
<v Hou, Eric>4.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5691-0
00:54:13.253 --> 00:54:15.493
<v Hou, Eric>Now it's .464.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5701-0
00:54:15.763 --> 00:54:22.003
<v Hou, Eric>46.4% and and one thing that is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5713-0
00:54:23.573 --> 00:54:27.053
<v Hou, Eric>Counterintuitive is s -, B,
as I will imagine.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5721-0
00:54:27.053 --> 00:54:30.533
<v Hou, Eric>Video is a big company,
Big Market cap company.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5727-0
00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:33.613
<v Hou, Eric>But it's positively correlated to this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5731-0
00:54:35.213 --> 00:54:36.373
<v Hou, Eric>As small minus big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5757-0
00:54:37.973 --> 00:54:41.015
<v Hou, Eric>The thing I think is also
counterintuitive is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5757-1
00:54:41.015 --> 00:54:44.833
<v Hou, Eric>See this coefficient and this P value
showing this is .32.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5757-2
00:54:44.833 --> 00:54:48.133
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one example showing that you
know what.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5766-0
00:54:49.813 --> 00:54:53.573
<v Hou, Eric>This NVIDIA is not quite following the
three factor model at least.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5782-0
00:54:53.923 --> 00:55:00.763
<v Hou, Eric>This small minus B factor is not
significant for NVIDIA, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5790-0
00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:04.163
<v Hou, Eric>So high book value versus market value
still coefficient.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5802-0
00:55:04.163 --> 00:55:08.541
<v Hou, Eric>This one is still significant market
access still significant,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5802-1
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:11.043
<v Hou, Eric>but not necessarily small minus big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5807-0
00:55:12.573 --> 00:55:13.933
<v Hou, Eric>Anyone has any reason why it is not?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5818-0
00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:32.843
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Because Nvidia's outperforming the small
market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5831-0
00:55:37.483 --> 00:55:41.123
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, but why isn't it significant now?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5858-0
00:55:41.123 --> 00:55:44.513
<v Hou, Eric>Because it is not significant,
showing that you know, yes,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5858-1
00:55:44.513 --> 00:55:48.535
<v Hou, Eric>maybe it's outperforming this one,
but you know this one may not even</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5858-2
00:55:48.535 --> 00:55:50.603
<v Hou, Eric>explain what NVIDIA performance was.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5859-0
00:55:50.963 --> 00:55:52.003
<v Hou, Eric>So why do Patrick?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5871-0
00:55:52.003 --> 00:55:56.723
<v Hou, Eric>Why do you think it is even not
explainable using this small man speak?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5874-0
00:56:04.603 --> 00:56:05.283
<v Hou, Eric>Any thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5883-0
00:56:05.283 --> 00:56:07.123
<v Hou, Eric>Any gas, any gas.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5885-0
00:56:06.083 --> 00:56:06.603
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I don't know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5892-0
00:56:06.883 --> 00:56:10.563
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>I'll yeah, 'cause. It's not a small,
small company.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5893-0
00:56:10.293 --> 00:56:11.493
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely not small.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5896-0
00:56:13.243 --> 00:56:13.283
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5904-0
00:56:13.283 --> 00:56:16.003
<v Hou, Eric>I was back at this coefficient to be
inactive honestly.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5912-0
00:56:21.943 --> 00:56:23.543
<v Hou, Eric>It will be just a timing issue.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5923-0
00:56:23.543 --> 00:56:27.663
<v Hou, Eric>It could be just because we didn't
consider AI as a factor, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5933-0
00:56:27.663 --> 00:56:30.423
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you add AI as a factor,
this coefficient could be inactive.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5938-0
00:56:30.663 --> 00:56:31.783
<v Hou, Eric>So this could be.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5969-0
00:56:31.983 --> 00:56:36.352
<v Hou, Eric>It could be something we can explore and
why it's happening,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5969-1
00:56:36.352 --> 00:56:41.724
<v Hou, Eric>so this could be like 111 topic we can
explore and then see how this AI is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5969-2
00:56:41.724 --> 00:56:47.023
<v Hou, Eric>affecting those companies such as NVIDIA
in addition to some traditional.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5989-0
00:56:47.813 --> 00:56:51.172
<v Hou, Eric>Conventional financial theories,
so this could be one example that if you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5989-1
00:56:51.172 --> 00:56:52.533
<v Hou, Eric>guys want to write some quick.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5996-0
00:56:53.283 --> 00:56:55.163
<v Hou, Eric>A paper and then this one could be on
topic.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/5998-0
00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:57.173
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6023-0
00:56:57.373 --> 00:57:02.227
<v Teske, Benjamin>There's Quran for like a company being
small versus big like is it comparing it</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6004-0
00:56:57.443 --> 00:56:58.003
<v Hou, Eric>But anyways.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6023-1
00:57:02.227 --> 00:57:04.653
<v Teske, Benjamin>to all the companies in the database or?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6031-0
00:57:04.663 --> 00:57:06.863
<v Hou, Eric>So they they create and they created.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6034-0
00:57:06.863 --> 00:57:08.863
<v Hou, Eric>So actually how they create this is?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6053-0
00:57:10.533 --> 00:57:16.086
<v Hou, Eric>They created 10 buckets and they put the
stocks into 10 buckets and then then then</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6053-1
00:57:16.086 --> 00:57:18.093
<v Hou, Eric>in the year end they sword by.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6063-0
00:57:18.093 --> 00:57:21.893
<v Hou, Eric>So then basically you can consider ban as
as a temp portfolios, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6078-0
00:57:21.893 --> 00:57:27.401
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have 10 portfolios you in the
end of year you sort them by their</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6078-1
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:27.973
<v Hou, Eric>returns.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6086-0
00:57:27.973 --> 00:57:30.213
<v Hou, Eric>So they're gonna,
you're gonna have the the worst one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6090-0
00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.973
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna have the best one,
and guess what?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6104-0
00:57:33.523 --> 00:57:37.203
<v Hou, Eric>They they they do the delta between the
past one and worst one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6106-0
00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:38.203
<v Hou, Eric>So then that will be.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6116-0
00:57:39.813 --> 00:57:41.853
<v Hou, Eric>You know the delta of the returns, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6143-0
00:57:41.853 --> 00:57:45.786
<v Hou, Eric>So then that will be a positive number
because you're using the best 1 minus</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6143-1
00:57:45.786 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Hou, Eric>worst one.
So you are gonna the one thing that is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6143-2
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.893
<v Hou, Eric>same to those two buckets,
that is market access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6159-0
00:57:50.893 --> 00:57:54.404
<v Hou, Eric>So the market access is going to be
factor explaining this,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6159-1
00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.973
<v Hou, Eric>but it going to be subtracted.
So another factor will be OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6166-0
00:57:57.973 --> 00:57:59.893
<v Hou, Eric>What's the difference between those two
buckets?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6176-0
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.217
<v Hou, Eric>So then that will be what's the market
size,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6176-1
00:58:02.217 --> 00:58:04.333
<v Hou, Eric>the market capital size of the first one?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6189-0
00:58:04.603 --> 00:58:08.683
<v Hou, Eric>And the market capital size of the lock
last one, which is the worst one?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6205-0
00:58:08.843 --> 00:58:13.679
<v Hou, Eric>So then you do the delta between the
market capital size and also the book to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6205-1
00:58:13.679 --> 00:58:15.043
<v Hou, Eric>book to market ratios.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6223-0
00:58:15.163 --> 00:58:17.577
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so the Eugene Pharma and the French</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6223-1
00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:21.492
<v Hou, Eric>believe those two factors should explain
the delta in terms of the, the,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6223-2
00:58:21.492 --> 00:58:22.403
<v Hou, Eric>the return delta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6234-0
00:58:22.603 --> 00:58:26.923
<v Hou, Eric>So they run a regression and you found it
was actually true.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6246-0
00:58:27.043 --> 00:58:31.323
<v Hou, Eric>So then that was the reason they created
this three factor 3 factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6254-0
00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:34.053
<v Hou, Eric>So to answer your question,
what is small minds big?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6258-0
00:58:34.053 --> 00:58:35.573
<v Hou, Eric>So then the small mind is big to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6290-0
00:58:35.963 --> 00:58:42.898
<v Hou, Eric>It could be two different portfolios of
small capital, small market cap,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6290-1
00:58:42.898 --> 00:58:50.213
<v Hou, Eric>small market cap stocks as a portfolio
versus another large market cap stock</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6290-2
00:58:50.213 --> 00:58:51.163
<v Hou, Eric>portfolio.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6302-0
00:58:51.203 --> 00:58:55.025
<v Hou, Eric>So then they they track the delta between
those two and then you use that as a</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6302-1
00:58:55.025 --> 00:58:55.363
<v Hou, Eric>factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6306-0
00:58:58.563 --> 00:58:59.563
<v Teske, Benjamin>That makes sense. Thanks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6307-0
00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:00.363
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6318-0
00:59:02.583 --> 00:59:06.198
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
so for NVIDIA it's definitely not quite</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6318-1
00:59:06.198 --> 00:59:07.183
<v Hou, Eric>significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6338-0
00:59:07.183 --> 00:59:11.653
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's just do the comparison
right in terms of accuracy and let's do</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6338-1
00:59:11.653 --> 00:59:13.743
<v Hou, Eric>use NVIDIA. So. So how do I do that?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6354-0
00:59:13.743 --> 00:59:18.694
<v Hou, Eric>How do I actually verify what model works
and that works better than other one as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6354-1
00:59:18.694 --> 00:59:20.263
<v Hou, Eric>you guys suggested, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6372-0
00:59:20.263 --> 00:59:25.152
<v Hou, Eric>So that I need to compare my prediction,
my prediction versus the the actuals,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6372-1
00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:26.823
<v Hou, Eric>so that this is what I did.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6377-0
00:59:27.613 --> 00:59:28.653
<v Hou, Eric>I split.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6380-0
00:59:28.933 --> 00:59:31.373
<v Hou, Eric>I split my data by.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6395-0
00:59:32.043 --> 00:59:35.723
<v Hou, Eric>Quote UN quote trained data and quote UN
quote test data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6403-0
00:59:36.683 --> 00:59:40.043
<v Hou, Eric>I consider any data before 20/22.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6415-0
00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:47.159
<v Hou, Eric>January 1st is the train data and use
that to train my model and I will use the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6415-1
00:59:47.159 --> 00:59:47.603
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6433-0
00:59:49.453 --> 00:59:55.689
<v Hou, Eric>Later than 2020 to January 1st,
as my task as my ground truth to compare</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6433-1
00:59:55.689 --> 00:59:57.653
<v Hou, Eric>against my predictions.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6451-0
00:59:59.403 --> 01:00:03.763
<v Hou, Eric>So what I do is I split the train and
translate in in this way.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6460-0
01:00:04.523 --> 01:00:08.603
<v Hou, Eric>Now let me just run cab model based upon
the training data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6493-0
01:00:09.483 --> 01:00:15.038
<v Hou, Eric>So based on the training I have this 1.
4805 as my delta as my beta and this beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6493-1
01:00:15.038 --> 01:00:20.392
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see is actually lower than
this because they are training based upon</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6493-2
01:00:20.392 --> 01:00:23.203
<v Hou, Eric>different timing and based different data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6495-0
01:00:23.723 --> 01:00:25.483
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm going to compare.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6514-0
01:00:26.763 --> 01:00:30.750
<v Hou, Eric>What's my prediction for the testing
period,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6514-1
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:35.003
<v Hou, Eric>which is anytime after 2022 to the end of
2024?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6535-0
01:00:38.003 --> 01:00:45.843
<v Hou, Eric>So my me and absolute error is .18,
so it's quite big, quite high.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6574-0
01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Hou, Eric>So that's already like one 84184 basis
point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6574-1
01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.619
<v Hou, Eric>But as you can see this is really my
prediction daily return versus actual</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6574-2
01:00:54.619 --> 01:01:00.639
<v Hou, Eric>from what you can actually visualize this
Cam model is not performing well because</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6574-3
01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:04.483
<v Hou, Eric>there are some big spikes like this big
spikes like.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6581-0
01:01:04.483 --> 01:01:07.043
<v Hou, Eric>This or big steeps like this, there's no.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6602-0
01:01:07.633 --> 01:01:12.743
<v Hou, Eric>Prediction because you can see the
prediction of the daily returns quite</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6602-1
01:01:12.743 --> 01:01:17.713
<v Hou, Eric>centralized to this this average,
which is like slightly below than 0.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6618-0
01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:24.379
<v Hou, Eric>So that can tell you why is not so
accurate and you can calculate</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6618-1
01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:25.923
<v Hou, Eric>accumulative return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6625-0
01:01:28.683 --> 01:01:30.603
<v Hou, Eric>And you can certainly see that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6629-0
01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:32.763
<v Hou, Eric>This CAD model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6664-0
01:01:34.643 --> 01:01:39.764
<v Hou, Eric>Under under estimate the video a lot.
If you invest in video,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6664-1
01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:45.545
<v Hou, Eric>you should be enjoying like five times
return. But for the Cam model,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6664-2
01:01:45.545 --> 01:01:51.243
<v Hou, Eric>it's basically suggesting you know what 1.
440% return as a maximum.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6673-0
01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:56.443
<v Hou, Eric>That shows that you know this Cam model
is not quite accurate for NVIDIA.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6675-0
01:01:57.913 --> 01:01:58.473
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6684-0
01:02:00.123 --> 01:02:01.923
<v Hou, Eric>Even though 01 point 35 right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6696-0
01:02:01.923 --> 01:02:09.003
<v Hou, Eric>So however, the actual is 4.7 X.
Let's see the 3X at three factor models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6699-0
01:02:10.763 --> 01:02:11.403
<v Hou, Eric>The same strategy.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6715-0
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:17.843
<v Hou, Eric>We use the train data to estimate the
beta for the marketed access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6730-0
01:02:17.843 --> 01:02:22.963
<v Hou, Eric>Return the beta for small minus big.
The beta associated with high minus low.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6735-0
01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:27.403
<v Hou, Eric>So now we still have the different
numbers, but now in this case C.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6742-0
01:02:28.553 --> 01:02:31.273
<v Hou, Eric>Those three factors 3 beta are
significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6784-0
01:02:33.043 --> 01:02:39.142
<v Hou, Eric>So back to the question I asked you guys.
It may actually going to be a timing</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6784-1
01:02:39.142 --> 01:02:45.086
<v Hou, Eric>issue that someone mentioned when we
discussed why Cam model is not accurate</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6784-2
01:02:45.086 --> 01:02:49.255
<v Hou, Eric>because AI is a thing recently happened
before 20/22,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6784-3
01:02:49.255 --> 01:02:52.883
<v Hou, Eric>it was not affecting the stock price or
stock.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6792-0
01:02:52.883 --> 01:02:57.203
<v Hou, Eric>Return that significantly,
so if you train.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6820-0
01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:02.098
<v Hou, Eric>I think that if you train a three factor
model across all the data that we have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6820-1
01:03:02.098 --> 01:03:05.393
<v Hou, Eric>through end of 24 this moment as big is
not significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6840-0
01:03:05.393 --> 01:03:11.485
<v Hou, Eric>So then this AI aiai concept is affecting
those three factor models,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6840-1
01:03:11.485 --> 01:03:15.193
<v Hou, Eric>but if you only use the data before 20/22.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6846-0
01:03:16.803 --> 01:03:17.963
<v Hou, Eric>Since no AI before that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6858-0
01:03:19.683 --> 01:03:24.083
<v Hou, Eric>Well, some, but not as significant.
You know this model working very well.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6864-0
01:03:25.763 --> 01:03:27.283
<v Hou, Eric>As for the P value perspective.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6866-0
01:03:27.893 --> 01:03:28.773
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6884-0
01:03:31.123 --> 01:03:38.083
<v Hou, Eric>From this so then this is it's only a 165
as a mean average error.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6887-0
01:03:38.403 --> 01:03:40.003
<v Hou, Eric>So if you remember Cam model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6894-0
01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:42.923
<v Hou, Eric>That error is 184.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6917-0
01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:48.267
<v Hou, Eric>So then yes, it's not perfect,
but it's better than the cap already and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6917-1
01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:54.130
<v Hou, Eric>still the issue is the issue is there's
some spies in here and there the model</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6917-2
01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.243
<v Hou, Eric>cannot predict.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6923-0
01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:57.313
<v Hou, Eric>The model can operate.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6924-0
01:03:57.313 --> 01:03:58.793
<v Hou, Eric>Predict 0.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6937-0
01:03:58.953 --> 01:04:05.873
<v Hou, Eric>We'll certainly underestimate the actual
return, so in this case it's even worse.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6954-0
01:04:06.553 --> 01:04:11.472
<v Hou, Eric>So 47 times and then this model only
suggest 10% as maximum return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6954-1
01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:16.753
<v Hou, Eric>You know holding this stuff for two years.
This is basically telling us.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6971-0
01:04:18.323 --> 01:04:22.339
<v Hou, Eric>Currently,
those two models cannot working very well</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6971-1
01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:24.763
<v Hou, Eric>for NVIDIA. I believe it's Matt.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6975-0
01:04:24.763 --> 01:04:26.243
<v Hou, Eric>Did you suggest that we should?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6995-0
01:04:26.513 --> 01:04:30.970
<v Hou, Eric>Add we should add,
you know AI factor in here and then this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/6995-1
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:35.353
<v Hou, Eric>data is actually showing that maybe
that's the right idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7011-0
01:04:36.353 --> 01:04:42.018
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe you should add AI factor here and
estimate how AI is affecting your daily</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7011-1
01:04:42.018 --> 01:04:42.513
<v Hou, Eric>return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7033-0
01:04:43.193 --> 01:04:46.656
<v Hou, Eric>I believe that'll be very significant and
I'll be,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7033-1
01:04:46.656 --> 01:04:51.749
<v Hou, Eric>I believe that AI factor model in
addition either to the Cam model or this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7033-2
01:04:51.749 --> 01:04:54.193
<v Hou, Eric>three factor model gonna outperform.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7037-0
01:04:54.963 --> 01:04:55.923
<v Hou, Eric>The current traditional.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7045-0
01:04:57.243 --> 01:04:59.723
<v Hou, Eric>Three factor models and can model and.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7046-0
01:04:59.723 --> 01:04:59.963
<v Hou, Eric>This is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7056-0
01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:04.342
<v Hou, Eric>The actual data is suggesting that OK,
you can actually use this to write an</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7056-1
01:05:04.342 --> 01:05:04.683
<v Hou, Eric>essay.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7061-0
01:05:04.953 --> 01:05:08.233
<v Hou, Eric>To write on paper, by the way,
any questions?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7066-0
01:05:14.903 --> 01:05:17.183
<v Benbenek, MATT>How would you account for AI?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7076-0
01:05:18.933 --> 01:05:21.173
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, how do I account for AIA?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7082-0
01:05:21.733 --> 01:05:27.573
<v Hou, Eric>Really simple idea is you can add a flag
in your data. Let me show you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7112-0
01:05:32.023 --> 01:05:39.335
<v Hou, Eric>So now we have the regressor that NVIDIA
NVIDIA return over this and this and this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7112-1
01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:44.974
<v Hou, Eric>right AI was not a thing,
was not a concept that existing human</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7112-2
01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.383
<v Hou, Eric>life since 2010.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7127-0
01:05:46.783 --> 01:05:51.889
<v Hou, Eric>You can actually add a simple flag,
let's call it AI flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7127-1
01:05:51.889 --> 01:05:55.263
<v Hou, Eric>This flag has two values, zero and one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7137-0
01:05:56.963 --> 01:06:00.883
<v Hou, Eric>Put the value 0 associated with flag to
the moment that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7180-0
01:06:01.513 --> 01:06:05.945
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
at the year 2023 or the year meal of 2022,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7180-1
01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:12.355
<v Hou, Eric>you believe AI is affecting the the stock
price and then after that date you put</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7180-2
01:06:12.355 --> 01:06:18.132
<v Hou, Eric>all the ones there and and and any
coefficient associated with that one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7180-3
01:06:18.132 --> 01:06:19.873
<v Hou, Eric>I believe going to be.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7196-0
01:06:19.873 --> 01:06:24.646
<v Hou, Eric>A positive number is telling you that how
AI is affecting this. You know what?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7196-1
01:06:24.646 --> 01:06:25.793
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just do this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7198-0
01:06:28.353 --> 01:06:29.073
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7204-0
01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.853
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see if it helps.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7215-0
01:06:54.453 --> 01:06:56.613
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And let me ask you a question.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7236-0
01:06:56.613 --> 01:07:01.267
<v Hou, Eric>What day do you believe AI is affecting?
AI is affecting stock price?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7236-1
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:05.390
<v Hou, Eric>Any arbitrary date?
We're gonna put this flag and the term is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7236-2
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.453
<v Hou, Eric>flag equal to 1.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7237-0
01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:07.973
<v Hou, Eric>Any thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7239-0
01:07:08.533 --> 01:07:09.373
<v Hou, Eric>Any preference?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7243-0
01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:17.973
<v Benbenek, MATT>Maybe like 2023?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7249-0
01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:25.393
<v Hou, Eric>One, let's do this. Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7247-0
01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:23.273
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7252-0
01:07:27.233 --> 01:07:28.833
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do this, OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7254-0
01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:31.723
<v Hou, Eric>I had a code.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7256-0
01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.203
<v Hou, Eric>Say OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7265-0
01:07:39.763 --> 01:07:41.243
<v Hou, Eric>I do have a AI flag right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7272-0
01:07:41.243 --> 01:07:42.803
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me show you I'm not cheating.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7280-0
01:07:42.803 --> 01:07:47.003
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just add a sorry add a
where clause here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7285-0
01:08:00.063 --> 01:08:01.623
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say 2022.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7287-0
01:08:03.123 --> 01:08:03.443
<v Hou, Eric>12:30.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7289-0
01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:05.163
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7294-0
01:08:07.053 --> 01:08:08.573
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so 12:30.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7315-0
01:08:10.123 --> 01:08:15.709
<v Hou, Eric>This flag still 0 after 12:30,
the first trading day is already one. OK,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7315-1
01:08:15.709 --> 01:08:17.163
<v Hou, Eric>so I'm not trading.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7326-0
01:08:17.163 --> 01:08:22.403
<v Hou, Eric>So then this one becomes one after a
certain date since 23 OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7330-0
01:08:22.403 --> 01:08:24.003
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's do this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7335-0
01:08:25.123 --> 01:08:26.363
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do this camp.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7339-0
01:08:26.843 --> 01:08:29.283
<v Hou, Eric>But it's it. Don't be enhanced a camp.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7345-0
01:08:31.163 --> 01:08:32.403
<v Hou, Eric>Just copy the data here and here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7356-0
01:08:36.913 --> 01:08:43.369
<v Hou, Eric>OK, still NVIDIA now.
Still stock access return and here is not</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7356-1
01:08:43.369 --> 01:08:43.873
<v Hou, Eric>only.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7361-0
01:08:45.443 --> 01:08:47.603
<v Hou, Eric>Not only this market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7364-0
01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:49.843
<v Hou, Eric>But this AI flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7368-0
01:08:53.043 --> 01:08:55.163
<v Hou, Eric>Not flash flag. Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7371-0
01:08:57.993 --> 01:08:59.033
<v Hou, Eric>I call you a flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7373-0
01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:00.353
<v Hou, Eric>Black. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7377-0
01:09:03.763 --> 01:09:05.563
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, let's see how it works.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7401-0
01:09:11.893 --> 01:09:18.082
<v Hou, Eric>Yep, as you can see,
this AI flag is driving 36 basis points</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7401-1
01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:23.256
<v Hou, Eric>return overall, right overall.
And as you can see,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7401-2
01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:27.213
<v Hou, Eric>it's quite significant, but that's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7404-0
01:09:31.353 --> 01:09:32.593
<v Hou, Eric>If we have a three factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7427-0
01:09:56.753 --> 01:10:05.007
<v Hou, Eric>I see the A the first three factor models.
OK AEI flag is is very significant again</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7427-1
01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:05.793
<v Hou, Eric>however.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7441-0
01:10:07.933 --> 01:10:13.773
<v Hou, Eric>It still make the the new model still SMB
not quite significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7459-0
01:10:14.773 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Hou, Eric>Not quite significant,
so still not perfect,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7459-1
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.533
<v Hou, Eric>but let's try a test and and and and
return a test and train and test.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7471-0
01:10:34.483 --> 01:10:38.485
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
but in this case our train cannot be</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7471-1
01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:39.363
<v Hou, Eric>20/22/01.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7478-0
01:10:40.263 --> 01:10:44.023
<v Hou, Eric>Do you know the reason why we cannot do
20/22/01 in this case?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7489-0
01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:53.863
<v Hou, Eric>We have to change this this one to 2024.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7507-0
01:10:55.403 --> 01:11:02.523
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is we say this AI flag started
from 2023, January the 1st.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7550-0
01:11:02.523 --> 01:11:08.566
<v Hou, Eric>We need some data in the train data to
for the model to understand how big this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7550-1
01:11:08.566 --> 01:11:12.418
<v Hou, Eric>AI flag is.
If the model didn't see the AI flag as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7550-2
01:11:12.418 --> 01:11:17.782
<v Hou, Eric>information in the train data.
So the model does not know this AI flag</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7550-3
01:11:17.782 --> 01:11:19.443
<v Hou, Eric>as as a new indicator.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7576-0
01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:25.543
<v Hou, Eric>There's only zero values for the model to
learn in the training piece,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7576-1
01:11:25.543 --> 01:11:31.406
<v Hou, Eric>so then the model could not understand
how big this AI flag is in terms of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7576-2
01:11:31.406 --> 01:11:31.953
<v Hou, Eric>impact.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7585-0
01:11:32.233 --> 01:11:36.833
<v Hou, Eric>So let's change the train has speed as 24.
So let's do this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7598-0
01:11:39.393 --> 01:11:45.062
<v Hou, Eric>That's as a comparison.
We still keep the original original Cam</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7598-1
01:11:45.062 --> 01:11:45.593
<v Hou, Eric>model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7603-0
01:11:47.283 --> 01:11:49.963
<v Hou, Eric>And it was this so last data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7605-0
01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:52.243
<v Hou, Eric>Accumulative.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7608-0
01:11:53.923 --> 01:11:54.803
<v Hou, Eric>Still underperformed.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7627-0
01:11:56.523 --> 01:12:02.495
<v Hou, Eric>Right still underperformed,
so that it should be 2.86 and sell 1.44 X.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7627-1
01:12:02.495 --> 01:12:03.083
<v Hou, Eric>So now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7629-0
01:12:04.723 --> 01:12:05.163
<v Hou, Eric>Let's add.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7631-0
01:12:07.353 --> 01:12:07.553
<v Hou, Eric>Umm.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7634-0
01:12:09.073 --> 01:12:10.473
<v Hou, Eric>On this one, sorry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7640-0
01:12:11.743 --> 01:12:14.543
<v Hou, Eric>Let's add AI flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7643-0
01:12:15.343 --> 01:12:17.383
<v Hou, Eric>Let's have AI flag in consideration.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7645-0
01:12:25.143 --> 01:12:25.583
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7660-0
01:12:26.263 --> 01:12:30.116
<v Hou, Eric>So we have this market minus this this
number and AI flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7660-1
01:12:30.116 --> 01:12:32.663
<v Hou, Eric>This number both are quite significant.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7662-0
01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:35.483
<v Hou, Eric>Let's compute.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7664-0
01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:45.803
<v Hou, Eric>O now.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7666-0
01:12:48.043 --> 01:12:48.443
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7684-0
01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:01.959
<v Hou, Eric>So now we can not only do market access
return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7684-1
01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:04.573
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have to do this AI flag.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7694-0
01:13:06.443 --> 01:13:10.963
<v Hou, Eric>Get this this so then this parameter
gonna have two values.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7710-0
01:13:15.623 --> 01:13:20.771
<v Hou, Eric>AI flag so that will be our white task
that will be our white red and let's see</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7710-1
01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:21.543
<v Hou, Eric>how it goes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7712-0
01:13:24.713 --> 01:13:24.993
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7719-0
01:13:26.633 --> 01:13:32.513
<v Hou, Eric>So absolute Mae is .02 and before.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7727-0
01:13:34.083 --> 01:13:38.083
<v Hou, Eric>Is .0204 and this one is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7734-0
01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:42.363
<v Hou, Eric>.023 OK, slightly helpful.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7736-0
01:13:44.723 --> 01:13:45.643
<v Hou, Eric>Helpful a little bit.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7746-0
01:13:52.153 --> 01:13:56.563
<v Hou, Eric>And cumulative,
I think it would be better than previous</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7746-1
01:13:56.563 --> 01:13:58.033
<v Hou, Eric>model. Oh wow. See.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7767-0
01:14:02.793 --> 01:14:08.552
<v Hou, Eric>I think this much better model in terms
of cumulative cumulative return,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7767-1
01:14:08.552 --> 01:14:11.313
<v Hou, Eric>right compared to the original Cam.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7770-0
01:14:13.633 --> 01:14:14.713
<v Hou, Eric>Do you agree, Matt?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7778-0
01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.753
<v Benbenek, MATT>I agree. Thanks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7775-0
01:14:18.473 --> 01:14:18.833
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7787-0
01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.633
<v Hou, Eric>So it's adding one single one single
factor.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7790-0
01:14:21.633 --> 01:14:22.713
<v Hou, Eric>So now it's better.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7797-0
01:14:23.153 --> 01:14:26.633
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, but honestly,
it could be too too good to be true.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7799-0
01:14:29.593 --> 01:14:29.633
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7814-0
01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:32.128
<v Hou, Eric>I mean you catch up basically saying
you're gonna you're gonna,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7814-1
01:14:32.128 --> 01:14:34.193
<v Hou, Eric>you're gonna reach the sky,
and the Sky's the limit.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7822-0
01:14:34.993 --> 01:14:37.273
<v Hou, Eric>But what happened today is not suggesting
that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7847-0
01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:39.960
<v Hou, Eric>But you know,
but definitely you can try the three</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7847-1
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.070
<v Hou, Eric>factor model after class and then I'm
pretty sure I can guarantee that you're</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7847-2
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:47.073
<v Hou, Eric>gonna be out performing the current three
factor models.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7848-0
01:14:47.433 --> 01:14:49.153
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7853-0
01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:52.673
<v Hou, Eric>Any question around Cam Model 3 factor
models?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7871-0
01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:03.993
<v Haroon, Sufyan>You share the GitHub Rep all right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7863-0
01:15:01.533 --> 01:15:01.933
<v Hou, Eric>I I will.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7882-0
01:15:01.933 --> 01:15:06.124
<v Hou, Eric>I will upload to the to the D2L so that
you you have all you have the data and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7882-1
01:15:06.124 --> 01:15:09.253
<v Hou, Eric>then you have these jubilant notebook to
play around with.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7885-0
01:15:10.243 --> 01:15:10.643
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Sounds good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7887-0
01:15:10.643 --> 01:15:11.163
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Thank you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7889-0
01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:11.693
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7891-0
01:15:17.243 --> 01:15:18.163
<v Hou, Eric>Any other thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7895-0
01:15:22.673 --> 01:15:23.353
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7901-0
01:15:23.513 --> 01:15:26.753
<v Hou, Eric>So let's take a 15 minute break.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7907-0
01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.163
<v Hou, Eric>Let's come back, let's say 7.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7914-0
01:15:31.763 --> 01:15:32.843
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say 7:15.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7916-0
01:15:32.843 --> 01:15:33.803
<v Hou, Eric>Is that OK folks?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7926-0
01:15:36.503 --> 01:15:38.343
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Good. Sounds good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7922-0
01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:37.863
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>Sounds good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7924-0
01:15:37.303 --> 01:15:37.903
<v Severin, Noah>Yeah, sounds good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7939-0
01:15:37.503 --> 01:15:42.143
<v Hou, Eric>Alright,
I'll see you guys in in in 15 minutes, OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7974-0
01:15:42.143 --> 01:15:46.360
<v Hou, Eric>So then we gonna talk about another
another thing called clustering analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7974-1
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.468
<v Hou, Eric>As unsupervised machine learning.
And we're gonna see whether or not we can</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7974-2
01:15:50.468 --> 01:15:54.143
<v Hou, Eric>predict whether or not a company gonna
gonna broke or bankrupt. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/7982-0
01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.583
<v Hou, Eric>I'll see you guys in 15 minutes. Yeah,
50 minutes. Bye.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8171-0
01:32:02.223 --> 01:32:05.023
<v Hou, Eric>Alright, let's get back to our class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8173-0
01:32:06.913 --> 01:32:07.393
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8182-0
01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.443
<v Hou, Eric>Just to double check, you guys can see,
you hear me, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8187-0
01:32:14.033 --> 01:32:14.553
<v Severin, Noah>Yes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8186-0
01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:14.943
<v Carone, Matt>Yep.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8189-0
01:32:15.443 --> 01:32:16.603
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect. Perfect.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8193-0
01:32:18.363 --> 01:32:19.083
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8199-0
01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:19.963
<v Hou, Eric>It's recorded.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8203-0
01:32:21.243 --> 01:32:24.843
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, stop recording. OK,
so it's still recording. That's awesome.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8214-0
01:32:27.283 --> 01:32:31.306
<v Hou, Eric>UN supervised mature learning. OK,
so there are actually two types of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8214-1
01:32:31.306 --> 01:32:32.283
<v Hou, Eric>machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8224-0
01:32:34.523 --> 01:32:38.203
<v Hou, Eric>SO11 kind of type is a supervised machine
learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8234-0
01:32:38.873 --> 01:32:41.713
<v Hou, Eric>Another one that unsupervised machine
learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8241-0
01:32:41.713 --> 01:32:42.633
<v Hou, Eric>So I'll supervise machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8286-0
01:32:43.113 --> 01:32:48.833
<v Hou, Eric>Are the models like the linear regression
model that we just touch based and then</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8286-1
01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:53.996
<v Hou, Eric>and then for example the the tree models
are supervised machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8286-2
01:32:53.996 --> 01:32:58.948
<v Hou, Eric>The neural networks are supervised
machine learning and even the large</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8286-3
01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:03.273
<v Hou, Eric>ranked models are sort of supervised
machine learning, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8293-0
01:33:03.273 --> 01:33:05.753
<v Hou, Eric>So then, for example,
if you you you drive a Tesla.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8302-0
01:33:06.563 --> 01:33:09.363
<v Hou, Eric>This computer vision model and then you
you know when you download.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8305-0
01:33:11.473 --> 01:33:12.953
<v Hou, Eric>Self drive.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8317-0
01:33:14.563 --> 01:33:17.643
<v Hou, Eric>Package it has supervised in the
princesses, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8336-0
01:33:17.643 --> 01:33:22.692
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know that Tesla is based upon
a supervised machine learning model as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8336-1
01:33:22.692 --> 01:33:23.003
<v Hou, Eric>well.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8340-0
01:33:23.643 --> 01:33:25.163
<v Hou, Eric>So unsupervised machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8352-0
01:33:25.163 --> 01:33:29.323
<v Hou, Eric>So there's still a usage for for the
unsupervised machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8370-0
01:33:29.323 --> 01:33:34.254
<v Hou, Eric>The reason is they can still give you
some insight of of the data that you are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8370-1
01:33:34.254 --> 01:33:39.309
<v Hou, Eric>analyzing and then relatively running the
unsupervised machine learning is quite</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8370-2
01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:39.683
<v Hou, Eric>cheap.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8390-0
01:33:41.193 --> 01:33:46.062
<v Hou, Eric>But there is definitely some a lot of
counts of running unsupervised machine</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8390-1
01:33:46.062 --> 01:33:47.073
<v Hou, Eric>learning, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8394-0
01:33:47.073 --> 01:33:49.713
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can definitely explore in this
session.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8402-0
01:33:51.283 --> 01:33:53.403
<v Hou, Eric>So how we are doing that?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8410-0
01:33:53.403 --> 01:33:55.763
<v Hou, Eric>Why we need those unsupervised machine
learning?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8414-0
01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.803
<v Hou, Eric>So it's really solving a problem of.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8418-0
01:33:59.563 --> 01:34:00.123
<v Hou, Eric>How do we?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8435-0
01:34:01.843 --> 01:34:07.843
<v Hou, Eric>Utilize the similarity as as as a as a
feature or as a metric in in the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8446-0
01:34:08.553 --> 01:34:11.553
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then for example,
if your boss ask you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8450-0
01:34:13.443 --> 01:34:14.643
<v Hou, Eric>Can you give me?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8454-0
01:34:16.323 --> 01:34:16.923
<v Hou, Eric>Similar stocks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8462-0
01:34:16.923 --> 01:34:19.323
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can put those similar stocks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8466-0
01:34:19.323 --> 01:34:21.363
<v Hou, Eric>Consider those similar stocks together.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8473-0
01:34:22.253 --> 01:34:24.373
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then that could be A1 request.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8508-0
01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:30.560
<v Hou, Eric>Or you can you say, hey,
can you find some similarity between</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8508-1
01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:34.493
<v Hou, Eric>those companies,
not just bankrupted in the last ten and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8508-2
01:34:34.493 --> 01:34:39.942
<v Hou, Eric>last decade or or or since COVID do you?
Can you find any reason why they just</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8508-3
01:34:39.942 --> 01:34:40.563
<v Hou, Eric>bankrupt?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8537-0
01:34:42.203 --> 01:34:47.050
<v Hou, Eric>Or can you find that's a good performing
stocks and then you know you your answer</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8537-1
01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:51.602
<v Hou, Eric>could be like there is always like AI
related so then that could be 111 good</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8537-2
01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:52.843
<v Hou, Eric>answer for your boss.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8555-0
01:34:53.353 --> 01:34:57.660
<v Hou, Eric>To your boss so,
so and unsupervised commercial learning</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8555-1
01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:00.833
<v Hou, Eric>is usually the good, very good first step.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8571-0
01:35:02.403 --> 01:35:07.443
<v Hou, Eric>To analyze the similarity around the data
you're trying to analyze. So that's why.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8586-0
01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:12.643
<v Hou, Eric>And what is?
What is unsupervised learning?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8588-0
01:35:12.643 --> 01:35:15.123
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So the unsupervised learning remember.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8630-0
01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:23.062
<v Hou, Eric>When we do the regression model,
as I mentioned is a supervised machine</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8630-1
01:35:23.062 --> 01:35:29.175
<v Hou, Eric>learning and you know clearly there are
some data, some actual data,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8630-2
01:35:29.175 --> 01:35:34.756
<v Hou, Eric>in terms of either.
This is a daily return with a stock price.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8630-3
01:35:34.756 --> 01:35:40.603
<v Hou, Eric>You are developing a model to ensure your
prediction as close as.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8633-0
01:35:40.603 --> 01:35:40.923
<v Hou, Eric>Possible.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8646-0
01:35:41.193 --> 01:35:45.313
<v Hou, Eric>To those ground truth or to those metrics
that you wanna predict it?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8679-0
01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:50.390
<v Hou, Eric>So for example, like daily return,
we're always gonna compare our prediction</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8679-1
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:55.106
<v Hou, Eric>versus the actual daily return from
either NVIDIA or from Apple for whatever</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8679-2
01:35:55.106 --> 01:35:57.433
<v Hou, Eric>stock you're trying to analyze, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8686-0
01:35:57.833 --> 01:36:03.073
<v Hou, Eric>But unsupervised learning there is and
and we call those those those numbers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8700-0
01:36:05.403 --> 01:36:09.326
<v Hou, Eric>Labels,
so unsupervised alerted learning are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8700-1
01:36:09.326 --> 01:36:11.243
<v Hou, Eric>really unlabeled data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8741-0
01:36:13.613 --> 01:36:19.842
<v Hou, Eric>So, so we do not know where is no metric.
We really want to predict or get our</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8741-1
01:36:19.842 --> 01:36:24.494
<v Hou, Eric>matches as close as possible where there
is no such value.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8741-2
01:36:24.494 --> 01:36:29.618
<v Hou, Eric>We just want to analyze is there any
similar behavior or similar</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8741-3
01:36:29.618 --> 01:36:32.693
<v Hou, Eric>characteristics around those data sets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8749-0
01:36:33.173 --> 01:36:37.413
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why it's, you know,
this is really where you can use.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8761-0
01:36:38.203 --> 01:36:41.923
<v Hou, Eric>UN supervised machine learning.
Or you just bundle the data structure?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8770-0
01:36:42.703 --> 01:36:46.183
<v Hou, Eric>So some common tasks could be like the
clustering, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8772-0
01:36:46.183 --> 01:36:47.063
<v Hou, Eric>So you just group.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8802-0
01:36:48.603 --> 01:36:54.357
<v Hou, Eric>Stocks companies together or you can use
unsupervised machine learning to do</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8802-1
01:36:54.357 --> 01:36:58.541
<v Hou, Eric>anomaly detection.
So that could be one derivative of a</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8802-2
01:36:58.541 --> 01:36:59.363
<v Hou, Eric>clustering.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8814-0
01:36:59.363 --> 01:37:03.803
<v Hou, Eric>Sometimes your clustering just give you
hey, I have three groups, 3 buckets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8823-0
01:37:04.403 --> 01:37:10.449
<v Hou, Eric>The first bucket contains 99% of the data
and then the second bucket comes in five</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8823-1
01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:11.323
<v Hou, Eric>data points.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8848-0
01:37:11.913 --> 01:37:15.234
<v Hou, Eric>And the third bucket contains one data
point,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8848-1
01:37:15.234 --> 01:37:19.999
<v Hou, Eric>usually those two buckets are just
anomalies that the the the the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8848-2
01:37:19.999 --> 01:37:23.753
<v Hou, Eric>algorithm's gonna recommend you to get
rid of them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8853-0
01:37:23.753 --> 01:37:25.553
<v Hou, Eric>So then unsupervised machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8895-0
01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:31.344
<v Hou, Eric>Really do have a A use case in detecting
those anomalies and could be like</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8895-1
01:37:31.344 --> 01:37:36.047
<v Hou, Eric>reducing the dimension.
So for example you have so many columns</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8895-2
01:37:36.047 --> 01:37:41.044
<v Hou, Eric>they want to use and then you can
actually use unsupervised machine</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8895-3
01:37:41.044 --> 01:37:42.513
<v Hou, Eric>learning to do that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8904-0
01:37:43.273 --> 01:37:47.873
<v Hou, Eric>But that is not usually recommended.
There's no regulation.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8920-0
01:37:49.443 --> 01:37:54.396
<v Hou, Eric>Method that you can use to to reduce
reduce dimension but not necessarily</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8920-1
01:37:54.396 --> 01:37:56.403
<v Hou, Eric>unsupervised machine learning.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8933-0
01:37:57.153 --> 01:37:59.494
<v Hou, Eric>So, you know,
mines were much supervised machine</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8933-1
01:37:59.494 --> 01:38:01.596
<v Hou, Eric>learning.
The most famous one is really the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8933-2
01:38:01.596 --> 01:38:02.073
<v Hou, Eric>classroom.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8960-0
01:38:04.243 --> 01:38:08.332
<v Hou, Eric>So you in in terms of classroom,
So what we're gonna talk about in this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8960-1
01:38:08.332 --> 01:38:10.603
<v Hou, Eric>class is going to be the K means, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8981-0
01:38:11.083 --> 01:38:18.448
<v Hou, Eric>So the K means is is an algorithm that's
very famous in in clustering analysis and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/8981-1
01:38:18.448 --> 01:38:20.843
<v Hou, Eric>very widely used in in any.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9002-0
01:38:22.433 --> 01:38:27.473
<v Hou, Eric>Analysis say in finance, say it business,
say it for whatever.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9002-1
01:38:27.473 --> 01:38:30.673
<v Hou, Eric>And here's a link that I gonna show you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9009-0
01:38:39.753 --> 01:38:41.073
<v Hou, Eric>I'm gonna show you, OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9012-0
01:38:41.073 --> 01:38:43.153
<v Hou, Eric>So how this algorithm works?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9021-0
01:38:44.713 --> 01:38:46.433
<v Hou, Eric>So this algorithm works in this way.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9026-0
01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:49.793
<v Hou, Eric>So let's say we have let's the say 100.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9044-0
01:38:49.793 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say only have fifty data and then
we gonna only group data into three</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9044-1
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.473
<v Hou, Eric>buckets and then draw.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9055-0
01:39:00.713 --> 01:39:08.913
<v Hou, Eric>So here you start with 50 data points on
this twodimensional plane and then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9057-0
01:39:09.833 --> 01:39:10.153
<v Hou, Eric>Alliance.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9059-0
01:39:21.683 --> 01:39:22.203
<v Hou, Eric>All good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9062-0
01:39:25.173 --> 01:39:25.493
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9075-0
01:39:25.973 --> 01:39:29.118
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see,
we have only three three centres,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9075-1
01:39:29.118 --> 01:39:31.493
<v Hou, Eric>so this is a random data you have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9087-0
01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:37.633
<v Hou, Eric>What you're trying to do is OK,
based upon the divide.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9101-0
01:39:39.993 --> 01:39:45.793
<v Hou, Eric>Dot on this Gray plane.
How can I group them into 3 buckets?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9105-0
01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:47.553
<v Hou, Eric>So that's the question.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9111-0
01:39:47.553 --> 01:39:50.793
<v Hou, Eric>So you can just imagine every single dot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9124-0
01:39:52.473 --> 01:39:55.193
<v Hou, Eric>Is or you.
You can imagine those are just basically</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9124-1
01:39:55.193 --> 01:39:56.553
<v Hou, Eric>like a, a a person, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9144-0
01:39:56.553 --> 01:40:01.869
<v Hou, Eric>So then it could be a weight and and
height of a person and then you want to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9144-1
01:40:01.869 --> 01:40:06.633
<v Hou, Eric>you want to assign different person into
different crews based upon.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9155-0
01:40:07.183 --> 01:40:09.383
<v Hou, Eric>You know the weight and height of the
person.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9171-0
01:40:09.383 --> 01:40:14.799
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can use that data to define
the the the health or healthy status of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9171-1
01:40:14.799 --> 01:40:15.543
<v Hou, Eric>the person.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9182-0
01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:20.863
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then the task is you need to
have three steps, 3 buckets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9194-0
01:40:21.943 --> 01:40:29.623
<v Hou, Eric>So the K means how the K means runs is
among this data I gonna randomly select?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9210-0
01:40:31.193 --> 01:40:38.225
<v Hou, Eric>Three points in this 2D plane,
so the algorithm selects 3 random points</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9210-1
01:40:38.225 --> 01:40:38.713
<v Hou, Eric>here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9246-0
01:40:39.423 --> 01:40:43.473
<v Hou, Eric>The blue one,
the red one and the green one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9246-1
01:40:43.473 --> 01:40:48.963
<v Hou, Eric>Those are random oint.
What I'm going to calculate is I will</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9246-2
01:40:48.963 --> 01:40:55.443
<v Hou, Eric>calculate the distance between,
for example this dot to this blue point</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9246-3
01:40:55.443 --> 01:41:02.103
<v Hou, Eric>and this dot to this red point and this
dot to this green green point so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9249-0
01:41:02.173 --> 01:41:04.533
<v Hou, Eric>And out of those 3 distances.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9259-0
01:41:06.103 --> 01:41:07.423
<v Hou, Eric>There's only one distance.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9263-0
01:41:07.423 --> 01:41:08.823
<v Hou, Eric>That is the shortest one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9279-0
01:41:11.143 --> 01:41:15.107
<v Hou, Eric>From this example,
this blue one is the shortest distance</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9279-1
01:41:15.107 --> 01:41:16.063
<v Hou, Eric>among those 3.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9287-0
01:41:16.463 --> 01:41:21.943
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will color this dot blue.
As you can imagine.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9306-0
01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:29.263
<v Hou, Eric>Some of the dots around blue will be
colored blue, and some of them here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9310-0
01:41:29.263 --> 01:41:31.943
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
this one may be colored by red.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9317-0
01:41:32.573 --> 01:41:35.133
<v Hou, Eric>And some of this could be colored by
green.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9320-0
01:41:35.373 --> 01:41:36.973
<v Hou, Eric>So let's run the 1st a.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9341-0
01:41:39.763 --> 01:41:47.098
<v Hou, Eric>The first step I calculate the distance I
found sum of the points are close to this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9341-1
01:41:47.098 --> 01:41:47.883
<v Hou, Eric>blue dot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9353-0
01:41:48.043 --> 01:41:50.216
<v Hou, Eric>Some of the points are close to this red
dot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9353-1
01:41:50.216 --> 01:41:52.483
<v Hou, Eric>Some of the points are close to this
green dot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9357-0
01:41:52.483 --> 01:41:54.163
<v Hou, Eric>So then I color them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9365-0
01:41:54.523 --> 01:42:01.483
<v Hou, Eric>I contact everything to this randomly
selected dot in this 2D plane, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9381-0
01:42:03.023 --> 01:42:11.583
<v Hou, Eric>So once this step is being done,
what next step is, you know those blue?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9390-0
01:42:11.933 --> 01:42:16.533
<v Hou, Eric>Who does hear you? You colored blue.
You gonna calculate?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9394-0
01:42:16.533 --> 01:42:18.493
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna recalculate an average.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9406-0
01:42:20.063 --> 01:42:23.441
<v Hou, Eric>Among all the dots,
you just colored in blue,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9406-1
01:42:23.441 --> 01:42:25.423
<v Hou, Eric>so now be some dot in here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9434-0
01:42:27.423 --> 01:42:31.955
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
I can show you and then for all the dots,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9434-1
01:42:31.955 --> 01:42:36.836
<v Hou, Eric>you colored red,
you're gonna recalculate the center of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9434-2
01:42:36.836 --> 01:42:38.143
<v Hou, Eric>those red dots.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9438-0
01:42:38.143 --> 01:42:40.263
<v Hou, Eric>There could be some some red down in here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9458-0
01:42:41.253 --> 01:42:44.501
<v Hou, Eric>And for the similar thing happened to the
dots in green.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9458-1
01:42:44.501 --> 01:42:47.293
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna recalculate the average.
Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9462-0
01:42:49.833 --> 01:42:50.353
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9501-0
01:42:51.073 --> 01:42:56.564
<v Hou, Eric>See the algorithm recalculated average.
The center of those points and moved</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9501-1
01:42:56.564 --> 01:43:01.840
<v Hou, Eric>around the original randomly selected
dots to the center of those points.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9501-2
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.833
<v Hou, Eric>The center of those dots and centre of
those stars. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9512-0
01:43:05.953 --> 01:43:15.073
<v Hou, Eric>So now you have a new set of three points
or three centers, and then we call them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9518-0
01:43:15.863 --> 01:43:18.183
<v Hou, Eric>Centralized.
So those three centers are here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9523-0
01:43:19.603 --> 01:43:21.403
<v Hou, Eric>What are you going to do next?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9566-0
01:43:22.943 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Hou, Eric>What actually happened is for those blue
dots, red dots and green dots,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9566-1
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:37.038
<v Hou, Eric>you going to recolor them so white and
recalculate the distance to this blue to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9566-2
01:43:37.038 --> 01:43:44.641
<v Hou, Eric>this new blue and new red and new green
and still select to which center you have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9566-3
01:43:44.641 --> 01:43:47.423
<v Hou, Eric>the smallest distance and you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9570-0
01:43:47.423 --> 01:43:48.463
<v Hou, Eric>Going to mark that dot.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9580-0
01:43:48.773 --> 01:43:53.093
<v Hou, Eric>To the corresponding color.
For example this one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9592-0
01:43:54.663 --> 01:43:58.543
<v Hou, Eric>May be closer to this blue,
but farther to this to this red.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9607-0
01:43:58.943 --> 01:44:06.681
<v Hou, Eric>I Willy change the color of this red to
blue instead of red and for example this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9607-1
01:44:06.681 --> 01:44:07.063
<v Hou, Eric>one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9625-0
01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:10.788
<v Hou, Eric>Oh wow, this one is bad example,
but for this one it could be close to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9625-1
01:44:10.788 --> 01:44:12.463
<v Hou, Eric>this red, not close to this grid.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9636-0
01:44:12.463 --> 01:44:16.263
<v Hou, Eric>I may color this to to red,
so that's going to be the next step.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9652-0
01:44:18.893 --> 01:44:23.645
<v Hou, Eric>Here, right.
So this this one turns to this blue area</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9652-1
01:44:23.645 --> 01:44:26.373
<v Hou, Eric>and this this dark turn to red.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9687-0
01:44:27.093 --> 01:44:33.733
<v Hou, Eric>So then next steps you can do do the
similar thing since you have change of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9687-1
01:44:33.733 --> 01:44:38.539
<v Hou, Eric>definition of a blue group,
Red group and Green Group,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9687-2
01:44:38.539 --> 01:44:43.693
<v Hou, Eric>you can still keep calculating the
average of the current.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9693-0
01:44:44.503 --> 01:44:46.983
<v Hou, Eric>Blue Group, Red Group and Green group.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9706-0
01:44:49.153 --> 01:44:53.582
<v Hou, Eric>And move those 3 corresponding centers.
As you can see,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9706-1
01:44:53.582 --> 01:44:56.033
<v Hou, Eric>the red move from here to here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9718-0
01:44:56.593 --> 01:45:00.953
<v Hou, Eric>Next up is recalculate distance for every
dot to those three centers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9722-0
01:45:04.143 --> 01:45:05.303
<v Hou, Eric>And keep doing this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9724-0
01:45:07.503 --> 01:45:08.263
<v Hou, Eric>I guess you to run.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9732-0
01:45:09.823 --> 01:45:11.983
<v Hou, Eric>Yvonneuri it will converge.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9741-0
01:45:13.663 --> 01:45:15.463
<v Hou, Eric>So the center doesn't move.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9760-0
01:45:15.903 --> 01:45:19.310
<v Hou, Eric>You have those three groups static going
forward,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9760-1
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:23.943
<v Hou, Eric>no matter how how many times I hit a run,
I'm actually hit and run.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9766-0
01:45:23.943 --> 01:45:25.463
<v Hou, Eric>You don't see it by see it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9778-0
01:45:26.503 --> 01:45:32.570
<v Hou, Eric>The structure doesn't change,
so then this is the end of this K means</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9778-1
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:35.343
<v Hou, Eric>we successfully we successfully.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9785-0
01:45:37.023 --> 01:45:39.503
<v Hou, Eric>Put those dots into three groups.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9789-0
01:45:40.903 --> 01:45:41.303
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9793-0
01:45:41.303 --> 01:45:42.583
<v Hou, Eric>So that's how it happened.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9798-0
01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.263
<v Hou, Eric>So let me start it over.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9804-0
01:45:44.663 --> 01:45:48.143
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say we have 100 points.
Let's say we have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9822-0
01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:53.905
<v Hou, Eric>Four groups I wanna do a center,
100 points to four groups.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9822-1
01:45:53.905 --> 01:45:57.303
<v Hou, Eric>I wanna still draw centralized and let me
do it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9824-0
01:45:58.983 --> 01:45:59.223
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9826-0
01:46:00.823 --> 01:46:00.983
<v Hou, Eric>Well.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9830-0
01:46:02.053 --> 01:46:03.133
<v Hou, Eric>I saw a photo.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9833-0
01:46:09.603 --> 01:46:10.163
<v Hou, Eric>Not this one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9837-0
01:46:12.553 --> 01:46:14.713
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Do I have another one?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9847-0
01:46:18.453 --> 01:46:22.533
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I have a four of groups.
I'll hit and run and you can see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9851-0
01:46:36.193 --> 01:46:36.673
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9880-0
01:46:37.193 --> 01:46:43.465
<v Hou, Eric>So this machine gonna or or this chart or
this this this number of dots gonna learn</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9880-1
01:46:43.465 --> 01:46:49.215
<v Hou, Eric>itself to eventually group themselves
into four groups or four sets and this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9880-2
01:46:49.215 --> 01:46:49.513
<v Hou, Eric>one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9885-0
01:46:49.753 --> 01:46:50.993
<v Hou, Eric>How we calculate this?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9922-0
01:46:51.233 --> 01:46:56.225
<v Hou, Eric>Because we're using the average of those
dots in those temporal group and that's</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9922-1
01:46:56.225 --> 01:47:01.156
<v Hou, Eric>why we call it K means where K means the
number of groups and means is that way</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9922-2
01:47:01.156 --> 01:47:05.593
<v Hou, Eric>that we find the center of the group and
group those dots to different.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9931-0
01:47:06.413 --> 01:47:09.093
<v Hou, Eric>Buckets.
So that's why it's called K means.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9941-0
01:47:09.493 --> 01:47:14.576
<v Hou, Eric>So this is this is demonstration of K
means clustering on algorithm.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9941-1
01:47:14.576 --> 01:47:15.533
<v Hou, Eric>Any question?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9945-0
01:47:30.853 --> 01:47:31.453
<v Hou, Eric>No, no question.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9952-0
01:47:34.753 --> 01:47:37.273
<v Hou, Eric>OK, I assume there is no question.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9955-0
01:47:42.713 --> 01:47:43.193
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9964-0
01:47:43.673 --> 01:47:48.753
<v Hou, Eric>So this is basically telling you the
process of this K means analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9977-0
01:47:49.153 --> 01:47:55.113
<v Hou, Eric>Have you ever used a K means analysis in
in in your real work before this class?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9980-0
01:47:57.923 --> 01:47:58.363
<v Carone, Matt>I have not.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9988-0
01:47:59.173 --> 01:48:01.813
<v Hou, Eric>OK, OK. OK. So it's OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/9989-0
01:48:01.893 --> 01:48:02.293
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10001-0
01:48:04.383 --> 01:48:08.823
<v Hou, Eric>So how can you actually use the K means
analysis and and finance marketing?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10007-0
01:48:08.823 --> 01:48:10.303
<v Hou, Eric>So basically some use cases, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10018-0
01:48:10.303 --> 01:48:13.383
<v Hou, Eric>So then K means analysis can be used in
marketing for sure.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10028-0
01:48:13.503 --> 01:48:17.103
<v Hou, Eric>So you have you collect the data of your
customers, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10030-0
01:48:17.103 --> 01:48:18.183
<v Hou, Eric>So then you want to know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10053-0
01:48:19.863 --> 01:48:26.259
<v Hou, Eric>How can I group those customers into
different buckets so then it can analyze</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10053-1
01:48:26.259 --> 01:48:29.703
<v Hou, Eric>similar behavior of those those customers?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10061-0
01:48:30.573 --> 01:48:32.413
<v Hou, Eric>Now we are really good analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10073-0
01:48:32.413 --> 01:48:36.736
<v Hou, Eric>Now you wanna do for your marketing team
and then you're gonna derive a lot of</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10073-1
01:48:36.736 --> 01:48:37.173
<v Hou, Eric>insight.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10082-0
01:48:38.743 --> 01:48:40.383
<v Hou, Eric>In my own company, we also do this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10105-0
01:48:40.383 --> 01:48:47.423
<v Hou, Eric>We have a lot of users of the 3D printers
so that we do what we doing is we we</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10105-1
01:48:47.423 --> 01:48:51.343
<v Hou, Eric>collect their usage data and we wanna
know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10126-0
01:48:53.103 --> 01:48:57.725
<v Hou, Eric>How often they use those those printers
and actually how they are going to use</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10126-1
01:48:57.725 --> 01:49:01.703
<v Hou, Eric>those printers and and and are they using
those printer based upon.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10136-0
01:49:03.973 --> 01:49:06.053
<v Hou, Eric>Apps or different other apps?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10153-0
01:49:06.253 --> 01:49:10.996
<v Hou, Eric>So we create those kind of a data set and
who they are using what how often they</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10153-1
01:49:10.996 --> 01:49:14.333
<v Hou, Eric>use and then how they use it.
Those kind of information.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10163-0
01:49:14.893 --> 01:49:17.693
<v Hou, Eric>And then we pull those data into this
clustering analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10171-0
01:49:17.693 --> 01:49:19.773
<v Hou, Eric>So we can analyze OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10175-0
01:49:20.133 --> 01:49:22.213
<v Hou, Eric>We do know a lot of users.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10189-0
01:49:22.253 --> 01:49:27.493
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of companies are buying 1 printer
and then shared by a lot of users.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10226-0
01:49:27.693 --> 01:49:32.453
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one behavior that we have seen
for a group of customers for another</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10226-1
01:49:32.453 --> 01:49:36.188
<v Hou, Eric>group of customers is only like one
single user of a printer.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10226-2
01:49:36.188 --> 01:49:39.923
<v Hou, Eric>Although that company could be could be a
really big company,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10226-3
01:49:39.923 --> 01:49:42.333
<v Hou, Eric>but they are not sharing those printers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10231-0
01:49:43.103 --> 01:49:44.383
<v Hou, Eric>But some of companies that really.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10252-0
01:49:45.423 --> 01:49:49.137
<v Hou, Eric>Either sharing the printers or not,
but they're using the printer not as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10252-1
01:49:49.137 --> 01:49:50.663
<v Hou, Eric>often as the other two groups.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10297-0
01:49:50.663 --> 01:49:55.335
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're really putting those data
together into different groups,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10297-1
01:49:55.335 --> 01:50:00.455
<v Hou, Eric>so then you are saving a lot of effort to
analyse those groups and you can even</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10297-2
01:50:00.455 --> 01:50:03.527
<v Hou, Eric>providing profile those group in a way
that OK,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10297-3
01:50:03.527 --> 01:50:07.943
<v Hou, Eric>this is a really high volume customers
and this is really the frequ.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10314-0
01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:13.158
<v Hou, Eric>Usage using customers so that you can
define design different strategies</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10314-1
01:50:13.158 --> 01:50:14.463
<v Hou, Eric>setting strategies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10328-0
01:50:15.363 --> 01:50:18.963
<v Hou, Eric>Or marketing strategies to different
groups based upon their behaviour.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10329-0
01:50:18.963 --> 01:50:20.323
<v Hou, Eric>Analysis. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10340-0
01:50:22.813 --> 01:50:27.133
<v Hou, Eric>So, so in finance,
we can definitely do that, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10345-0
01:50:27.133 --> 01:50:29.053
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's think in this way.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10349-0
01:50:29.213 --> 01:50:30.773
<v Hou, Eric>So if your boss.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10363-0
01:50:31.293 --> 01:50:35.384
<v Hou, Eric>If your boss right so then your boss is
director of your finance corporate</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10363-1
01:50:35.384 --> 01:50:36.693
<v Hou, Eric>finance, right. So then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10380-0
01:50:38.463 --> 01:50:44.424
<v Hou, Eric>Your boss want to or or or hash fun or or
any investment institute.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10380-1
01:50:44.424 --> 01:50:46.703
<v Hou, Eric>So your boss want to know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10388-0
01:50:48.503 --> 01:50:50.343
<v Hou, Eric>There's so many stocks in the market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10395-0
01:50:52.543 --> 01:50:55.063
<v Hou, Eric>Is there a way I can group the stocks
together?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10402-0
01:50:57.383 --> 01:50:59.863
<v Hou, Eric>How can you answer that question?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10407-0
01:50:59.863 --> 01:51:03.623
<v Hou, Eric>Using what you just learned in this class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10412-0
01:51:08.553 --> 01:51:10.713
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see, the question is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10414-0
01:51:13.373 --> 01:51:14.213

<v Hou, Eric>I want to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10422-0
01:51:19.903 --> 01:51:23.023
<v Hou, Eric>Group your friend stocks together.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10424-0
01:51:26.693 --> 01:51:27.493
<v Hou, Eric>Do you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10427-0
01:51:32.333 --> 01:51:34.613
<v Hou, Eric>Have any idea?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10432-0
01:51:38.183 --> 01:51:40.903
<v Hou, Eric>You say, OK, let me try.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10440-0
01:51:43.303 --> 01:51:48.103
<v Hou, Eric>To use what I learned from Eric's class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10443-0
01:51:50.113 --> 01:51:51.033
<v Hou, Eric>What can I do?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10446-0
01:51:54.503 --> 01:51:55.703
<v Hou, Eric>Here is what I'm going to do.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10448-0
01:52:01.653 --> 01:52:02.133
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10450-0
01:52:03.663 --> 01:52:03.703
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10453-0
01:52:05.943 --> 01:52:06.863
<v Hou, Eric>So what are you going to do?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10458-0
01:52:09.143 --> 01:52:10.343
<v Hou, Eric>And one metrics.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10462-0
01:52:12.743 --> 01:52:13.943
<v Hou, Eric>Are you go to use?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10465-0
01:52:18.743 --> 01:52:19.423
<v Hou, Eric>And how?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10467-0
01:52:21.893 --> 01:52:22.373
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10475-0
01:52:24.253 --> 01:52:26.373
<v Hou, Eric>So here's your boss question.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10482-0
01:52:26.653 --> 01:52:28.213
<v Hou, Eric>Here's what you're going to do.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10491-0
01:52:28.213 --> 01:52:32.157
<v Hou, Eric>The question is what kind of measures are
we going to use and how you're going to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10491-1
01:52:32.157 --> 01:52:32.493
<v Hou, Eric>use it?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10495-0
01:52:32.493 --> 01:52:33.733
<v Hou, Eric>How are you going to do it?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10497-0
01:52:34.613 --> 01:52:35.053
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10502-0
01:52:35.213 --> 01:52:36.973
<v Hou, Eric>Let's brainstorm it a little bit.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10506-0
01:52:37.533 --> 01:52:39.213
<v Hou, Eric>I will still try the rules.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10514-0
01:52:39.213 --> 01:52:41.733
<v Hou, Eric>I will separate you guys to 5:00 rooms
and then you have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10519-0
01:52:43.303 --> 01:52:44.623
<v Hou, Eric>That's little bit more to say.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10534-0
01:52:45.263 --> 01:52:49.585
<v Hou, Eric>8 minutes to think about this and and
hopefully you can have a better plan how</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10534-1
01:52:49.585 --> 01:52:51.663
<v Hou, Eric>to how to group those stocks together.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10550-0
01:52:52.573 --> 01:52:59.853
<v Hou, Eric>So how to steal 5-6 rooms and how are you
guys gonna see your peers in in different</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10550-1
01:52:59.853 --> 01:53:00.373
<v Hou, Eric>rooms?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10553-0
01:53:01.943 --> 01:53:02.503
<v Hou, Eric>Good luck.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10587-0
01:54:10.983 --> 01:54:11.823
<v Hou, Eric>Oh ****.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10660-0
02:00:04.893 --> 02:00:06.053
<v Hou, Eric>Close the ruins.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10686-0
02:00:27.213 --> 02:00:28.293
<v Hou, Eric>Hey, welcome back.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10691-0
02:00:30.143 --> 02:00:31.783
<v Hou, Eric>Is audio OK for you guys?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10693-0
02:00:32.223 --> 02:00:32.983
<v Hou, Eric>Can you hear me?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10695-0
02:00:34.253 --> 02:00:34.773
<v Hollenbach, Patrick>Yes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10696-0
02:00:35.023 --> 02:00:35.263
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10704-0
02:00:36.903 --> 02:00:40.023
<v Hou, Eric>Anyone has a idea how to answer your boss
question?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10727-0
02:00:48.493 --> 02:00:53.772
<v Mertens, Aidric>Would it possibly be Eric that K means
clustering that you showed us,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10727-1
02:00:53.772 --> 02:00:59.653
<v Mertens, Aidric>and then we would use it for maybe like
the beta or P/E or something similar?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10733-0
02:01:00.883 --> 02:01:04.003
<v Hou, Eric>So beta and P/E, yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10740-0
02:01:05.543 --> 02:01:06.903
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah, so right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10746-0
02:01:06.973 --> 02:01:10.133
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then that's why I'm saying,
yeah, you're gonna use this class, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10772-0
02:01:10.133 --> 02:01:12.931
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
definitely you're gonna use K means and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10772-1
02:01:12.931 --> 02:01:16.358
<v Hou, Eric>then in terms of metrics.
So you said you wanna use a beta,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10772-2
02:01:16.358 --> 02:01:18.413
<v Hou, Eric>you wanna use P and it's great idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10777-0
02:01:18.413 --> 02:01:22.213
<v Hou, Eric>So then other than beta and P anything
else you wanna use?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10789-0
02:01:27.593 --> 02:01:30.673
<v Mertens, Aidric>Maybe if there's some way to do
performance throughout time?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10798-0
02:01:31.393 --> 02:01:35.553
<v Hou, Eric>Performance such as a momentum,
momentum metrics.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10803-0
02:01:36.563 --> 02:01:37.403
<v Mertens, Aidric>Yeah, something similar.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10804-0
02:01:37.103 --> 02:01:37.263
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10806-0
02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:41.573
<v Hou, Eric>Any other thought?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10811-0
02:01:43.143 --> 02:01:46.263
<v Hou, Eric>It was very, very, very good idea,
very good idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10824-0
02:01:47.903 --> 02:01:51.069
<v Hou, Eric>Have you done this before?
And then did you see that doing this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10824-1
02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:52.503
<v Hou, Eric>provide any additional alpha?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10830-0
02:01:53.943 --> 02:01:54.983
<v Mertens, Aidric>No, I haven't.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10845-0
02:01:54.983 --> 02:01:57.741
<v Mertens, Aidric>But my boss is trying to get me into
Python,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10845-1
02:01:57.741 --> 02:02:00.743
<v Mertens, Aidric>so it's going well hand in hand with this
class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10840-0
02:01:58.993 --> 02:01:59.113
<v Hou, Eric>Huh.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10852-0
02:02:01.163 --> 02:02:02.683
<v Hou, Eric>Sure, sure. Sure. Gotcha.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10862-0
02:02:02.923 --> 02:02:07.083
<v Hou, Eric>So beta beta, P/E, performance, momentum,
those kind of things.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10866-0
02:02:07.083 --> 02:02:09.723
<v Hou, Eric>Yes. Any other thoughts that we can use?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10873-0
02:02:11.633 --> 02:02:13.793
<v Carone, Matt>I know this is work but maybe like market
cap.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10875-0
02:02:14.793 --> 02:02:15.673
<v Hou, Eric>Market cap.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10877-0
02:02:17.403 --> 02:02:17.963
<v Hou, Eric>Sounds great.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10879-0
02:02:23.573 --> 02:02:24.093
<v Hou, Eric>Other things.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10892-0
02:02:27.663 --> 02:02:34.303
<v Benbenek, MATT>Can you use like any qualitative metrics
for K means talk about like?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10907-0
02:02:35.863 --> 02:02:40.263
<v Benbenek, MATT>Sector industry like stuff you can pull
from a database but still like.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10912-0
02:02:40.683 --> 02:02:41.763
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, that's a good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10916-0
02:02:41.763 --> 02:02:43.083
<v Hou, Eric>That's a very good idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10929-0
02:02:43.083 --> 02:02:46.147
<v Hou, Eric>That's a very good idea.
so-called datab information such as</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10929-1
02:02:46.147 --> 02:02:47.603
<v Hou, Eric>hierarchy information, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10939-0
02:02:51.983 --> 02:02:55.343
<v Hou, Eric>So for example, like sector industry,
those kind of information.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10946-0
02:02:55.343 --> 02:02:58.383
<v Hou, Eric>So then it depends how you gonna use it,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10953-0
02:02:58.383 --> 02:03:01.303
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so you have two routes to go.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10954-0
02:03:01.303 --> 02:03:01.663
<v Hou, Eric>You can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10963-0
02:03:01.663 --> 02:03:04.703
<v Hou, Eric>You can create a static model so that is
a static.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10970-0
02:03:06.383 --> 02:03:09.943
<v Hou, Eric>Groups of those of those stocks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10976-0
02:03:10.263 --> 02:03:13.223
<v Hou, Eric>So using those hierarchy sector.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10994-0
02:03:14.903 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Hou, Eric>Industry information.
So you really do want to use those ones</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10994-1
02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.183
<v Hou, Eric>in the K means and you want the machine
to determine.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/10998-0
02:03:21.613 --> 02:03:23.333
<v Hou, Eric>Was the right group right? So then?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11017-0
02:03:24.903 --> 02:03:28.593
<v Hou, Eric>You can still do that and then you need
to convert those those information.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11017-1
02:03:28.593 --> 02:03:31.263
<v Hou, Eric>You need to quantify those information,
unfortunately.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11023-0
02:03:32.373 --> 02:03:33.733
<v Hou, Eric>So then there there's still.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11029-0
02:03:33.733 --> 02:03:37.813
<v Hou, Eric>You can still use K means Long story
short, OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11032-0
02:03:37.813 --> 02:03:38.893
<v Hou, Eric>I think I think those are good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11042-0
02:03:38.893 --> 02:03:41.573
<v Hou, Eric>So Long story short,
you know you can actually use whatever.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11056-0
02:03:41.973 --> 02:03:44.893
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, data, you know,
just put data together and then use them.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11060-0
02:03:44.893 --> 02:03:46.933
<v Hou, Eric>So then what I have tried?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11071-0
02:03:46.933 --> 02:03:49.933
<v Hou, Eric>Remember we talked about the three factor
3 factor model, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11074-0
02:03:49.933 --> 02:03:51.253
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can actually do.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11078-0
02:03:51.733 --> 02:03:52.493
<v Hou, Eric>The beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11085-0
02:03:52.493 --> 02:03:54.973
<v Hou, Eric>The betas right the market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11092-0
02:03:55.173 --> 02:04:01.093
<v Hou, Eric>The market access return beta,
the S minus big beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11100-0
02:04:02.743 --> 02:04:05.143
<v Hou, Eric>And and also high minus low beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11110-0
02:04:06.903 --> 02:04:09.023
<v Hou, Eric>So this is my this is my choice right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11114-0
02:04:09.023 --> 02:04:10.543
<v Hou, Eric>So then not necessarily.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11144-0
02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:14.340
<v Hou, Eric>They will be the best choice,
but I did this analysis I I this idea</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11144-1
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:17.691
<v Hou, Eric>came to my mind last night. I feel oh,
this is a good idea.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11144-2
02:04:17.691 --> 02:04:21.543
<v Hou, Eric>And so when you do this, right.
So I'm going to show you what I did.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11148-0
02:04:24.083 --> 02:04:24.443
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11153-0
02:04:25.003 --> 02:04:25.883
<v Hou, Eric>Is that the bankruptcy?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11154-0
02:04:25.883 --> 02:04:26.603
<v Hou, Eric>Let's do this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11156-0
02:04:30.283 --> 02:04:30.683
<v Hou, Eric>Oh here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11159-0
02:04:33.193 --> 02:04:34.273
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully it's still running.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11163-0
02:04:37.133 --> 02:04:38.173
<v Hou, Eric>Restart call space.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11165-0
02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:44.423
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11170-0
02:04:48.693 --> 02:04:50.933
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry, I just starting the call space.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11172-0
02:05:03.373 --> 02:05:03.693
<v Hou, Eric>Here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11180-0
02:05:09.413 --> 02:05:12.773
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just erase all outputs. OK, so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11185-0
02:05:14.343 --> 02:05:15.223
<v Hou, Eric>Looks similar, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11199-0
02:05:15.223 --> 02:05:20.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then we gonna we gonna still download
data from the Yahoo Finance.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11199-1
02:05:20.518 --> 02:05:23.543
<v Hou, Eric>So this this time I do have all tickers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11217-0
02:05:25.703 --> 02:05:32.437
<v Hou, Eric>At least they have 100 billion,
100 billion markets capitalized to 20</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11217-1
02:05:32.437 --> 02:05:33.303
<v Hou, Eric>trillion.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11231-0
02:05:33.303 --> 02:05:35.880
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
I don't think there's any Chinese company</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11231-1
02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.583
<v Hou, Eric>that is a 20 trading yet,
but I do have the list of those companies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11242-0
02:05:40.133 --> 02:05:43.128
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then you can see some big companies</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11242-1
02:05:43.128 --> 02:05:43.453
<v Hou, Eric>here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11247-0
02:05:43.453 --> 02:05:46.133
<v Hou, Eric>NVIDIA, Apple or here I I did find.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11255-0
02:05:47.703 --> 02:05:49.863
<v Hou, Eric>So many tickers, 383.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11273-0
02:05:51.583 --> 02:05:54.875
<v Hou, Eric>And then if your question is how did I
find those tickers,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11273-1
02:05:54.875 --> 02:05:58.223
<v Hou, Eric>I can even show you the way you can do it
after this class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11279-0
02:06:00.703 --> 02:06:01.983
<v Hou, Eric>This class and then you can.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11297-0
02:06:01.983 --> 02:06:05.910
<v Hou, Eric>You can try yourself.
So then there is some project I'm working</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11297-1
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:08.303
<v Hou, Eric>on. The financial reporting AI so then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11301-0
02:06:09.493 --> 02:06:10.773
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, yes, there's some.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11309-0
02:06:15.183 --> 02:06:16.943
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, so there is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11322-0
02:06:17.263 --> 02:06:20.567
<v Hou, Eric>There is a database called a financial
modeling for apps,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11322-1
02:06:20.567 --> 02:06:22.503
<v Hou, Eric>so this is really really good API.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11328-0
02:06:24.853 --> 02:06:26.853
<v Hou, Eric>You you wanna you wanna.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11331-0
02:06:26.853 --> 02:06:27.533
<v Hou, Eric>You wanna try?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11333-0
02:06:27.533 --> 02:06:28.933
<v Hou, Eric>You wanna use, right? So then?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11351-0
02:06:33.093 --> 02:06:37.869
<v Hou, Eric>You guys are search for financial model
reports and then as Ashley Financial</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11351-1
02:06:37.869 --> 02:06:41.093
<v Hou, Eric>model report financial modeling,
prep this website.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11368-0
02:06:42.013 --> 02:06:48.623
<v Hou, Eric>I did subscribe this one so they do have
APIs and then for the APIs you can see</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11368-1
02:06:48.623 --> 02:06:50.853
<v Hou, Eric>all different kind of data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11390-0
02:06:52.423 --> 02:06:55.184
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
there they they provide you the financial</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11390-1
02:06:55.184 --> 02:06:58.044
<v Hou, Eric>statement data.
They provide you different different the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11390-2
02:06:58.044 --> 02:07:00.503
<v Hou, Eric>key metrics.
So you can just pull the data here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11398-0
02:07:01.173 --> 02:07:05.413
<v Hou, Eric>Uh,
what I did is the large cap tag deep dive.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11400-0
02:07:06.013 --> 02:07:07.053
<v Hou, Eric>So instead of.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11442-0
02:07:08.823 --> 02:07:15.722
<v Hou, Eric>So what I did is I set up some parameters,
just give me any market cap more than so</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11442-1
02:07:15.722 --> 02:07:19.746
<v Hou, Eric>many zeros,
but 100 hundred B and market capital</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11442-2
02:07:19.746 --> 02:07:26.562
<v Hou, Eric>lower than twentyt and then just give me
as many as no no more than 1000 companies</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11442-3
02:07:26.562 --> 02:07:27.383
<v Hou, Eric>in the US.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11453-0
02:07:27.463 --> 02:07:30.623
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then it's actually actively trading.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11457-0
02:07:31.023 --> 02:07:33.903
<v Hou, Eric>So give me those those those tickers.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11495-0
02:07:35.133 --> 02:07:41.666
<v Hou, Eric>Once you set this parameter up and then
you just you just do the request to send</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11495-1
02:07:41.666 --> 02:07:47.554
<v Hou, Eric>the request to this FM PAPI and then you
you send these parameters over,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11495-2
02:07:47.554 --> 02:07:49.973
<v Hou, Eric>they're going to start return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11503-0
02:07:50.733 --> 02:07:53.173
<v Hou, Eric>You know the tickers of those big
companies?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11522-0
02:07:53.693 --> 02:07:57.677
<v Hou, Eric>So so for example,
like you have the apple you have NVIDIA,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11522-1
02:07:57.677 --> 02:08:02.060
<v Hou, Eric>you have the company name,
you have the market cap as of the time</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11522-2
02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:03.653
<v Hou, Eric>you're pulling the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11540-0
02:08:04.253 --> 02:08:07.962
<v Hou, Eric>The country,
the sector and industry of of of this,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11540-1
02:08:07.962 --> 02:08:10.173
<v Hou, Eric>of this company of this ticker.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11548-0
02:08:10.533 --> 02:08:14.253
<v Hou, Eric>So you just run the four loop,
meaning you just run through.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11575-0
02:08:15.213 --> 02:08:20.996
<v Hou, Eric>All the requests and then to the API and
then you have this list of those big</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11575-1
02:08:20.996 --> 02:08:26.333
<v Hou, Eric>companies and then I just put everything
together and save it as a CSV.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11589-0
02:08:26.333 --> 02:08:31.093
<v Hou, Eric>So I have the list format analysis and
then I uploaded these to here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11605-0
02:08:31.293 --> 02:08:37.493
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the companies I I grab from
the API. I do have their ticker.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11607-0
02:08:37.773 --> 02:08:39.293
<v Hou, Eric>I do have their company name.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11614-0
02:08:40.103 --> 02:08:43.543
<v Hou, Eric>I do have their market, the market cap.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11622-0
02:08:44.403 --> 02:08:46.243
<v Hou, Eric>At the moment I'm pulling the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11630-0
02:08:46.603 --> 02:08:49.443
<v Hou, Eric>I do have the sector that company belongs
to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11635-0
02:08:49.643 --> 02:08:50.923
<v Hou, Eric>I do have the industry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11637-0
02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:51.883
<v Hou, Eric>That company belongs to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11640-0
02:08:52.213 --> 02:08:52.773
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11643-0
02:08:52.813 --> 02:08:54.013
<v Hou, Eric>So this is everything.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11647-0
02:08:54.013 --> 02:08:55.333
<v Hou, Eric>All big companies.</v>

02:08:55.333 --> 02:08:57.053
<v Hou, Eric>At least $100 billion.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11654-0
02:08:58.623 --> 02:08:59.823

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11684-1
02:09:07.576 --> 02:09:12.463
<v Hou, Eric>use a Yahoo download to download all the
daily datas for those tickers, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11686-0
02:09:12.463 --> 02:09:13.583
<v Hou, Eric>So then you run it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11691-0
02:09:16.023 --> 02:09:17.943

02:09:19.783 --> 02:09:25.703
<v Hou, Eric>You're actually gonna download 176 from
from the Yahoo Finance API.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11718-0
02:09:25.703 --> 02:09:30.924
<v Hou, Eric>I did some cleaning so that I'm not
downloading everything so but these are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11718-1
02:09:30.924 --> 02:09:32.503
<v Hou, Eric>176. I I will download.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11733-0
02:09:35.903 --> 02:09:40.856
<v Hou, Eric>From the API,
so now I'm I'm I'm able to see who they</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11733-1
02:09:40.856 --> 02:09:41.223
<v Hou, Eric>are.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11740-0
02:09:41.223 --> 02:09:44.103
<v Hou, Eric>So then I do see this apple there is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11747-0
02:09:46.543 --> 02:09:48.903
<v Hou, Eric>Abt. There are so many big companies here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11749-0
02:09:51.623 --> 02:09:52.343
<v Hou, Eric>In in the list.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11756-0
02:09:52.693 --> 02:09:55.516
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then let me show you who they are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11756-1
02:09:55.516 --> 02:09:56.093
<v Hou, Eric>actually.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11763-0
02:10:11.493 --> 02:10:13.573
<v Hou, Eric>There are so many columns, I'm sorry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11774-0
02:10:15.893 --> 02:10:21.253
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, you can do this. And so here.
Those are the companies in my analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11785-0
02:10:22.053 --> 02:10:26.573
<v Hou, Eric>167 of them e-mail analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11792-0
02:10:27.053 --> 02:10:30.413
<v Hou, Eric>So what I'm going to do is right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11806-0
02:10:30.413 --> 02:10:36.413
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm still using the the pharma
French daily factor, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11809-0
02:10:36.413 --> 02:10:38.213
<v Hou, Eric>So then I load this data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11823-0
02:10:40.693 --> 02:10:49.573
<v Hou, Eric>I merged the Fama French factor to those
big market cap companies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11827-0
02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:52.663
<v Hou, Eric>I want to run.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11837-0
02:10:54.343 --> 02:10:57.463
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty much the the three factor model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11855-0
02:10:58.103 --> 02:11:03.378
<v Hou, Eric>So for every stock in that list,
I'm showing you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11855-1
02:11:03.378 --> 02:11:08.863
<v Hou, Eric>So I gonna run a 3 factor model and I
wanna record.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11861-0
02:11:09.403 --> 02:11:13.683
<v Hou, Eric>I want to record their beta associated
with market access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11883-0
02:11:15.223 --> 02:11:19.470
<v Hou, Eric>I want to record a beta associated with
the SMB.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11883-1
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:23.543
<v Hou, Eric>I want to record the beta associated with
Hml.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11895-0
02:11:23.543 --> 02:11:28.124
<v Hou, Eric>I keep the ticker so that I can create
this data frame,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11895-1
02:11:28.124 --> 02:11:30.823
<v Hou, Eric>recording all the betas together.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11898-0
02:11:33.053 --> 02:11:33.493
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11903-0
02:11:34.373 --> 02:11:36.893
<v Hou, Eric>So it's running super fast.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11910-0
02:11:37.253 --> 02:11:40.013
<v Hou, Eric>So then later on you can actually see,
I'm sorry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11916-0
02:11:41.583 --> 02:11:43.583
<v Hou, Eric>See, this is Apple.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11924-0
02:11:43.623 --> 02:11:46.543
<v Hou, Eric>This is a this is a beta associated
market access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11935-0
02:11:46.943 --> 02:11:51.103
<v Hou, Eric>It's a beta associated with this,
with SMB beta associated with hml.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11948-0
02:11:52.823 --> 02:11:57.623
<v Hou, Eric>For company Apple and I also merged their
ticker.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11956-0
02:11:57.623 --> 02:12:01.943
<v Hou, Eric>Their name, their capital market cap,
their sector, their industry.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11958-0
02:12:03.023 --> 02:12:03.343
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11964-0
02:12:03.343 --> 02:12:05.143
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have all the information in
here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11969-0
02:12:06.663 --> 02:12:07.623
<v Hou, Eric>For for this company, Apple.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11975-0
02:12:08.813 --> 02:12:11.893
<v Hou, Eric>Or for other companies I recorded all the
betas.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11990-0
02:12:13.463 --> 02:12:17.339
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so this is really the K means you gonna</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/11990-1
02:12:17.339 --> 02:12:20.423
<v Hou, Eric>you gonna import K means as a function.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12019-0
02:12:22.343 --> 02:12:27.749
<v Hou, Eric>From SK clusters and then so this one
after you load or import this km in</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12019-1
02:12:27.749 --> 02:12:33.446
<v Hou, Eric>functions from this package you're gonna
use you can you can exercise K means</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12019-2
02:12:33.446 --> 02:12:34.103
<v Hou, Eric>analysis.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12043-0
02:12:35.783 --> 02:12:42.165
<v Hou, Eric>And I also import is ask score and what
does this ask score do from this SK learn</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12043-1
02:12:42.165 --> 02:12:47.223
<v Hou, Eric>matrix this S score gonna determine what
it based upon the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12051-0
02:12:47.823 --> 02:12:48.743
<v Hou, Eric>That we have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12063-0
02:12:49.103 --> 02:12:55.903
<v Hou, Eric>What is the optimal number of clusters
that we can actually pull those number?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12071-0
02:12:55.903 --> 02:12:57.943
<v Hou, Eric>You know more than 100 stocks too.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12078-0
02:12:58.423 --> 02:13:01.503
<v Hou, Eric>So sometimes you know the S score going
to suggest you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12100-0
02:13:01.503 --> 02:13:04.386
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe you can only have two buckets that
that's the.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12100-1
02:13:04.386 --> 02:13:07.703
<v Hou, Eric>That's how your data is suggesting.
But sometimes it's more.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12108-0
02:13:07.703 --> 02:13:10.343
<v Hou, Eric>But you want to know what's the best
number of buckets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12117-0
02:13:10.343 --> 02:13:14.583
<v Hou, Eric>You want to put those data into,
so then this S work going to work on that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12145-0
02:13:15.333 --> 02:13:19.635
<v Hou, Eric>So then the data I'm going to use,
I'm going to use as a input for K,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12145-1
02:13:19.635 --> 02:13:24.304
<v Hou, Eric>means analysis going to be the better
associated with market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12145-2
02:13:24.304 --> 02:13:25.533
<v Hou, Eric>The better of those.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12158-0
02:13:25.533 --> 02:13:30.933
<v Hou, Eric>So should with small minded speak the
better associated with a high minus low?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12175-0
02:13:30.973 --> 02:13:36.345
<v Hou, Eric>I really want to know like what are the
similar company is to to to Apple based</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12175-1
02:13:36.345 --> 02:13:38.493
<v Hou, Eric>upon the three factor model. OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12179-0
02:13:38.693 --> 02:13:40.093
<v Hou, Eric>So then I run this code.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12192-0
02:13:40.903 --> 02:13:44.583
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have this X which is a model
input prepared.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12213-0
02:13:46.443 --> 02:13:53.308
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have this auto input prepared.
I going to run from two buckets or two</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12213-1
02:13:53.308 --> 02:13:56.483
<v Hou, Eric>clusters to 11 clusters and for each.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12230-0
02:13:58.023 --> 02:14:04.885
<v Hou, Eric>Possibility I will calculate this S score,
so *** score eventually will look like</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12230-1
02:14:04.885 --> 02:14:05.303
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12235-0
02:14:06.383 --> 02:14:07.903
<v Hou, Eric>Or an El elbow score.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12246-0
02:14:08.543 --> 02:14:12.663
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
let's just use as score so as score.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12257-0
02:14:12.663 --> 02:14:17.223
<v Hou, Eric>What does ask score do is, Oh my gosh,
I'm going to install this.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12259-0
02:14:17.543 --> 02:14:18.783
<v Hou, Eric>So you gonna pick?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12298-0
02:14:20.463 --> 02:14:27.501
<v Hou, Eric>The the highest score as the maximum as
as the optimal number of buckets or</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12298-1
02:14:27.501 --> 02:14:32.131
<v Hou, Eric>number of clusters. In this case,
as you can see,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12298-2
02:14:32.131 --> 02:14:38.799
<v Hou, Eric>the highest number is actually 7,
so you can actually group those those</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12298-3
02:14:38.799 --> 02:14:40.743
<v Hou, Eric>stocks into 7 into 7.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12300-0
02:14:41.173 --> 02:14:41.933
<v Hou, Eric>Clusters.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12330-0
02:14:43.743 --> 02:14:48.008
<v Hou, Eric>Just for the time sake,
I'm now going to use seven because so</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12330-1
02:14:48.008 --> 02:14:52.067
<v Hou, Eric>many data to analyze.
So I chose to use the second biggest</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12330-2
02:14:52.067 --> 02:14:52.823
<v Hou, Eric>which is 4.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12336-0
02:14:53.223 --> 02:14:56.903
<v Hou, Eric>It has a really high score,
suggesting it is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12349-0
02:14:57.743 --> 02:15:02.183
<v Hou, Eric>This is really good to have 4 buckets,
but definitely seven will be great.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12356-0
02:15:03.063 --> 02:15:08.303
<v Hou, Eric>So then I put the data into 4 buckets
suggesting here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12361-0
02:15:09.623 --> 02:15:11.063
<v Hou, Eric>And this K means.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12371-0
02:15:11.613 --> 02:15:14.253
<v Hou, Eric>Is that real access you gonna run?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12376-0
02:15:14.253 --> 02:15:18.333
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna pull those data into different
into 4 clusters?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12402-0
02:15:18.863 --> 02:15:23.921
<v Hou, Eric>And you're you're putting this in the
optimal clusters from the S score</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12402-1
02:15:23.921 --> 02:15:28.066
<v Hou, Eric>analysis 4 here,
and then you you have to specify a random</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12402-2
02:15:28.066 --> 02:15:30.103
<v Hou, Eric>state and random state is 20.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12406-0
02:15:30.343 --> 02:15:31.903
<v Hou, Eric>So what is this 20?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12426-0
02:15:32.143 --> 02:15:35.991
<v Hou, Eric>So this 20 is really using as a random
number.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12426-1
02:15:35.991 --> 02:15:42.458
<v Hou, Eric>So you gave the algorithm a random #20
and how the algorithm going to use this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12426-2
02:15:42.458 --> 02:15:42.703
<v Hou, Eric>20.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12435-0
02:15:43.583 --> 02:15:47.143
<v Hou, Eric>Remember in in that visualization is.
If you still remember.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12480-0
02:15:48.693 --> 02:15:52.919
<v Hou, Eric>Where is the relaxation.
If you remember that visualization you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12480-1
02:15:52.919 --> 02:15:58.136
<v Hou, Eric>you first choose some random points to
start with and and the random state you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12480-2
02:15:58.136 --> 02:16:03.550
<v Hou, Eric>you gave to the algorithm gonna help the
algorithm decide you know what kind of a</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12480-3
02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:06.653
<v Hou, Eric>starting point,
so then you can choose 20 you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12487-0
02:16:06.653 --> 02:16:07.733
<v Hou, Eric>Can choose 40.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12491-0
02:16:07.853 --> 02:16:09.373
<v Hou, Eric>It's really a random number.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12500-0
02:16:09.373 --> 02:16:14.493
<v Hou, Eric>It does not change anything, however,
with that being said, there are some.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12505-0
02:16:15.303 --> 02:16:17.463
<v Hou, Eric>Caveat or, you know, heads up.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12509-0
02:16:17.973 --> 02:16:19.293
<v Hou, Eric>I have to remind you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12524-0
02:16:21.533 --> 02:16:26.998
<v Hou, Eric>For unsupervised machine learning,
as you can see, the random state is a, a,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12524-1
02:16:26.998 --> 02:16:28.133
<v Hou, Eric>a a factor here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12568-0
02:16:28.803 --> 02:16:32.444
<v Hou, Eric>So then whenever you change this random
state,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12568-1
02:16:32.444 --> 02:16:38.874
<v Hou, Eric>so for example you I change first time I
run 20 and second time I run random state</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12568-2
02:16:38.874 --> 02:16:42.438
<v Hou, Eric>21,
the third time I run random state 22 even</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12568-3
02:16:42.438 --> 02:16:47.783
<v Hou, Eric>though you're running this algorithm on
the same data with the same.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12579-0
02:16:47.783 --> 02:16:53.603
<v Hou, Eric>Number of clusters you may end up with
totally different, for example.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12587-0
02:16:54.383 --> 02:16:57.783
<v Hou, Eric>4 clusters with four with different,
you know.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12593-0
02:16:58.173 --> 02:17:00.133
<v Hou, Eric>Components in those four clusters.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12627-0
02:17:01.783 --> 02:17:05.109
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So that's the really big issue of any</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12627-1
02:17:05.109 --> 02:17:09.321
<v Hou, Eric>machine learning,
especially for this K means the random</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12627-2
02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:12.573
<v Hou, Eric>state in code to 20.
Once you specify that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12627-3
02:17:12.573 --> 02:17:18.263
<v Hou, Eric>If you do provide this this argument to
this function, then state equals 20.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12641-0
02:17:19.983 --> 02:17:24.543
<v Hou, Eric>You can run this function 100 times or
multiple times.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12644-0
02:17:24.543 --> 02:17:26.703
<v Hou, Eric>You still have a static grouping.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12682-0
02:17:27.333 --> 02:17:33.662
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why it's so important to claim
your random state in the machine learning</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12682-1
02:17:33.662 --> 02:17:37.703
<v Hou, Eric>algorithm,
because a lot of our trinkering algorithm</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12682-2
02:17:37.703 --> 02:17:43.573
<v Hou, Eric>includes K means does allow randomness in
in selecting their starting point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12705-0
02:17:45.143 --> 02:17:48.500
<v Hou, Eric>With that a stable a predefined random
state,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12705-1
02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:51.783
<v Hou, Eric>you can reproduce what you have seen
before.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12710-0
02:17:51.943 --> 02:17:56.263
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise,
if you didn't didn't save the model.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12716-0
02:17:57.023 --> 02:17:57.903
<v Hou, Eric>You're going to lose it.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12729-0
02:17:57.903 --> 02:18:02.845
<v Hou, Eric>You're never going to reproduce the model
you have seen in your Jupiter noble in</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12729-1
02:18:02.845 --> 02:18:03.943
<v Hou, Eric>your previous run.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12739-0
02:18:04.173 --> 02:18:08.773
<v Hou, Eric>So it's always good habit to define your
random state OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12749-0
02:18:10.403 --> 02:18:14.123
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm going to run the K means this K
means going to give.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12759-0
02:18:14.123 --> 02:18:17.803
<v Hou, Eric>You give me like the numbers,
for example Apple.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12776-0
02:18:17.803 --> 02:18:22.626
<v Hou, Eric>Does Apple belong to the first bucket or
Apple belong to the second cluster or</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12776-1
02:18:22.626 --> 02:18:24.763
<v Hou, Eric>Apple belongs to the third cluster?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12790-0
02:18:25.243 --> 02:18:32.273
<v Hou, Eric>So I cannot assign those K mean labels
back to my input X or back to my input</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12790-1
02:18:32.273 --> 02:18:32.723
<v Hou, Eric>data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12809-0
02:18:34.263 --> 02:18:40.785
<v Hou, Eric>So I will group all the data I start with
by those clusters from this K means K</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12809-1
02:18:40.785 --> 02:18:42.823
<v Hou, Eric>means analysis I can see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12845-0
02:18:43.723 --> 02:18:48.787
<v Hou, Eric>What their average market access return
beta, what is average?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12845-1
02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:54.735
<v Hou, Eric>Small minus big data? What is average?
High minus low data and what's the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12845-2
02:18:54.735 --> 02:19:00.763
<v Hou, Eric>average market cap data and how many
companies actually in those clusters?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12855-0
02:19:01.003 --> 02:19:04.323
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm showing you I'm going to show you
the results, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12859-0
02:19:04.763 --> 02:19:06.323
<v Hou, Eric>So here are the results and then.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12873-0
02:19:07.863 --> 02:19:11.797
<v Hou, Eric>So I do have 4 buckets and then you know
in computer science,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12873-1
02:19:11.797 --> 02:19:13.383
<v Hou, Eric>let me just redo that so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12877-0
02:19:14.423 --> 02:19:15.263
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe that looks better?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12896-0
02:19:16.823 --> 02:19:20.855
<v Hou, Eric>In computer science,
everything start with a 0 instead of 1.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12896-1
02:19:20.855 --> 02:19:24.423
<v Hou, Eric>So then the cluster 0123 those are the
four clusters.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12924-0
02:19:26.063 --> 02:19:32.773
<v Hou, Eric>So the first cluster,
the average of market access data beta is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12924-1
02:19:32.773 --> 02:19:36.023
<v Hou, Eric>46 and then S MB S MB is -4.16.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12937-0
02:19:36.023 --> 02:19:42.303
<v Hou, Eric>And then hml is .06, market cap is 2.
3 multiplied 10 to the 11th.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12946-0
02:19:42.613 --> 02:19:46.613
<v Hou, Eric>And 36 companies here so that you have
all the data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12956-0
02:19:48.183 --> 02:19:50.943
<v Hou, Eric>For each clusters presenting in front of
you.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12974-0
02:19:52.853 --> 02:19:59.093
<v Hou, Eric>The next step is for human beings to read
those descriptions and and give some.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12983-0
02:20:00.663 --> 02:20:04.423
<v Hou, Eric>You know your interpretation of those
clusters are really talking about.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12985-0
02:20:05.723 --> 02:20:06.443
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/12994-0
02:20:07.983 --> 02:20:09.943
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see those numbers for like maybe
one more minute.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13010-0
02:20:10.423 --> 02:20:18.175
<v Hou, Eric>Can someone really describe what's cost
0123 really are in your plain English</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13010-1
02:20:18.175 --> 02:20:20.063
<v Hou, Eric>instead of numbers?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13012-0
02:20:32.373 --> 02:20:32.853
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13020-0
02:20:35.253 --> 02:20:38.013
<v Hou, Eric>Let's spend one minute just looking at
the table.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13037-0
02:20:38.413 --> 02:20:44.780
<v Hou, Eric>This is the table of how we pulled those
more than 100 stocks and big companies</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13037-1
02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:45.973
<v Hou, Eric>into 4 buckets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13048-0
02:20:47.743 --> 02:20:51.863
<v Hou, Eric>And and how are we going to interpret
those four buckets?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13054-0
02:20:54.823 --> 02:20:56.903
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe let's start with this cluster.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13060-0
02:20:56.903 --> 02:21:01.343
<v Hou, Eric>Zero. How do you describe this bucket 0?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13063-0
02:21:09.603 --> 02:21:09.803
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13076-0
02:21:09.803 --> 02:21:15.263
<v Hou, Eric>Let me ask a question.
Does this one have the highest or lowest</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13076-1
02:21:15.263 --> 02:21:16.883
<v Hou, Eric>market access beta?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13080-0
02:21:18.373 --> 02:21:20.573
<v Benbenek, MATT>It's got the lowest beta.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13087-0
02:21:19.953 --> 02:21:23.713
<v Hou, Eric>OK. And what does market access beta mean?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13095-0
02:21:25.413 --> 02:21:27.733
<v Benbenek, MATT>How it changes relative to the market?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13097-0
02:21:28.353 --> 02:21:28.793
<v Hou, Eric>Exactly.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13124-0
02:21:30.363 --> 02:21:36.886
<v Hou, Eric>And this one this you can pretty much say
that this cluster zero has the lowest</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13124-1
02:21:36.886 --> 02:21:43.083
<v Hou, Eric>sensitivity to the market volatility and
there are 36 companies over there.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13130-0
02:21:44.883 --> 02:21:48.603
<v Hou, Eric>And what about cluster #3?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13136-0
02:21:48.763 --> 02:21:51.803
<v Hou, Eric>It has the highest market access data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13139-0
02:21:51.803 --> 02:21:52.803
<v Hou, Eric>What does it tell you?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13142-0
02:21:57.123 --> 02:21:58.443
<v Benbenek, MATT>It's the most volatile.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13154-0
02:21:59.093 --> 02:22:03.813
<v Hou, Eric>Because most volatile compared to the
market acts of market volatility.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13163-0
02:22:05.363 --> 02:22:07.363
<v Hou, Eric>And what does this mean?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13172-0
02:22:07.403 --> 02:22:11.843
<v Hou, Eric>SMB beta mean tell you so this one is a
little.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13185-0
02:22:14.203 --> 02:22:17.643
<v Hou, Eric>One that is a positive that is a cluster
#2.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13200-0
02:22:18.123 --> 02:22:25.511
<v Hou, Eric>So this one meaning those companies are
correlated to are correlated to the small</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13200-1
02:22:25.511 --> 02:22:28.123
<v Hou, Eric>minus big performance, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13243-0
02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:34.446
<v Hou, Eric>So then likely they could be really
smaller companies and the main market cap</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13243-1
02:22:34.446 --> 02:22:40.368
<v Hou, Eric>is also suggesting that you know this is
really not the least not the smallest,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13243-2
02:22:40.368 --> 02:22:46.289
<v Hou, Eric>but pretty close to the smallest you know,
group of companies and also they are</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13243-3
02:22:46.289 --> 02:22:48.953
<v Hou, Eric>really correlated to high minus low.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13263-0
02:22:48.953 --> 02:22:52.867
<v Hou, Eric>Meaning it could be really close
correlated to that performance.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13263-1
02:22:52.867 --> 02:22:54.793
<v Hou, Eric>This is really how the class #2.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13271-0
02:22:55.603 --> 02:22:58.083
<v Hou, Eric>So the only thing that it remain
unexplained and also.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13280-0
02:22:58.513 --> 02:23:01.633
<v Hou, Eric>Another main market cap is suggesting
this one.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13295-0
02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:06.817
<v Hou, Eric>This group are really big companies
because average market cap is already 7.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13295-1
02:23:06.817 --> 02:23:08.553
<v Hou, Eric>7 multiplied 10 to the 11.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13302-0
02:23:10.123 --> 02:23:13.203
<v Hou, Eric>And this bucket #1 honestly.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13309-0
02:23:13.763 --> 02:23:16.763
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, my gosh. OK,
I need my find my charger.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13332-0
02:23:20.273 --> 02:23:24.773
<v Hou, Eric>This book, the Classer number one,
has the most accompanies,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13332-1
02:23:24.773 --> 02:23:28.313
<v Hou, Eric>but it seems like they don't have they
have OK?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13334-0
02:23:29.883 --> 02:23:30.763
<v Hou, Eric>Market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13337-0
02:23:32.363 --> 02:23:33.483
<v Hou, Eric>Access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13341-0
02:23:35.283 --> 02:23:36.403
<v Hou, Eric>Sensitive they have.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13356-0
02:23:38.203 --> 02:23:42.403
<v Hou, Eric>You know, OK, small minus B, they have.
OK, H -. L.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13376-0
02:23:43.043 --> 02:23:46.656
<v Hou, Eric>So those also they have sort of OK market
tab.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13376-1
02:23:46.656 --> 02:23:52.574
<v Hou, Eric>So those companies could be really the
group of companies that you need more</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13376-2
02:23:52.574 --> 02:23:53.803
<v Hou, Eric>data to analyze.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13388-0
02:23:54.193 --> 02:23:58.313
<v Hou, Eric>But at least we know this cluster 0.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13398-0
02:23:58.393 --> 02:24:01.433
<v Hou, Eric>They are least sensitive to market
volatility.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13419-0
02:24:01.753 --> 02:24:08.103
<v Hou, Eric>This spark cluster #3 they're they're
they're really highly sensitive to market</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13419-1
02:24:08.103 --> 02:24:11.913
<v Hou, Eric>sensitivity and those are big companies,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13439-0
02:24:11.913 --> 02:24:17.182
<v Hou, Eric>And then this cluster #2 there are only
16 companies are really positively</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13439-1
02:24:17.182 --> 02:24:20.553
<v Hou, Eric>correlated and highly positively
correlated to.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13443-0
02:24:21.363 --> 02:24:22.523
<v Hou, Eric>SMB and hml.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13448-0
02:24:24.643 --> 02:24:27.043
<v Hou, Eric>So those are the.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13465-0
02:24:28.603 --> 02:24:32.803
<v Hou, Eric>How you really understand those those
clusters as a human being?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13476-0
02:24:33.083 --> 02:24:37.572
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why when I said OK,
the first time 6, let's not use seven.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13476-1
02:24:37.572 --> 02:24:39.003
<v Hou, Eric>If you chose to use 7.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13485-0
02:24:39.873 --> 02:24:44.193
<v Hou, Eric>Likely you're gonna break this 82 into
another.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13493-0
02:24:45.763 --> 02:24:48.883
<v Hou, Eric>4 clusters and then you can definitely
try after this class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13510-0
02:24:50.173 --> 02:24:55.517
<v Hou, Eric>And then you have to spend more time to
interpret those different clusters and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13510-1
02:24:55.517 --> 02:24:57.613
<v Hou, Eric>putting your definitions right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13517-0
02:24:57.653 --> 02:25:00.013
<v Hou, Eric>There's going to be putting your
definition, but let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13520-0
02:25:02.033 --> 02:25:03.353
<v Hou, Eric>Here is.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13537-0
02:25:04.923 --> 02:25:12.803
<v Hou, Eric>The most 3 frequent sectors per cluster
and an industry for cluster.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13551-0
02:25:13.483 --> 02:25:18.517
<v Hou, Eric>So remember the cluster zero?
We say they are at least sensitivity to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13551-1
02:25:18.517 --> 02:25:19.523
<v Hou, Eric>market access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13555-0
02:25:19.523 --> 02:25:23.723
<v Hou, Eric>Who they are,
there are some financial services.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13569-0
02:25:25.363 --> 02:25:29.854
<v Hou, Eric>Healthcare consumer defensive in terms of
industry,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13569-1
02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:32.963
<v Hou, Eric>they are drug manufacturers general.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13619-0
02:25:33.713 --> 02:25:38.985
<v Hou, Eric>Asset management or asset management
income and then drug manufacturers</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13619-1
02:25:38.985 --> 02:25:43.890
<v Hou, Eric>general and there are 8 consider data in
here. So I will consider,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13619-2
02:25:43.890 --> 02:25:47.405
<v Hou, Eric>yes you know no matter how the market is
going,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13619-3
02:25:47.405 --> 02:25:52.749
<v Hou, Eric>you know people have to buy medications
and then people have to take the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13619-4
02:25:52.749 --> 02:25:54.433

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13636-0
02:25:56.083 --> 02:26:02.186
<v Hou, Eric>Their their their sort of like volatility
proven companies in the market and</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13636-1
02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:04.643
<v Hou, Eric>remember we say the cluster #3.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13652-0
02:26:05.153 --> 02:26:08.982
<v Hou, Eric>They're they're highly,
they are highly sensitive to the market</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13652-1
02:26:08.982 --> 02:26:11.673
<v Hou, Eric>access and they're a big company.
Let's see.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13656-0
02:26:12.313 --> 02:26:13.833
<v Hou, Eric>So their technology.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13662-0
02:26:13.833 --> 02:26:16.333
<v Hou, Eric>Wow,
there are 17 technology companies over</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13662-1
02:26:16.333 --> 02:26:16.673
<v Hou, Eric>there.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13687-0
02:26:18.533 --> 02:26:21.630
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.
So when when when the market grows move</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13687-1
02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:25.758
<v Hou, Eric>up and down South.
Technology companies definitely do that.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13687-2
02:26:25.758 --> 02:26:28.373
<v Hou, Eric>If you can actually seeing that today.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13701-0
02:26:29.883 --> 02:26:32.100
<v Hou, Eric>And the financial services,
the communication services,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13701-1
02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:33.723
<v Hou, Eric>I assume zoom going to be in this bucket.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13720-0
02:26:35.363 --> 02:26:39.849
<v Hou, Eric>And and then for the industries is
semiconductors. All that's 100% correct,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13720-1
02:26:39.849 --> 02:26:40.203
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13722-0
02:26:40.203 --> 02:26:42.603
<v Hou, Eric>So then there's so many policies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13730-0
02:26:44.283 --> 02:26:48.043
<v Hou, Eric>You know from the government going to
affect, you know, the performance.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13737-0
02:26:48.553 --> 02:26:50.113
<v Hou, Eric>Of a semiconductors, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13773-0
02:26:50.113 --> 02:26:54.797
<v Hou, Eric>So then there is, you know,
there is a from a buying administration,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13773-1
02:26:54.797 --> 02:27:00.295
<v Hou, Eric>there is a policy that in favor of those
semiconductors and there is going to be</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13773-2
02:27:00.295 --> 02:27:03.010
<v Hou, Eric>some, some,
some policies prevent those</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13773-3
02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:08.033
<v Hou, Eric>semiconductors to export their their
their products to China for example.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13785-0
02:27:08.193 --> 02:27:11.553
<v Hou, Eric>So then there is definitely going to be
affected by the policy.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13792-0
02:27:11.553 --> 02:27:14.793
<v Hou, Eric>So then their their sensitive to market
and.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13800-0
02:27:15.603 --> 02:27:17.683
<v Hou, Eric>Actually they are part of the market.
So then yes.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13815-0
02:27:18.193 --> 02:27:21.825
<v Hou, Eric>I will say this is yes.
And then usually in those so many years</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13815-1
02:27:21.825 --> 02:27:24.833
<v Hou, Eric>and they're pretty big Internet content
information.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13818-0
02:27:25.073 --> 02:27:26.393
<v Hou, Eric>So then they're definitely big.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13826-0
02:27:28.363 --> 02:27:30.643
<v Hou, Eric>For for cluster #2 right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13844-0
02:27:30.643 --> 02:27:34.464
<v Hou, Eric>So then we say, OK, there,
there's the only one positive to small</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13844-1
02:27:34.464 --> 02:27:35.563
<v Hou, Eric>minds, big and HMO.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13855-0
02:27:35.963 --> 02:27:39.239
<v Hou, Eric>So then what they are,
they are still finance services,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13855-1
02:27:39.239 --> 02:27:40.643
<v Hou, Eric>industries and energies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13871-0
02:27:42.323 --> 02:27:46.205
<v Hou, Eric>I don't have a lot of insight for those
companies, but for for industry,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13871-1
02:27:46.205 --> 02:27:46.843
<v Hou, Eric>their banks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13882-0
02:27:47.433 --> 02:27:53.553
<v Hou, Eric>Diversified aerospace,
defense and financial capital markets.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13887-0
02:27:54.113 --> 02:27:56.273
<v Hou, Eric>I don't have a lot of insight on those.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13898-0
02:27:56.273 --> 02:28:01.221
<v Hou, Eric>I would say maybe yes,
but bucket one is a lot of asset</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13898-1
02:28:01.221 --> 02:28:02.193
<v Hou, Eric>management.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13910-0
02:28:02.193 --> 02:28:06.553
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe they do have some similarity over
there, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13914-0
02:28:06.553 --> 02:28:08.793
<v Hou, Eric>So then further I just create.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13920-0
02:28:08.793 --> 02:28:12.433
<v Hou, Eric>I just see who they are, so I use.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13934-0
02:28:13.243 --> 02:28:16.843
<v Hou, Eric>A technique called PCA,
which we gonna talk in next class.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13939-0
02:28:17.123 --> 02:28:21.123
<v Hou, Eric>What PCA does is remember we have 3
dimensions of data.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13959-0
02:28:21.983 --> 02:28:26.411
<v Hou, Eric>We have this data from associated with
market access return.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13959-1
02:28:26.411 --> 02:28:29.023
<v Hou, Eric>We have this data associated SMS MB.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13964-0
02:28:29.143 --> 02:28:31.423
<v Hou, Eric>We have this data associated with hml.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13982-0
02:28:31.823 --> 02:28:39.303
<v Hou, Eric>So then I cannot project 3 coordinates on
a 2D dimension A2 dimensional plane.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/13989-0
02:28:39.743 --> 02:28:42.143
<v Hou, Eric>So what this PCA does?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14005-0
02:28:42.143 --> 02:28:49.090
<v Hou, Eric>Is it going to convert A3 coordinate
system to 2D so then you can reduce the</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14005-1
02:28:49.090 --> 02:28:50.623
<v Hou, Eric>data into the 2D?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14018-0
02:28:51.233 --> 02:28:55.650
<v Hou, Eric>And I put the company names as labels in
here and then we can actually see who</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14018-1
02:28:55.650 --> 02:28:56.153
<v Hou, Eric>they are.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14020-0
02:28:59.673 --> 02:29:00.073
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14028-0
02:29:01.683 --> 02:29:03.923
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the cluster.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14031-0
02:29:05.923 --> 02:29:06.723
<v Hou, Eric>Which one?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14034-0
02:29:06.723 --> 02:29:07.443
<v Hou, Eric>#3.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14036-0
02:29:07.443 --> 02:29:08.403
<v Hou, Eric>This is a cluster 3.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14050-0
02:29:10.243 --> 02:29:13.200
<v Hou, Eric>Oh,
and then we see cluster one cluster zero,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14050-1
02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:13.843
<v Hou, Eric>cluster 0.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14058-0
02:29:13.963 --> 02:29:16.613
<v Hou, Eric>Who they are,
they are least sensitive to the market</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14058-1
02:29:16.613 --> 02:29:16.963
<v Hou, Eric>access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14067-0
02:29:16.963 --> 02:29:21.523
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see. You follow our expectation,
this one's AT&amp;T.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14078-0
02:29:23.763 --> 02:29:27.242
<v Hou, Eric>Phyllis Morris,
the Progressive Corporation I think,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14078-1
02:29:27.242 --> 02:29:28.883
<v Hou, Eric>is the insurance company.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14092-0
02:29:29.573 --> 02:29:33.265
<v Hou, Eric>McDonald's. Yeah,
I I will say yes when I see McDonald's</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14092-1
02:29:33.265 --> 02:29:33.653
<v Hou, Eric>right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14119-0
02:29:33.653 --> 02:29:36.717
<v Hou, Eric>So then least sensitive to to market,
right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14119-1
02:29:36.717 --> 02:29:40.394
<v Hou, Eric>So then when the we we do have inflation
really high,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14119-2
02:29:40.394 --> 02:29:45.160
<v Hou, Eric>I believe like still have to eat at
McDonald's, right? The Coca-Cola,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14119-3
02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:46.453
<v Hou, Eric>of course, Verizon.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14121-0
02:29:48.153 --> 02:29:48.193
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14123-0
02:29:48.193 --> 02:29:49.353
<v Hou, Eric>Bristol mayors.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14127-0
02:29:51.203 --> 02:29:52.443
<v Hou, Eric>Energy company.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14130-0
02:29:52.523 --> 02:29:52.963
<v Hou, Eric>Oh wow.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14133-0
02:29:52.963 --> 02:29:56.603
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, of course. Pinco vanguard.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14176-0
02:29:58.223 --> 02:30:02.180
<v Hou, Eric>Costco, I mean, yes,
and people still purchase Costco.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14176-1
02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:08.151
<v Hou, Eric>I so from just spot check those company I
consider and those are here and you know</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14176-2
02:30:08.151 --> 02:30:12.108
<v Hou, Eric>Pfizer's of course because we do have
COVID data here,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14176-3
02:30:12.108 --> 02:30:17.143
<v Hou, Eric>although it's kind of strange that you
put fighters and Pepsi and Co.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14181-0
02:30:17.143 --> 02:30:17.823
<v Hou, Eric>Cola together, right?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14190-0
02:30:17.823 --> 02:30:21.223
<v Hou, Eric>But we are using beta to define those
groups so that I think they make sense.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14197-0
02:30:22.403 --> 02:30:24.203
<v Hou, Eric>And classer #2 those are.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14204-0
02:30:24.203 --> 02:30:26.803
<v Hou, Eric>Those are really highly sensitive to the
market access.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14216-0
02:30:27.193 --> 02:30:30.353
<v Hou, Eric>In here and there are big companies
that's chocked the classroom.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14219-0
02:30:30.353 --> 02:30:34.713
<v Hou, Eric>#2 those guys. Micro technology, yes,
applied.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14236-0
02:30:36.643 --> 02:30:40.519
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see. Broadcom. OK,
so whoever who purchased this this</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14236-1
02:30:40.519 --> 02:30:43.813
<v Hou, Eric>company,
this is definitely highly sensitive to to</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14236-2
02:30:43.813 --> 02:30:44.523
<v Hou, Eric>the market.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14245-0
02:30:46.163 --> 02:30:50.283
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So all different, all different.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14250-0
02:30:50.363 --> 02:30:54.723
<v Hou, Eric>Alphabet, Microsoft, Palo Alto networks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14252-0
02:30:56.483 --> 02:30:56.723
<v Hou, Eric>Adobe.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14262-0
02:30:57.433 --> 02:31:01.033
<v Hou, Eric>Netflix, yes, I think that makes sense.
Tesla is here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14281-0
02:31:01.233 --> 02:31:07.114
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a group that really highly
sensitive to the market and they have</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14281-1
02:31:07.114 --> 02:31:09.513
<v Hou, Eric>really big market capital size.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14287-0
02:31:09.513 --> 02:31:11.873
<v Hou, Eric>So then they group them together.
I think that makes sense.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14299-0
02:31:13.483 --> 02:31:19.763
<v Hou, Eric>And this one is positive to, you know,
FML, who they are well.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14302-0
02:31:21.813 --> 02:31:23.173
<v Hou, Eric>Citigroup, those are banks.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14308-0
02:31:24.723 --> 02:31:25.883
<v Hou, Eric>I know I have no comment.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14330-0
02:31:26.003 --> 02:31:29.048
<v Hou, Eric>I don't have a lot of information of the
companies,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14330-1
02:31:29.048 --> 02:31:33.673
<v Hou, Eric>so I'm not sure how they come in that,
but I do see a lot of banks and here is</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14330-2
02:31:33.673 --> 02:31:34.083
<v Hou, Eric>really.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14335-0
02:31:36.443 --> 02:31:37.003
<v Hou, Eric>Nike's here.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14342-0
02:31:37.323 --> 02:31:40.843
<v Hou, Eric>There's a really a group that you need
more data to analyze.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14344-0
02:31:44.483 --> 02:31:44.803
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14350-0
02:31:44.803 --> 02:31:46.163
<v Hou, Eric>So how do you guys feel?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14364-0
02:31:46.163 --> 02:31:50.799
<v Hou, Eric>It is a good a good result for you,
or do you feel like this is now so</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14364-1
02:31:50.799 --> 02:31:51.843
<v Hou, Eric>accurate result?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14369-0
02:31:52.243 --> 02:31:55.003
<v Hou, Eric>Just spell check and what's what's your
feeling about of it?</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14396-0
02:32:02.093 --> 02:32:06.826
<v Teske, Benjamin>One gives good directional analysis.
You might have to dig deeper like into</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14376-0
02:32:03.963 --> 02:32:04.323
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14396-1
02:32:06.826 --> 02:32:10.687
<v Teske, Benjamin>each of the clusters if you really wanna
get further into it,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14396-2
02:32:10.687 --> 02:32:12.493
<v Teske, Benjamin>but it's a good way to begin.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14392-0
02:32:11.083 --> 02:32:11.523
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14400-0
02:32:13.043 --> 02:32:14.163
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. I I I think so.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14401-0
02:32:14.163 --> 02:32:14.203
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14405-0
02:32:14.203 --> 02:32:15.523
<v Hou, Eric>I I have the same feeling right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14415-0
02:32:15.523 --> 02:32:17.345
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
if you really want to do a lot of things</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14415-1
02:32:17.345 --> 02:32:17.563
<v Hou, Eric>right.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14436-0
02:32:17.923 --> 02:32:21.439
<v Hou, Eric>Since you only have,
you only have daily returns and then you</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14436-1
02:32:21.439 --> 02:32:24.786
<v Hou, Eric>only have like 3 numbers per company.
I think it's a good,</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14436-2
02:32:24.786 --> 02:32:26.203
<v Hou, Eric>good good starting point.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14453-0
02:32:26.643 --> 02:32:28.863
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
at least even your boss ask a question</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14453-1
02:32:28.863 --> 02:32:32.532
<v Hou, Eric>like this and then you can give him a a
starting point and then you can buy your</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14453-2
02:32:32.532 --> 02:32:33.483
<v Hou, Eric>time. And to do more.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14471-0
02:32:35.043 --> 02:32:38.460
<v Hou, Eric>I I think that's that's a good,
good answer to your boss and then</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14471-1
02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:39.443
<v Hou, Eric>definitely do more.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14475-0
02:32:41.043 --> 02:32:41.683
<v Hou, Eric>I think it's good.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14478-0
02:32:42.073 --> 02:32:43.073
<v Hou, Eric>Hey, everything is good.</v>

<v Hou, Eric>So so that we introduce one use case of K
means.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14508-0
02:32:46.963 --> 02:32:53.637
<v Hou, Eric>So next time we gonna we gonna do we
gonna use our corporate finance knowledge</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14508-1
02:32:53.637 --> 02:32:56.763
<v Hou, Eric>to see whether or not we can predict.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14513-0
02:32:58.403 --> 02:32:59.643
<v Hou, Eric>Bankrupted companies.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14547-0

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14547-2
02:33:07.529 --> 02:33:09.989
<v Hou, Eric>is.
So those kind of ratios we're gonna use</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14547-3
02:33:09.989 --> 02:33:11.443
<v Hou, Eric>those ratios to determine.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14550-0
02:33:11.753 --> 02:33:13.233
<v Hou, Eric>Whether or not we can tell.</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14554-0
02:33:14.803 --> 02:33:16.003

from Taiwan and then there's a really</v>

157d9973-2793-4083-a135-b06d6f7b2531/14581-1
02:33:23.512 --> 02:33:27.323
<v Hou, Eric>good data to use and then and that's see
what can we can do, right.</v>
