d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/24-0
00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:05.828
<v Hou, Eric>That's correct. OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/28-0
00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:14.448
<v Hou, Eric>Alright, let me share my screen.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/33-0
00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.208
<v Hou, Eric>OK. Can you guys see my screen?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/37-0
00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:24.368
<v Hou, Eric>OK, perfect.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/47-0
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:30.408
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So several logistic reminders.
So homework ready uploaded.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/66-0
00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.833
<v Hou, Eric>Confirm with Professor Wang about,
you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/66-1
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.648
<v Hou, Eric>the last time we talked about the
graduate students, it's really about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/79-0
00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:44.888
<v Hou, Eric>Whoever register for that class, the five,
the class, start with some.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/88-0
00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:49.866
<v Hou, Eric>Digit 5,
so that is considered as a graduate level</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/88-1
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.648
<v Hou, Eric>class. So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/102-0
00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:57.168
<v Hou, Eric>So good news is that you guys will only
have like 1-1 more homework one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/107-0
00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:00.048
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's gonna be more difficult than
the usually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/122-0
00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:03.116
<v Hou, Eric>Then the usual homework that we have so
done,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/122-1
00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:06.878
<v Hou, Eric>but you do not have one additional final
exam, just one more homework.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/133-0
00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:11.933
<v Hou, Eric>So then just wanna make that one more
difficult and then that will be the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/133-1
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.678
<v Hou, Eric>difference.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/152-0
00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:20.194
<v Hou, Eric>But I I cannot really job that homework,
no matter how good or bad that grade will</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/152-1
00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:21.358
<v Hou, Eric>be for you guys.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/164-0
00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.838
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will drop the regular homework,
but not that one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/171-0
00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:28.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then that will be considered the key
difference between this 5.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/179-0
00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:32.878
<v Hou, Eric>Level class versus A4 level class, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/186-0
00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:36.036
<v Hou, Eric>But you know,
good news is you don't have final exam as</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/186-1
00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:36.318
<v Hou, Eric>well.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/192-0
00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.078
<v Hou, Eric>You still do not have that final exam.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/207-0
00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:42.626
<v Hou, Eric>You just have one one more homework and
then I will try my best to pose that</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/207-1
00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:43.158
<v Hou, Eric>homework.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/225-0
00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:49.072
<v Hou, Eric>Before the next class so that you have
entire months to finish it just before</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/225-1
00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:52.248
<v Hou, Eric>the final presentation,
you just turn it in. That's it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/235-0
00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:57.048
<v Hou, Eric>So I I I believe that will be really
doable.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/238-0
00:01:57.128 --> 00:01:58.368
<v Hou, Eric>So there's still no pressure.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/251-0
00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:03.358
<v Hou, Eric>And then enjoy learning machine learning,
OK or AI.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/255-0
00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:06.638
<v Hou, Eric>So I currently have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/271-0
00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:12.957
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a newer network that I already
have 55 slides and then next week I feel</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/271-1
00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:14.518
<v Hou, Eric>I gonna have 100 slides.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/284-0
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:18.848
<v Hou, Eric>Just I just wanna go slow about, you know,
the neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/302-0
00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:24.553
<v Hou, Eric>So then I feel you guys should build a
really solid foundation on understanding</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/302-1
00:02:24.553 --> 00:02:28.618
<v Hou, Eric>the neural network,
because when we talk about the large</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/302-2
00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:29.688
<v Hou, Eric>language model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/304-0
00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:30.398
<v Hou, Eric>ALS.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/313-0
00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:32.918
<v Hou, Eric>At least for the models piece.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/326-0
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:37.228
<v Hou, Eric>Whatever we learn at a neural network,
gonna be the building bricks for large</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/326-1
00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:38.038
<v Hou, Eric>language models.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/337-0
00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:42.558
<v Hou, Eric>Those models are gonna be more and more a
much more complex than neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/353-0
00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.911
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
you once you you learn the large language</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/353-1
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.038
<v Hou, Eric>model,
you go back and see the neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/372-0
00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:50.754
<v Hou, Eric>You feel like, Oh my God,
it's really like arithmetic to you guys,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/372-1
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.638
<v Hou, Eric>although you don't feel so at at this
stage, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/380-0
00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:56.636
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah,
so last time we talked about gradient</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/380-1
00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:58.358
<v Hou, Eric>descent and then I I build.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/391-0
00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:04.452
<v Hou, Eric>Excel model example demonstration about
you know the to graduate great gradient</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/391-1
00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:04.968
<v Hou, Eric>descent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/403-0
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:11.238
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the code of writing a graded
decent in Python, right? So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/417-0
00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.728
<v Hou, Eric>What we did is you just need to get some
initial value.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/420-0
00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:18.408
<v Hou, Eric>The initial value could be whatever value.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/429-0
00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:22.248
<v Hou, Eric>And then you just going to run a loop.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/444-0
00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:27.677
<v Hou, Eric>It's a four loop for for Python or
different loop for different programming</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/444-1
00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:28.328
<v Hou, Eric>languages.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/466-0
00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:32.995
<v Hou, Eric>So then in the loop,
you just need to calculate the derivative</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/466-1
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:37.844
<v Hou, Eric>of the loss function and then you define
your own learning rate and then every</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/466-2
00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:39.808
<v Hou, Eric>time you just refresh your data.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/479-0
00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:47.528
<v Hou, Eric>And then you use your thi that you update
those values until the error is good so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/488-0
00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:50.608
<v Hou, Eric>The Theta is going to assume.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/504-0
00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:55.730
<v Hou, Eric>Optimize your weight so this is how the
gradient were.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/504-1
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.088
<v Hou, Eric>A gradient descent is working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/514-0
00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:02.288
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty powerful tool and then we gonna
use it again today.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/523-0
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:07.768
<v Hou, Eric>So I I I will keep reminding you guys
about gradient gradient descent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/529-0
00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.598
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's a very powerful tool.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/536-0
00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.568
<v Hou, Eric>For neural network,
we're gonna use it a lot of times, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/552-0
00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:20.498
<v Hou, Eric>And then in terms of A use case of the
neural networks,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/552-1
00:04:20.498 --> 00:04:21.968
<v Hou, Eric>and let me just enlarge it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/564-0
00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:26.697
<v Hou, Eric>So then before we are talking about a lot
of things like identification,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/564-1
00:04:26.697 --> 00:04:27.928
<v Hou, Eric>regression but now.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/579-0
00:04:29.688 --> 00:04:32.635
<v Hou, Eric>When we have the neural network,
we have a new applications.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/579-1
00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:33.408
<v Hou, Eric>I'll go trading.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/591-0
00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:36.617
<v Hou, Eric>There's a lot of paper articles about,
you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/591-1
00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:38.888
<v Hou, Eric>using neural networking algorith, meeting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/597-0
00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:40.678
<v Hou, Eric>For example this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/605-0
00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:45.798
<v Hou, Eric>So they use reinforcement learning in in
all go training.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/608-0
00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:48.118
<v Hou, Eric>It's quite powerful.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/615-0
00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:51.278
<v Hou, Eric>And then they they also show in this
article they show.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/617-0
00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:52.918
<v Hou, Eric>Their results?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/633-0
00:04:55.648 --> 00:04:59.314
<v Hou, Eric>The Sr.
is a sharp ratio and the RR percent is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/633-1
00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:00.328
<v Hou, Eric>return ratio.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/641-0
00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:04.168
<v Hou, Eric>So they have 3 strategies to compare
against with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/661-0
00:05:04.168 --> 00:05:11.482
<v Hou, Eric>So first one is is the one that they are
introducing in this articles reinforce</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/661-1
00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:15.688
<v Hou, Eric>reinforcement learning gdqn that is this
one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/667-0
00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:19.888
<v Hou, Eric>And they have a gated deterministic
policy, the gradient.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/669-0
00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:21.408
<v Hou, Eric>So GDP?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/683-0
00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:27.838
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is hurdle and turns out the
turtle strategy is quite interesting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/687-0
00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:31.998
<v Hou, Eric>I provide the article link to here. See.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/693-0
00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:34.768
<v Hou, Eric>Turtle strategy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/708-0
00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:39.128
<v Hou, Eric>Quite, quite interesting that, you know,
I may use it in in the future.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/714-0
00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:42.088
<v Hou, Eric>Here you can definitely find this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/739-0
00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:46.996
<v Hou, Eric>It's a pretty old strategy and they have
some slides introduced.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/739-1
00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:52.734
<v Hou, Eric>This slide strategy is quite easy
strategy to use if you are interested in,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/739-2
00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:54.848
<v Hou, Eric>you can definitely learn it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/741-0
00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:57.338
<v Hou, Eric>Quite easy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/744-0
00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:00.568
<v Hou, Eric>Focus on some, really.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/759-0
00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:07.192
<v Hou, Eric>They they don't focus on,
they don't have a lot of like really</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/759-1
00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:08.008
<v Hou, Eric>fancy technology.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/778-0
00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:13.804
<v Hou, Eric>They just they focus on liquidity and
then that's that's one of the reason they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/778-1
00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:15.688
<v Hou, Eric>they purchase some of the.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/791-0
00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:27.328
<v Hou, Eric>Stocks or or fund or bonds or or or or
commodities, right? So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/798-0
00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:31.288
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's hard to be, not bad.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/821-0
00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:37.515
<v Hou, Eric>The strategy to use and then also these
were article where is it?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/821-1
00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:43.278
<v Hou, Eric>These were article is using this as a
benchmark and then you can also.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/826-0
00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:47.968
<v Hou, Eric>Find this article from archive.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/834-0
00:06:49.978 --> 00:06:50.938
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/846-0
00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:55.018
<v Hou, Eric>This is the the reinforcement learning
algorithm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/847-0
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:58.178
<v Hou, Eric>I'll go trading article so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/865-0
00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:06.193
<v Hou, Eric>They provided a lot of technical details
and then if you're interested in you can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/865-1
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.808
<v Hou, Eric>definitely replicate.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/870-0
00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:12.288
<v Hou, Eric>Whatever they have done,
quite interesting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/882-0
00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:17.372
<v Hou, Eric>Whatever I copy paste from this article
is this very table and then they just do</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/882-1
00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:18.368
<v Hou, Eric>some comparison.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/892-0
00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:24.838
<v Hou, Eric>Their strategy versus the turtle strategy
has a benchmark.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/910-0
00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:31.677
<v Hou, Eric>And then the the data they were using is
2016 to 2019 and just keep that in your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/910-1
00:07:31.677 --> 00:07:32.328
<v Hou, Eric>mind that?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/916-0
00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:35.838
<v Hou, Eric>They selected the data like before COVID.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/920-0
00:07:37.568 --> 00:07:38.848
<v Hou, Eric>Posted COVID.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/935-0
00:07:39.128 --> 00:07:43.715
<v Hou, Eric>I don't think this article gonna say hey,
I I can guarantee that you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/935-1
00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:45.488
<v Hou, Eric>this strategy has still work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/945-0
00:07:46.678 --> 00:07:50.798
<v Hou, Eric>From post to pre COVID result is not bad.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/959-0
00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:57.208
<v Hou, Eric>My APLG IBM those are pretty big
companies.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/978-0
00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:02.408
<v Hou, Eric>And then I think they are doing a pretty
good job on average compared to this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/978-1
00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.808
<v Hou, Eric>turtle strategy, especially for IBM.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/983-0
00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:07.448
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, they have an active return.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1005-0
00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:12.921
<v Hou, Eric>Learn to have an active ritual over this
one managed to have a positive ritual</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1005-1
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:13.878
<v Hou, Eric>which is good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1014-0
00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.988
<v Hou, Eric>But you know, I have done some,
I'll go trading.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1017-0
00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:20.678
<v Hou, Eric>Exercise.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1019-0
00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:23.638
<v Hou, Eric>As per.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1022-0
00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:25.198
<v Hou, Eric>Exploration before.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1030-0
00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:29.158
<v Hou, Eric>Just just be cautious, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1046-0
00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:33.605
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you're gonna use algorithm to
automatically select the stocks that in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1046-1
00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:34.798
<v Hou, Eric>your portfolio, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1064-0
00:08:36.518 --> 00:08:41.514
<v Hou, Eric>You know I when I hold it something to
build my own portfolio and then working</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1064-1
00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:43.158
<v Hou, Eric>with my colleagues before.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1067-0
00:08:43.788 --> 00:08:44.468
<v Hou, Eric>Who is?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1076-0
00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:48.868
<v Hou, Eric>Who is my office made in in my PhD
program?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1086-0
00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:53.668
<v Hou, Eric>We we were coding something for ourselves
and then trying to try to earn some money.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1100-0
00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:58.382
<v Hou, Eric>And then and then, yeah,
we we did call something that is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1100-1
00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:01.068
<v Hou, Eric>providing some pretty good sharp ratio.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1110-0
00:09:03.278 --> 00:09:07.798
<v Hou, Eric>We're trying to compete with against each
other. The funny thing is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1138-0
00:09:09.558 --> 00:09:15.351
<v Hou, Eric>From the back testing, right,
so that you you definitely have back then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1138-1
00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:21.466
<v Hou, Eric>I think some that's a pretty 2022.
I believe when we try to build something</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1138-2
00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:23.558
<v Hou, Eric>and and and the back test.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1174-0
00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:28.279
<v Hou, Eric>Thing is you you just took a time machine
to go back to pre call with period.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1174-1
00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:32.650
<v Hou, Eric>For example 2018 and then you build your
algorithm and then you automatically</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1174-2
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.741
<v Hou, Eric>gonna buy some stocks in in your
portfolio every single day and then the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1174-3
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.198
<v Hou, Eric>machine gonna decide that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1196-0
00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:42.908
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can just mimic what gonna
happen to your portfolio by investing,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1196-1
00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:45.788
<v Hou, Eric>for example, like $10,
000 to start your portfolio.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1202-0
00:09:46.588 --> 00:09:49.108
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
we we we achieved some really good return.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1213-0
00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:53.238
<v Hou, Eric>And then when we review our our our
algorithm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1222-0
00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:55.708
<v Hou, Eric>You're pretty much like the algorithm
telling one thing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1226-0
00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.748
<v Hou, Eric>Just add Tesla to your portfolio.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1245-0
00:09:59.318 --> 00:10:02.518
<v Hou, Eric>And then whenever you add Tesla to your
portfolio, man,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1245-1
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:04.118
<v Hou, Eric>you have really good return.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1268-0
00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:07.001
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if you restrict adding that Tesla to your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1268-1
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:09.585
<v Hou, Eric>portfolio,
it's just basically like commodity.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1268-2
00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:12.718
<v Hou, Eric>This is a normal portfolio and this it
cannot really be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1271-0
00:10:12.718 --> 00:10:13.718
<v Hou, Eric>It's the market.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1289-0
00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:18.233
<v Hou, Eric>I mean,
the Tesla was a really good stocks during</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1289-1
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:21.278
<v Hou, Eric>2020 to 2002 period of time, so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1310-0
00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:27.272
<v Hou, Eric>I think Tesla to your profile gonna be in
all different kind of competing</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1310-1
00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:30.788
<v Hou, Eric>portfolios,
which is not quite surprising for us.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1347-0
00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:37.582
<v Hou, Eric>So just keeping your mind that you,
you you definitely need to have a back</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1347-1
00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:41.439
<v Hou, Eric>test reveal.
Make sure that there's no serious</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1347-2
00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:45.788
<v Hou, Eric>weakness of your portfolio,
because if you you, you,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1347-3
00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:48.988
<v Hou, Eric>you went heavy on on on Tesla and then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1355-0
00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:51.558
<v Hou, Eric>This current quarter gonna be hitting you
a lot.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1374-0
00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:57.755
<v Hou, Eric>Because Tesla declined a lot, right? So,
so but definitely this is the one</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1374-1
00:10:57.755 --> 00:10:59.908
<v Hou, Eric>interesting article to read.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1380-0
00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:02.908
<v Hou, Eric>And then if you guys are are.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1413-0
00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:08.418
<v Hou, Eric>Super crazy with, you know,
coding and building your own found and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1413-1
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:12.527
<v Hou, Eric>then you can definitely try to do this
and then run some back test and see</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1413-2
00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:14.828
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not the algorithm work for you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1440-0
00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:21.867
<v Hou, Eric>But what I know is I feel this this other
just selectively chose this period pre</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1440-1
00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:27.388
<v Hou, Eric>COVID and you know #1 there's no Tesla
that is arriving so fast.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1450-0
00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:32.548
<v Hou, Eric>The pre COVID and #2 is not a big
volatility in the market.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1465-0
00:11:33.448 --> 00:11:38.928
<v Hou, Eric>So this should give you some insight how
to build, how to how to run our goal.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1486-0
00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:42.328
<v Hou, Eric>I'll go trading,
but just be cautious when you when you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1486-1
00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:45.789
<v Hou, Eric>build your own,
especially when you start investing your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1486-2
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.368
<v Hou, Eric>real money. So that'll be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1491-0
00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:51.998
<v Hou, Eric>You know, risky, but it's also fun.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1501-0
00:11:55.388 --> 00:11:58.777
<v Hou, Eric>So yeah,
so then neural network are definitely</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1501-1
00:11:58.777 --> 00:12:00.868
<v Hou, Eric>open doors for outgo trading.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1518-0
00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:08.927
<v Hou, Eric>Another example, this one is is some.
Some folks have the algo trading in in in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1518-1
00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:10.478
<v Hou, Eric>Singaporean market.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1521-0
00:12:10.838 --> 00:12:13.198
<v Hou, Eric>So this is another interesting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1524-0
00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:15.398
<v Hou, Eric>Interesting result.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1544-0
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:21.672
<v Hou, Eric>And then also you can find this article
online and then they they should provide</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1544-1
00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:25.198
<v Hou, Eric>some supercool demonstrated demonstration
of the neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1555-0
00:12:25.628 --> 00:12:29.663
<v Hou, Eric>I build umm, you know,
it looks like a rocket when it's super</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1555-1
00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:29.988
<v Hou, Eric>cool.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1563-0
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.908
<v Hou, Eric>What they did is they actually using.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1578-0
00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:38.504
<v Hou, Eric>They were actually using the daily stock
price data and then they gonna they're</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1578-1
00:12:38.504 --> 00:12:39.308
<v Hou, Eric>gonna predict.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1603-0
00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Hou, Eric>The coming days,
closing price and then and and and and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1603-1
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.418
<v Hou, Eric>two days later closing price and then
five days in the future, right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1623-0
00:12:51.418 --> 00:12:55.663
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so they have the high dependency on on on</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1623-1
00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:59.658
<v Hou, Eric>forecast,
so then their strategy is quite easy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1635-0
00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:02.670
<v Hou, Eric>So it's really like they predict,
for example,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1635-1
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.618
<v Hou, Eric>tomorrow's a close price gonna be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1642-0
00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:08.358
<v Hou, Eric>Gonna be lower than their current cost
price.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1647-0
00:13:08.548 --> 00:13:09.708
<v Hou, Eric>Then they're gonna sell it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1669-0
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:13.519
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise they have different entry rule
12345.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1669-1
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:19.348
<v Hou, Eric>Then that means like if you if I predict
tomorrow close price is actually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1675-0
00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:22.718
<v Hou, Eric>Higher than current price, I'll buy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1710-0
00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:28.767
<v Hou, Eric>Two means two days in your role that
tomorrow and day after tomorrow close</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1710-1
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:33.157
<v Hou, Eric>price gonna be higher than my current
price. I'll buy. So as you can see,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1710-2
00:13:33.157 --> 00:13:36.182
<v Hou, Eric>five days meaning like they they go
really strict.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1710-3
00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.318
<v Hou, Eric>I have 5 days in a row my predicted.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1717-0
00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:41.428
<v Hou, Eric>With close price is higher than my
current price.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1733-0
00:13:41.508 --> 00:13:46.759
<v Hou, Eric>I'll buy this stock whenever I see the
close price lower than my my current</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1733-1
00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.348
<v Hou, Eric>stock price. I'll sell.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1737-0
00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:50.068
<v Hou, Eric>So that's basically their strategy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1741-0
00:13:50.068 --> 00:13:52.548
<v Hou, Eric>Quite, very simple strategy and then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1766-0
00:13:53.868 --> 00:14:00.073
<v Hou, Eric>The good news is I don't know if it's
really like some stocks they they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1766-1
00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:04.468
<v Hou, Eric>selected in Singapore market that is
super stable.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1780-0
00:14:04.948 --> 00:14:09.591
<v Hou, Eric>So then that that's why they can enjoy
such such low meaning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1780-1
00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:11.988
<v Hou, Eric>The mean absolute percent error.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1783-0
00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:14.718
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe that's the reason.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1805-0
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:22.062
<v Hou, Eric>But it seems like if you can of course
right if you can predict the stock price</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1805-1
00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:25.318
<v Hou, Eric>accurately,
you can make a fortune out of it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1807-0
00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:25.958
<v Hou, Eric>And then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1818-0
00:14:26.548 --> 00:14:30.148
<v Hou, Eric>They did so in a sharp ratio equal to 5.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1821-0
00:14:30.148 --> 00:14:31.748
<v Hou, Eric>That's this phenomenon.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1839-0
00:14:31.748 --> 00:14:34.402
<v Hou, Eric>I mean,
I hope they they they they accept</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1839-1
00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:39.331
<v Hou, Eric>investments and then I definitely gonna
invest if they can guarantee like 5-5</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1839-2
00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:40.468
<v Hou, Eric>times sharp ratio.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1861-0
00:14:41.038 --> 00:14:45.131
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty cool.
The article I also recommend as as a read</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1861-1
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:50.118
<v Hou, Eric>As for rating and then so you know a lot
of people are doing this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1880-0
00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:54.872
<v Hou, Eric>I'll go trading and then you can find
some articles and you can definitely try</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1880-1
00:14:54.872 --> 00:14:56.918
<v Hou, Eric>on your own. It's it's definitely.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1884-0
00:14:58.358 --> 00:14:59.238
<v Hou, Eric>A fun thing to try.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1887-0
00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:01.238
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1904-0
00:15:01.278 --> 00:15:04.379
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna take a lot of your time coding
and then,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1904-1
00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:08.878
<v Hou, Eric>but it's definitely gonna be a really
good cool learning process for you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1906-0
00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:09.868
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1910-0
00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:13.118
<v Hou, Eric>I I do love it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1912-0
00:15:15.828 --> 00:15:16.828
<v Hou, Eric>Any questions?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1915-0
00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:23.918
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1917-0
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.038
<v Hou, Eric>No question. Good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1932-0
00:15:26.638 --> 00:15:30.998
<v Hou, Eric>So maybe you wanna ask one question like
why neural computation?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1938-0
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.078
<v Hou, Eric>So people gonna tell you, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1963-0
00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:40.943
<v Hou, Eric>So then the reason we are we are building
those neural networks just to mimic how</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1963-1
00:15:40.943 --> 00:15:43.518
<v Hou, Eric>our human brains are working, right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1968-0
00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:45.598
<v Hou, Eric>The thing they didn't tell you is that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1980-0
00:15:47.358 --> 00:15:52.078
<v Hou, Eric>By converting by learning how the neurons
are working in in human brains. Right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1982-0
00:15:52.388 --> 00:15:52.948
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/1986-0
00:15:54.478 --> 00:15:54.918
<v Hou, Eric>They can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2004-0
00:15:54.918 --> 00:16:01.692
<v Hou, Eric>They can expand those different layers of
neurons to to to to get more and more</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2004-1
00:16:01.692 --> 00:16:02.878
<v Hou, Eric>complex model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2020-0
00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:07.023
<v Hou, Eric>So then you know,
we as as human beings we have,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2020-1
00:16:07.023 --> 00:16:09.678
<v Hou, Eric>we have had and we have a brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2040-0
00:16:09.798 --> 00:16:15.264
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have a certain we have a
certain number of cells in our brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2040-1
00:16:15.264 --> 00:16:18.958
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a restriction for human beings,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2044-0
00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958
<v Hou, Eric>So they you have only as many.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2050-0
00:16:21.588 --> 00:16:23.388
<v Hou, Eric>Neurons in in your brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2089-0
00:16:23.388 --> 00:16:27.346
<v Hou, Eric>So an air building, some network.
So then you can, as a human,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2089-1
00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:31.368
<v Hou, Eric>you you you see you you see some
information you can digest it,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2089-2
00:16:31.368 --> 00:16:34.949
<v Hou, Eric>you can digest information,
you can process information.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2089-3
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:39.724
<v Hou, Eric>You can analyze the information to
eventually whatever you want to have and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2089-4
00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:40.478
<v Hou, Eric>call it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2092-0
00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:41.788
<v Hou, Eric>Output right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2107-0
00:16:41.788 --> 00:16:47.733
<v Hou, Eric>So then another output gonna gonna give
you some guidance to do whatever you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2107-1
00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:48.428
<v Hou, Eric>wanna do.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2113-0
00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:50.388
<v Hou, Eric>So this is how human beings working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2132-0
00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:58.529
<v Hou, Eric>And then how the neural network is
working is I I want to build artificial</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2132-1
00:16:58.529 --> 00:16:59.238
<v Hou, Eric>neurons.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2138-0
00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:02.918
<v Hou, Eric>That is pretty much mimic what the humans.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2151-0
00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:09.958
<v Hou, Eric>Neuron cells are are working in our brain
and then I can connect those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2175-0
00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:15.562
<v Hou, Eric>Basic functions together,
so number one I may be doing like some</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2175-1
00:17:15.562 --> 00:17:22.039
<v Hou, Eric>parallel computation and #2 is you know
those are little functions sitting in the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2175-2
00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:22.908
<v Hou, Eric>RAM, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2198-0
00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:28.499
<v Hou, Eric>Sitting in the ram of a computer and then
and then the humans can can build</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2198-1
00:17:28.499 --> 00:17:31.588
<v Hou, Eric>unlimited unlimited amount of Rams, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2209-0
00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:36.188
<v Hou, Eric>So now for example,
like the HR100H800 chips that you heard</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2209-1
00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:37.108
<v Hou, Eric>from NVIDIA.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2213-0
00:17:37.268 --> 00:17:39.468
<v Hou, Eric>So I can build as many as I want.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2230-0
00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:46.470
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's unlimited in theory.
Theoretically unlimited amount of Rams</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2230-1
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.628
<v Hou, Eric>I'm building.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2244-0
00:17:47.628 --> 00:17:53.388
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm gonna have unlimited amount of
neurons and then I can connect them.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2249-0
00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:56.548
<v Hou, Eric>That'll be much complex eventually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2260-0
00:17:56.548 --> 00:18:00.388
<v Hou, Eric>Right now be much complex than than any
human cell brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2267-0
00:18:00.388 --> 00:18:04.788
<v Hou, Eric>So then that'll be really providing a a
huge computational power.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2274-0
00:18:05.558 --> 00:18:08.998
<v Hou, Eric>To achieve whatever you want to achieve
or whatever that machine.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2284-0
00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:12.108
<v Hou, Eric>Whoever owns that machine wants to
achieve right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2292-0
00:18:12.108 --> 00:18:16.668
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm not gonna provide a lot of
computational computational power.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2309-0
00:18:16.748 --> 00:18:21.628
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not gonna achieve a lot of things
analytics in a more accurate way, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2312-0
00:18:21.628 --> 00:18:24.348
<v Hou, Eric>So the same finance say in healthcare.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2315-0
00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:27.188
<v Hou, Eric>Say it, you know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2328-0
00:18:29.238 --> 00:18:34.758
<v Hou, Eric>Defense saying in design a lot of work
that can be achieved by.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2351-0
00:18:36.678 --> 00:18:41.475
<v Hou, Eric>By figured out how human brains are
working and mimic how human brain is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2351-1
00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:44.958
<v Hou, Eric>working and and building a much powerful
and bigger.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2353-0
00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:46.918
<v Hou, Eric>And.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2356-0
00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:49.638
<v Hou, Eric>Extendable.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2360-0
00:18:51.118 --> 00:18:52.638
<v Hou, Eric>Powers. Right. Upbringings.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2378-0
00:18:53.308 --> 00:18:58.353
<v Hou, Eric>So that's that's the reason why we are
building this and then and then and and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2378-1
00:18:58.353 --> 00:19:00.588
<v Hou, Eric>another way another another reason.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2384-0
00:19:01.998 --> 00:19:04.158
<v Hou, Eric>Beyond those four bullet points is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2410-0
00:19:05.008 --> 00:19:10.926
<v Hou, Eric>And and even though we are building some
super complex uh network of those neurons</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2410-1
00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:16.488
<v Hou, Eric>and then it seems like a human figure out
a way to automate to automatically.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2419-0
00:19:17.878 --> 00:19:20.798
<v Hou, Eric>Optimize how those neurons are working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2430-0
00:19:20.798 --> 00:19:23.921
<v Hou, Eric>So this is some technique we're gonna
talk about in the end of this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2430-1
00:19:23.921 --> 00:19:24.518
<v Hou, Eric>presentation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2436-0
00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.198
<v Hou, Eric>It's called back propagation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2447-0
00:19:27.198 --> 00:19:31.532
<v Hou, Eric>So there's a pretty powerful you can run
in parallel in the pretty fast.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2447-1
00:19:31.532 --> 00:19:32.838
<v Hou, Eric>I mean to some degree.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2461-0
00:19:33.528 --> 00:19:36.664
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty fast and uh,
so then you can learn from whatever</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2461-1
00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:37.168
<v Hou, Eric>happened.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2465-0
00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:39.648
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can you can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2475-0
00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:41.928
<v Hou, Eric>You can make this, umm, artificial.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2477-0
00:19:41.968 --> 00:19:43.088
<v Hou, Eric>Uh. Bring more powerful.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2479-0
00:19:44.598 --> 00:19:45.038
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2502-0
00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:52.360
<v Hou, Eric>I will try to charge based on this
biological part and then you know I'm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2502-1
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.728
<v Hou, Eric>I'm I'm. I didn't buy.
Biology is not my major.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2510-0
00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:57.928
<v Hou, Eric>So then I try my best to touch it,
test them on.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2521-0
00:19:57.928 --> 00:20:01.746
<v Hou, Eric>This is the cortical neuron,
and then the neurons looks like this,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2521-1
00:20:01.746 --> 00:20:02.088
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2541-0
00:20:02.088 --> 00:20:07.661
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have and then you have
connections and they have a synaptic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2541-1
00:20:07.661 --> 00:20:10.448
<v Hou, Eric>knobs and then connected to another.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2545-0
00:20:11.238 --> 00:20:12.278
<v Hou, Eric>Cell right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2552-0
00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.318
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so those are those are connected.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2570-0
00:20:15.668 --> 00:20:20.779
<v Hou, Eric>To the other cells and then this is
really how they transfer those</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2570-1
00:20:20.779 --> 00:20:22.228
<v Hou, Eric>information, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2576-0
00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:26.588
<v Hou, Eric>So then the neurons have a single Axon on
that branches out. So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2586-0
00:20:28.238 --> 00:20:31.678
<v Hou, Eric>Dendritic tree collects input from other
neurons, so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2612-0
00:20:33.438 --> 00:20:37.643
<v Hou, Eric>You those are the little guys connecting,
not the neurons and transfer information,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2612-1
00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:41.097
<v Hou, Eric>and then they gonna digest,
analyze it and then pass the information</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2612-2
00:20:41.097 --> 00:20:41.998
<v Hou, Eric>to another neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2620-0
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.988
<v Hou, Eric>So at least how I understand this, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2623-0
00:20:48.558 --> 00:20:49.398
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2642-0
00:20:51.038 --> 00:20:55.314
<v Hou, Eric>This is this is how biologists really
understand, explore,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2642-1
00:20:55.314 --> 00:20:58.358
<v Hou, Eric>or figured out how the brain works, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2647-0
00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:02.798
<v Hou, Eric>So transfer this into a mathematical way,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2662-0
00:21:04.518 --> 00:21:09.768
<v Hou, Eric>So those dendrites,
those are really the connection to other</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2662-1
00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.198
<v Hou, Eric>dots.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2682-0
00:21:10.768 --> 00:21:15.060
<v Hou, Eric>No matter how you define,
it does say we we have defined some dots</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2682-1
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.968
<v Hou, Eric>over there and then there are some
function. There are some.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2697-0
00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:27.238
<v Hou, Eric>Biological pieces gonna analyze those
thoughts in a process it right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2732-0
00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:31.176
<v Hou, Eric>So then, no matter how we process it,
you gonna process it and then this this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2732-1
00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:34.912
<v Hou, Eric>procession, we just call it a function.
Then no matter how you define the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2732-2
00:21:34.912 --> 00:21:37.386
<v Hou, Eric>function,
it just the function could be identity</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2732-3
00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:40.112
<v Hou, Eric>function you,
meaning you didn't do anything about it</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2732-4
00:21:40.112 --> 00:21:40.718
<v Hou, Eric>or you just.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2748-0
00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:46.078
<v Hou, Eric>Let's say you just plus one to it,
but you just add something to it, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2754-0
00:21:46.078 --> 00:21:48.598
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then you, you, you you pass.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2761-0
00:21:49.238 --> 00:21:50.838
<v Hou, Eric>The process the data to another neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2769-0
00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:52.228
<v Hou, Eric>So that's how it works.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2788-0
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:57.851
<v Hou, Eric>And then how how how it works as a part
of the system and then every single</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2788-1
00:21:57.851 --> 00:22:00.588
<v Hou, Eric>system, every piece of a system is a.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2807-0
00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:04.812
<v Hou, Eric>It's a cell.
Looks like this on in in our brain. OK,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2807-1
00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:10.710
<v Hou, Eric>you can definitely read this this
introduction of how these kind of cells</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2807-2
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.348
<v Hou, Eric>working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2815-0
00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:15.358
<v Hou, Eric>And this is exactly how this synaptic.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2824-0
00:22:17.358 --> 00:22:20.118
<v Hou, Eric>Synapses really transferring those those
information.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2828-0
00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:22.248
<v Hou, Eric>You definitely have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2844-0
00:22:23.918 --> 00:22:27.318
<v Hou, Eric>This is this is from the previous neuron,
is from another neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2847-0
00:22:27.518 --> 00:22:29.678
<v Hou, Eric>So then those are the cells.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2864-0
00:22:29.678 --> 00:22:33.953
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the pieces with information,
and they're gonna pass this information</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2864-1
00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.118
<v Hou, Eric>through the synaptic gap to another one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2888-0
00:22:36.118 --> 00:22:43.014
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will have some of the access
and eventually through this gap and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2888-1
00:22:43.014 --> 00:22:48.358
<v Hou, Eric>have like a synaptic neurons and then I
gonna analyze it and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2892-0
00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:50.598
<v Hou, Eric>Then this AXA high eventually gonna be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2899-0
00:22:51.588 --> 00:22:53.388
<v Hou, Eric>Some different values.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2908-0
00:22:54.028 --> 00:22:58.382
<v Hou, Eric>I call it the eye,
but sometimes this ZI is actually ZJ is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2908-1
00:22:58.382 --> 00:22:59.268
<v Hou, Eric>actually XI.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2917-0
00:22:59.988 --> 00:23:04.268
<v Hou, Eric>It may or may not change those
information, right? So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2922-0
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.108
<v Hou, Eric>This is really how.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2943-0
00:23:11.718 --> 00:23:17.083
<v Hou, Eric>The the cells in our brain works.
Some questions like what rules govern the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2943-1
00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:18.918
<v Hou, Eric>synapses decide to change.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2944-0
00:23:19.238 --> 00:23:20.158
<v Hou, Eric>Not sure.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2982-0
00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:25.367
<v Hou, Eric>In mathematics,
like we can prove some some theories,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2982-1
00:23:25.367 --> 00:23:30.399
<v Hou, Eric>but not sure like how biologically they
decide what kind of information they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2982-2
00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:34.058
<v Hou, Eric>decide to change.
They decide to pass I I guess this is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2982-3
00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:39.351
<v Hou, Eric>really like the human decided and how the
human really give the comment to those</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2982-4
00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:39.678
<v Hou, Eric>cell.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/2994-0
00:23:39.988 --> 00:23:45.268
<v Hou, Eric>The transfer information I do not know,
maybe some new biological.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3019-0
00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:51.229
<v Hou, Eric>Articles really suggest the way how they
make the decisions,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3019-1
00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:57.250
<v Hou, Eric>but this is really how different neurons
are transferring from information from</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3019-2
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.078
<v Hou, Eric>each other.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3068-0
00:24:00.668 --> 00:24:05.945
<v Hou, Eric>And since we can have one neuron
connected another neuron and transferring</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3068-1
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:10.027
<v Hou, Eric>neur information,
so then we can really build some neural</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3068-2
00:24:10.027 --> 00:24:13.827
<v Hou, Eric>computation.
Just looks like this is like a number of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3068-3
00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:19.174
<v Hou, Eric>neurons connecting to each other,
and then you just have a figure out a way</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3068-4
00:24:19.174 --> 00:24:19.878
<v Hou, Eric>to to vis.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3073-0
00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:21.628
<v Hou, Eric>It and just look like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3096-0
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:26.166
<v Hou, Eric>So each neuron received the information
from other neurons,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3096-1
00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:29.621
<v Hou, Eric>and it's really a network.
And then we gonna have a network working</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3096-2
00:24:29.621 --> 00:24:30.078
<v Hou, Eric>together.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3122-0
00:24:31.948 --> 00:24:36.762
<v Hou, Eric>It's sort of like a tree,
but the difference to a tree is you you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3122-1
00:24:36.762 --> 00:24:40.920
<v Hou, Eric>have a starting point and so many data
that you need to,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3122-2
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.108
<v Hou, Eric>and eventually you have a one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3132-0
00:24:43.188 --> 00:24:47.908
<v Hou, Eric>Outcome so that is a sort of inverse of,
umm, of a tree.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3153-0
00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:52.442
<v Hou, Eric>And then the cortical neurons are
communicating using spikes,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3153-1
00:24:52.442 --> 00:24:55.278
<v Hou, Eric>and then the spikes are really
transferring information.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3175-0
00:24:57.408 --> 00:25:03.488
<v Hou, Eric>And then the impact of the neurons is due
is determined by a thing called a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3175-1
00:25:03.488 --> 00:25:04.768
<v Hou, Eric>synaptic weight.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3191-0
00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:10.179
<v Hou, Eric>And then we do have some mathematical
representation of the synaptic weights,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3191-1
00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:12.728
<v Hou, Eric>and then I I will talk about that later.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3220-0
00:25:14.198 --> 00:25:19.553
<v Hou, Eric>So then with those synaptic weight.
So then through this network of neurons</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3220-1
00:25:19.553 --> 00:25:25.189
<v Hou, Eric>in our brain, so human beings can do,
can understanding different languages can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3220-2
00:25:25.189 --> 00:25:26.598
<v Hou, Eric>learn new languages.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3228-0
00:25:27.388 --> 00:25:30.308
<v Hou, Eric>Can can recognize numbers, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3242-0
00:25:30.308 --> 00:25:33.341
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
no matter how the other humans are</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3242-1
00:25:33.341 --> 00:25:37.408
<v Hou, Eric>writing a same number,
you can recognize that it's kind of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3242-2
00:25:37.408 --> 00:25:38.028
<v Hou, Eric>powerful.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3257-0
00:25:38.148 --> 00:25:43.575
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can communicate your your
idea with the other people with other</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3257-1
00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.068
<v Hou, Eric>people.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3263-0
00:25:44.068 --> 00:25:46.188
<v Hou, Eric>So then they still understand what you're
talking about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3273-0
00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:48.748
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, for example, I have my handwriting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3284-0
00:25:48.748 --> 00:25:52.136
<v Hou, Eric>I just write it down and then you guys
can read it and you can understand what</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3284-1
00:25:52.136 --> 00:25:52.908
<v Hou, Eric>I'm talking about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3303-0
00:25:53.548 --> 00:25:57.391
<v Hou, Eric>I'm teaching you guys because I'm
speaking English and then you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3303-1
00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.708
<v Hou, Eric>my English is imperfect.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3338-0
00:25:58.708 --> 00:26:03.395
<v Hou, Eric>But still you can can sort of understand
what I'm talking about to digest like</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3338-1
00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:08.082
<v Hou, Eric>those kind of languages I'm using and
also even and and also you you travel to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3338-2
00:26:08.082 --> 00:26:12.828
<v Hou, Eric>different countries for example like me,
you travel to the country of Colombia.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3342-0
00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:14.108
<v Hou, Eric>I I don't speak.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3348-0
00:26:14.588 --> 00:26:18.348
<v Hou, Eric>I don't speak Spanish,
but you know with my.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3354-0
00:26:19.198 --> 00:26:19.998
<v Hou, Eric>Extremely poor Spanish.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3360-0
00:26:19.998 --> 00:26:22.638
<v Hou, Eric>I can still call and call communicate
with other people.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3373-0
00:26:23.308 --> 00:26:27.167
<v Hou, Eric>In Colombia? Well,
they they pretend to understand what I'm</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3373-1
00:26:27.167 --> 00:26:28.068
<v Hou, Eric>talking about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3374-0
00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:29.348
<v Hou, Eric>They're they're kind people.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3377-0
00:26:30.878 --> 00:26:31.438
<v Hou, Eric>But you know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3381-0
00:26:33.078 --> 00:26:34.598
<v Hou, Eric>People have like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3419-0
00:26:35.688 --> 00:26:39.009
<v Hou, Eric>Humans have different human habits,
not working neurons.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3419-1
00:26:39.009 --> 00:26:42.738
<v Hou, Eric>And then although they receive some
information the the weight,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3419-2
00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:47.573
<v Hou, Eric>the weight in your brain gonna tell them
what they should be focusing on when they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3419-3
00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:49.088
<v Hou, Eric>should not be focusing on.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3427-0
00:26:49.198 --> 00:26:52.872
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
even though I I I tell them I speak in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3427-1
00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:53.638
<v Hou, Eric>super Bad.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3431-0
00:26:53.918 --> 00:26:55.398
<v Hou, Eric>Super bad Spanish.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3442-0
00:26:55.838 --> 00:27:00.038
<v Hou, Eric>And they still know some of the words in
my sentence.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3461-0
00:27:00.038 --> 00:27:06.041
<v Hou, Eric>They want to focus on so then they sort
of understand what I'm talking about with</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3461-1
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.798
<v Hou, Eric>some degree of accuracy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3469-0
00:27:07.838 --> 00:27:11.958
<v Hou, Eric>So then if you can replyn,
Nick can give me a response, right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3479-0
00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:17.558
<v Hou, Eric>So then the wait in your brain,
you don't know that because you just.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3482-0
00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:18.608
<v Hou, Eric>Digest information.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3504-0
00:27:19.038 --> 00:27:23.639
<v Hou, Eric>And and analyze and information and
eventually give you output like in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3504-1
00:27:23.639 --> 00:27:26.814
<v Hou, Eric>millisecond.
But eventually there are still some</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3504-2
00:27:26.814 --> 00:27:28.758
<v Hou, Eric>processing in your brain that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3516-0
00:27:29.158 --> 00:27:35.038
<v Hou, Eric>Required is kind of synaptic weight to do
their job right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3519-0
00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:38.198
<v Hou, Eric>So then definitely with this kind of
network?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3561-0
00:27:38.598 --> 00:27:42.849
<v Hou, Eric>They enjoy scalability and efficiency
like what I said,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3561-1
00:27:42.849 --> 00:27:47.934
<v Hou, Eric>you can always add neurons to it and to
make it bigger and bigger,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3561-2
00:27:47.934 --> 00:27:54.006
<v Hou, Eric>arguably bigger not of a neural network
is definitely getting more accuracy and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3561-3
00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:59.699
<v Hou, Eric>then getting more and more powerful.
And you can analyze more information,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3561-4
00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:00.458
<v Hou, Eric>right? So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3569-0
00:28:00.448 --> 00:28:01.718
<v Hou, Eric>Then you have like billions.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3576-0
00:28:01.718 --> 00:28:04.798
<v Hou, Eric>You can have a billions of neurons and
then you have like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3583-0
00:28:05.568 --> 00:28:08.048
<v Hou, Eric>Thousands of billions of weights because
it's really.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3591-0
00:28:08.398 --> 00:28:10.998
<v Hou, Eric>Combinations of, umm. Of neurons, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3615-0
00:28:10.998 --> 00:28:15.431
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's just make it super
powerful. Uh, as you can imagine,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3615-1
00:28:15.431 --> 00:28:19.278
<v Hou, Eric>that's why uh open AI introducing the
larger on the model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3625-0
00:28:19.278 --> 00:28:23.518
<v Hou, Eric>They always say, OK,
I have so many billions of parameters.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3640-0
00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:29.634
<v Hou, Eric>So then in your network we we have some
of hundreds of 1000 parameters and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3640-1
00:28:29.634 --> 00:28:30.398
<v Hou, Eric>they have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3657-0
00:28:31.888 --> 00:28:34.175
<v Hou, Eric>10,
000 of each 100 chips and they can build</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3657-1
00:28:34.175 --> 00:28:35.648
<v Hou, Eric>a much bigger neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3659-0
00:28:35.728 --> 00:28:36.928
<v Hou, Eric>So then they can have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3667-0
00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:39.918
<v Hou, Eric>Billions of billions of weights.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3675-0
00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:44.558
<v Hou, Eric>So make their model more and more
accurate, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3683-0
00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:48.638
<v Hou, Eric>So let me just give you 1 visualization
of a neural network so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3694-0
00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:51.398
<v Hou, Eric>To to give you the points of this right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3710-0
00:28:51.638 --> 00:28:58.057
<v Hou, Eric>So this is one thing I really like is a
Tensorflow Tensorflow neural network</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3710-1
00:28:58.057 --> 00:28:59.558
<v Hou, Eric>playground, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3720-0
00:28:59.558 --> 00:29:02.758
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just start with from the
beginning, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3721-0
00:29:02.758 --> 00:29:05.038
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's say.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3727-0
00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:07.808
<v Hou, Eric>Start with something really easy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3730-0
00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:09.048
<v Hou, Eric>I have X1.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3738-0
00:29:09.048 --> 00:29:11.728
<v Hou, Eric>I have X2 so this is already my input.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3744-0
00:29:11.728 --> 00:29:14.008
<v Hou, Eric>We are X1 could be my X axis.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3746-0
00:29:14.568 --> 00:29:16.008
<v Hou, Eric>X2 is already mine.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3764-0
00:29:16.958 --> 00:29:23.118
<v Hou, Eric>Y axis and what I'm trying to do is I
have a group of orange dots.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3768-0
00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:25.118
<v Hou, Eric>I have another group of blue dots.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3778-0
00:29:25.828 --> 00:29:30.268
<v Hou, Eric>How can I separate them right?
So then this is really the problem?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3794-0
00:29:31.768 --> 00:29:36.448
<v Hou, Eric>And then I can say ratio of training data
to test data and then say it's.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3801-0
00:29:38.208 --> 00:29:40.688
<v Hou, Eric>70% right. So then I have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3818-0
00:29:42.528 --> 00:29:46.160
<v Hou, Eric>Higher,
more training data I can have the batch</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3818-1
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.808
<v Hou, Eric>size equal to 60 and let's do that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3819-0
00:29:49.208 --> 00:29:50.008
<v Hou, Eric>So OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3832-0
00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:53.688
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm trying to say, hey,
I just have X1X2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3835-0
00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:54.608
<v Hou, Eric>I want to separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3840-0
00:29:55.718 --> 00:29:57.598
<v Hou, Eric>It should be easy, right? Because.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3858-0
00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:02.841
<v Hou, Eric>As for human being,
you draw a line between those like this,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3858-1
00:30:02.841 --> 00:30:05.928
<v Hou, Eric>so you can separate them so they can just
kick this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3867-0
00:30:07.768 --> 00:30:10.528
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you can see this test loss?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3874-0
00:30:12.168 --> 00:30:13.248
<v Hou, Eric>The test loss is 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3898-0
00:30:13.288 --> 00:30:19.814
<v Hou, Eric>So then you perfectly separate this this
set of and this set of blue dogs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3898-1
00:30:19.814 --> 00:30:25.208
<v Hou, Eric>Perfect ausa's gonna show test data and
test it is like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3902-0
00:30:25.718 --> 00:30:26.958
<v Hou, Eric>Awesome, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3911-0
00:30:27.118 --> 00:30:31.198
<v Hou, Eric>So now let's move into more complex
problem.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3916-0
00:30:31.198 --> 00:30:32.438
<v Hou, Eric>That's a separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3927-0
00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:36.958
<v Hou, Eric>As for a human right,
so this is not hard job to do either.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3939-0
00:30:36.958 --> 00:30:40.558
<v Hou, Eric>So then you just this is sort of like a
two by two matrix, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3941-0
00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:41.798
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can separate them.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3944-0
00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:43.888
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3954-0
00:30:43.888 --> 00:30:47.088
<v Hou, Eric>We can, if we only know X&amp;Y axis,
how we separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3963-0
00:30:50.468 --> 00:30:54.028
<v Hou, Eric>You see some light color here,
but it's really generating the colors.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3971-0
00:30:55.408 --> 00:30:57.168
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see, you only have XY.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3994-0
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:02.635
<v Hou, Eric>Coordinates you.
You can either draw a line like this or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/3994-1
00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:05.768
<v Hou, Eric>draw a line like this.
Or you could draw a line like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4011-0
00:31:05.768 --> 00:31:10.842
<v Hou, Eric>So you'll pretty much have 1/2 of the
points are unclassified or half the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4011-1
00:31:10.842 --> 00:31:13.928
<v Hou, Eric>points misclassified,
which is not so great.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4028-0
00:31:13.928 --> 00:31:18.423
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just stop it and show test data so
that you don't have a way to separate</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4028-1
00:31:18.423 --> 00:31:21.288
<v Hou, Eric>those and then it's a test loss and
training loss.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4034-0
00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:22.758
<v Hou, Eric>It's always .5.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4040-0
00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:25.958
<v Hou, Eric>That means you miss 50% of the data.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4062-0
00:31:26.278 --> 00:31:33.210
<v Hou, Eric>So that means like using only like X1X2
as the two features to do this work is is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4062-1
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.478
<v Hou, Eric>extremely hard.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4070-0
00:31:35.398 --> 00:31:39.078
<v Hou, Eric>So then what we can do is OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4083-0
00:31:39.078 --> 00:31:43.558
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just create one more feature like
X1X2 to do this work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4090-0
00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:47.518
<v Hou, Eric>So if you know X1X2 looks like this X1X2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4101-0
00:31:48.168 --> 00:31:51.248
<v Hou, Eric>The the the multiplication of X1X2 gonna
be exactly like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4137-0
00:31:51.438 --> 00:31:54.793
<v Hou, Eric>Yes.
So you now start having a feeling that</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4137-1
00:31:54.793 --> 00:32:00.055
<v Hou, Eric>with those 3 features together,
it should be easy to separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4137-2
00:32:00.055 --> 00:32:04.478
<v Hou, Eric>And then as you can see,
your gas is 100% correct, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4156-0
00:32:04.918 --> 00:32:07.886
<v Hou, Eric>So that you have task laws like less than
1%,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4156-1
00:32:07.886 --> 00:32:12.918
<v Hou, Eric>you show the test data and then you
pretty much follow the same distribution.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4159-0
00:32:13.318 --> 00:32:14.758
<v Hou, Eric>You know this is correct.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4163-0
00:32:14.798 --> 00:32:17.278
<v Hou, Eric>And then from this you can see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4171-0
00:32:18.048 --> 00:32:20.528
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty much this XY coordinates are not
helping.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4190-0
00:32:21.378 --> 00:32:27.382
<v Hou, Eric>The only the the main,
the main feature that driving is nearly</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4190-1
00:32:27.382 --> 00:32:31.098
<v Hou, Eric>perfect result is this product of X1X2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4200-0
00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:34.098
<v Hou, Eric>Let us even get rid of X1X2 separately.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4202-0
00:32:34.098 --> 00:32:35.058
<v Hou, Eric>Let us run this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4210-0
00:32:36.908 --> 00:32:38.628
<v Hou, Eric>See that is to prove my point.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4214-0
00:32:38.788 --> 00:32:40.828
<v Hou, Eric>You have this multiplication together.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4227-0
00:32:40.828 --> 00:32:46.148
<v Hou, Eric>You can have a nearly perfect prediction
and classification of those tasks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4227-1
00:32:46.148 --> 00:32:46.708
<v Hou, Eric>Here OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4231-0
00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:47.468
<v Hou, Eric>That's awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4244-0
00:32:47.828 --> 00:32:52.924
<v Hou, Eric>So then we move from here to here by
adding one feature that can solve the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4244-1
00:32:52.924 --> 00:32:53.468
<v Hou, Eric>problem.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4256-0
00:32:53.788 --> 00:32:58.068
<v Hou, Eric>And now let's just moving one layer of
difficulty level.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4261-0
00:32:58.068 --> 00:33:00.428
<v Hou, Eric>So then let's say we we gonna separate
this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4294-0
00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:04.582
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
this is getting really hard because As</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4294-1
00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:08.056
<v Hou, Eric>for a human being,
we know that you you need to draw a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4294-2
00:33:08.056 --> 00:33:12.034
<v Hou, Eric>circle around this blue.
The set of blue dogs and then you can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4294-3
00:33:12.034 --> 00:33:15.191
<v Hou, Eric>separate them.
Let's say if we only have X1X2 and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4294-4
00:33:15.191 --> 00:33:16.328
<v Hou, Eric>multiplication of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4313-0
00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:19.716
<v Hou, Eric>Those,
it'll be really hard to separate them.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4313-1
00:33:19.716 --> 00:33:25.313
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see it is it is difficult
because doing this, no matter how how,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4313-2
00:33:25.313 --> 00:33:25.608
<v Hou, Eric>how.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4323-0
00:33:26.528 --> 00:33:28.779
<v Hou, Eric>Hard.
You're doing this work and then assigning</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4323-1
00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:30.608
<v Hou, Eric>different weights. You're missing like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4340-0
00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:36.518
<v Hou, Eric>Less than 50% of the dots,
without being correctly classified. OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4349-0
00:33:36.878 --> 00:33:40.362
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then we can follow the similar idea as</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4349-1
00:33:40.362 --> 00:33:41.318
<v Hou, Eric>before, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4351-0
00:33:41.318 --> 00:33:42.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then we may think.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4366-0
00:33:42.678 --> 00:33:45.958
<v Hou, Eric>This X1X2 and X1X2 are not sufficient.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4367-0
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:47.238
<v Hou, Eric>That is great.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4385-0
00:33:49.008 --> 00:33:52.256
<v Hou, Eric>Umm 2 more features X1 squared and X2
square.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4385-1
00:33:52.256 --> 00:33:54.728
<v Hou, Eric>Introducing some nonlinearity here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4387-0
00:33:55.278 --> 00:33:56.238
<v Hou, Eric>I see this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4391-0
00:34:00.048 --> 00:34:00.808
<v Hou, Eric>Boom, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4405-0
00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:07.717
<v Hou, Eric>So then and then adding more features
always help you to to achieve the goal,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4405-1
00:34:07.717 --> 00:34:08.248
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4413-0
00:34:08.248 --> 00:34:09.288
<v Hou, Eric>So then here's the task.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4418-0
00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:14.808
<v Hou, Eric>Data is is correctly classified after
1000.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4422-0
00:34:16.168 --> 00:34:16.848
<v Hou, Eric>Pretty good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4434-0
00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:22.728
<v Hou, Eric>And then the MIS classified data is less
than 1% chance.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4442-0
00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:26.968
<v Hou, Eric>So I I think there's a really good result,
really good, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4451-0
00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:31.534
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then that's let's do the last one,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4451-1
00:34:31.534 --> 00:34:32.408
<v Hou, Eric>this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4460-0
00:34:33.358 --> 00:34:36.878
<v Hou, Eric>This one gonna be really hard, right?
So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4484-0
00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:42.471
<v Hou, Eric>Even for a human being,
how we separate those you have to draw</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4484-1
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:47.116
<v Hou, Eric>these circles around here to separate
those two side of two set of points,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4484-2
00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:47.488
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4498-0
00:34:47.488 --> 00:34:51.204
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's just who those things
together and see whether or not you can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4498-1
00:34:51.204 --> 00:34:51.928
<v Hou, Eric>separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4502-0
00:34:52.608 --> 00:34:53.488
<v Hou, Eric>Apparently no.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4510-0
00:34:54.608 --> 00:35:02.808
<v Hou, Eric>With all those features we have tried
before, they give you .5 loss, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4529-0
00:35:03.158 --> 00:35:07.573
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just follow our previous
thought, then just add more features,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4529-1
00:35:07.573 --> 00:35:10.718
<v Hou, Eric>signals, sign,
see whether or not it gonna help us.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4534-0
00:35:15.078 --> 00:35:18.358
<v Hou, Eric>It doesn't seem to help, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4547-0
00:35:18.838 --> 00:35:24.398
<v Hou, Eric>So then it just show that you know,
then you just wait and you just training.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4552-0
00:35:28.608 --> 00:35:29.128
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4563-0
00:35:29.328 --> 00:35:32.608
<v Hou, Eric>We're sort of convinced that is it's not
helping us.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4570-0
00:35:32.888 --> 00:35:37.488
<v Hou, Eric>The loss is even bigger than .5.
It's not helpful.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4599-0
00:35:37.648 --> 00:35:43.417
<v Hou, Eric>So then it just make up feel,
feel like adding more features and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4599-1
00:35:43.417 --> 00:35:49.763
<v Hou, Eric>there is only so many functions that we
can try and we already tried squared</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4599-2
00:35:49.763 --> 00:35:52.648
<v Hou, Eric>polynomial function. We tried X1X2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4611-0
00:35:53.448 --> 00:35:57.513
<v Hou, Eric>And sine function we can add a whole sign,
but you know eventually it won't move the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4611-1
00:35:57.513 --> 00:35:57.848
<v Hou, Eric>needle.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4617-0
00:35:58.558 --> 00:35:59.958
<v Hou, Eric>We can try the log function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4621-0
00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.278
<v Hou, Eric>It won't help so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4631-0
00:36:06.868 --> 00:36:09.188
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's really not helping, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4641-0
00:36:09.188 --> 00:36:15.108
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then that's the bottleneck we
are facing before to separate those dots.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4648-0
00:36:15.108 --> 00:36:18.148
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe you you feel like why are we?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4654-0
00:36:18.148 --> 00:36:19.428
<v Hou, Eric>Why do we have to separate those thoughts?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4661-0
00:36:19.428 --> 00:36:22.148
<v Hou, Eric>OK, this is 1 extreme example right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4669-0
00:36:22.148 --> 00:36:25.388
<v Hou, Eric>Something in real life you may you may
not even able to see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4682-0
00:36:26.808 --> 00:36:29.288
<v Hou, Eric>Those dots, those, those,
those target you want to classify, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4690-0
00:36:29.288 --> 00:36:32.848
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is good example that you can
at least see it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4694-0
00:36:33.048 --> 00:36:35.688
<v Hou, Eric>So let's see if we just start with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4712-0
00:36:36.238 --> 00:36:43.638
<v Hou, Eric>X1X2 those initial features and XY
coordinates, can we just add maybe one?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4728-0
00:36:45.128 --> 00:36:48.688
<v Hou, Eric>Add some neurons to do some exercise to
help us separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4731-0
00:36:48.808 --> 00:36:50.408
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe we should try this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4770-0
00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:54.684
<v Hou, Eric>So we can just add 1 hidden layer and
then there is 2 neurons,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4770-1
00:36:54.684 --> 00:36:59.996
<v Hou, Eric>so then no's gonna be some functions,
some basic functions that we gonna touch</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4770-2
00:36:59.996 --> 00:37:04.568
<v Hou, Eric>base later. They're gonna.
They're gonna do some calculations here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4776-0
00:37:05.358 --> 00:37:07.598
<v Hou, Eric>Here, remember we only rely on Axon 1X2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4783-0
00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:09.318
<v Hou, Eric>We cannot separate those two points.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4788-0
00:37:09.318 --> 00:37:12.878
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just add 11 hidden layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4804-0
00:37:13.078 --> 00:37:18.917
<v Hou, Eric>Once some functions in between and then
the metric is we are starting getting to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4804-1
00:37:18.917 --> 00:37:19.998
<v Hou, Eric>separate those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4823-0
00:37:20.318 --> 00:37:23.485
<v Hou, Eric>Remember,
in a previous exercise we we have the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4823-1
00:37:23.485 --> 00:37:27.444
<v Hou, Eric>test loss equals .
5 and this this one we can separate some</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4823-2
00:37:27.444 --> 00:37:28.038
<v Hou, Eric>of those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4836-0
00:37:28.618 --> 00:37:35.298
<v Hou, Eric>And then this loss is much smaller than
than without this layer, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4844-0
00:37:36.768 --> 00:37:38.808
<v Hou, Eric>And and that's why how we mimic it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4851-0
00:37:39.638 --> 00:37:42.678
<v Hou, Eric>So let's maybe add more neurons in here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4855-0
00:37:44.538 --> 00:37:45.218
<v Hou, Eric>No, it's on.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4882-0
00:37:57.518 --> 00:38:02.269
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
it's trying its best to to mimic umm to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4882-1
00:38:02.269 --> 00:38:08.038
<v Hou, Eric>mimic the region here and then we have.
We only use the two impose.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4907-0
00:38:08.238 --> 00:38:15.574
<v Hou, Eric>That we know XY coordinates and you can
just achieve like this amount of MIS</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4907-1
00:38:15.574 --> 00:38:18.718
<v Hou, Eric>misclassification, which is good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4928-0
00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:24.702
<v Hou, Eric>What we can try is if you don't want to
add more neurons and then you can change</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4928-1
00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:28.358
<v Hou, Eric>the learning rate to this level.
Let's try that again.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4930-0
00:38:28.358 --> 00:38:29.958
<v Hou, Eric>You're gonna be much slower.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4950-0
00:38:40.858 --> 00:38:46.403
<v Hou, Eric>But you know you change your learning
rate to smaller so that you can identify</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4950-1
00:38:46.403 --> 00:38:48.298
<v Hou, Eric>some local maximum minimum.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4961-0
00:38:48.378 --> 00:38:53.781
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see,
the list 4 neurons and the only raw input</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4961-1
00:38:53.781 --> 00:38:55.458
<v Hou, Eric>of XY coordinates.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4979-0
00:38:57.328 --> 00:39:03.797
<v Hou, Eric>It can separate those points and if you
are show the the test data is awesome,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4979-1
00:39:03.797 --> 00:39:04.288
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4992-0
00:39:04.648 --> 00:39:09.065
<v Hou, Eric>So then, no,
we don't quite know what those four</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/4992-1
00:39:09.065 --> 00:39:10.688
<v Hou, Eric>neurons are doing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5022-0
00:39:11.398 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Hou, Eric>But it just simplify the problem.
We can just adding adding like the hidden</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5022-1
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.802
<v Hou, Eric>layers,
adding neurons and going to solve the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5022-2
00:39:18.802 --> 00:39:21.958
<v Hou, Eric>problem for us is this feeling is so
fantastic. OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5028-0
00:39:21.958 --> 00:39:23.958
<v Hou, Eric>So now we've done this.
Let's try this guy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5032-0
00:39:24.638 --> 00:39:26.718
<v Hou, Eric>Let's still try the same neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5064-0
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:32.240
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
this one got me a little bit hard because</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5064-1
00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.990
<v Hou, Eric>no matter how we try,
gonna be looks like this because we for</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5064-2
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.498
<v Hou, Eric>those functions really some linear
combinations of those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5068-0
00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:43.538
<v Hou, Eric>So then you got stuck at .3 loss.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5071-0
00:39:54.148 --> 00:39:54.388
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5084-0
00:39:54.388 --> 00:39:58.028
<v Hou, Eric>What you can do is we can just add more
neurons and see if that can help.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5095-0
00:40:08.508 --> 00:40:12.108
<v Hou, Eric>From what I'm seeing,
this is doing the work perfectly, so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5111-0
00:40:13.568 --> 00:40:18.054
<v Hou, Eric>You know you have those dots and then
done so then adding more neurons,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5111-1
00:40:18.054 --> 00:40:20.048
<v Hou, Eric>they gonna do their calculation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5122-0
00:40:21.678 --> 00:40:24.198
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can achieve the work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5129-0
00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:28.038
<v Hou, Eric>So then the humans,
you guys do not have to figure it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5132-0
00:40:28.038 --> 00:40:29.558
<v Hou, Eric>What kind of features you wanna add?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5158-0
00:40:29.838 --> 00:40:32.704
<v Hou, Eric>And this neuron's gonna do the work
automatically for you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5158-1
00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:36.735
<v Hou, Eric>And those way it's gonna be automatically
determined by some technique we're gonna</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5158-2
00:40:36.735 --> 00:40:39.358
<v Hou, Eric>touch base later,
and then you can achieve this work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5162-0
00:40:39.358 --> 00:40:40.998
<v Hou, Eric>It's perfect, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5168-0
00:40:41.678 --> 00:40:43.678
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just move to the last one, this guy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5173-0
00:40:43.678 --> 00:40:45.998
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see if this one will work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5187-0
00:41:03.318 --> 00:41:06.118
<v Hou, Eric>Now from this chart,
the loss is actually increasing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5200-0
00:41:06.118 --> 00:41:11.518
<v Hou, Eric>So that's an indicator of it's not
solving this problem, so we can stop now.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5209-0
00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:13.598
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have only one hidden layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5213-0
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:15.478
<v Hou, Eric>So then maybe you can add another hidden
layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5229-0
00:41:17.048 --> 00:41:20.281
<v Hou, Eric>Still add like 6 neurons in here and see
whether or not you're gonna solve the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5229-1
00:41:20.281 --> 00:41:20.608
<v Hou, Eric>problem.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5241-0
00:41:42.198 --> 00:41:45.038
<v Hou, Eric>But this loss is kept increasing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5245-0
00:41:45.038 --> 00:41:47.238
<v Hou, Eric>Oh now decreasing now here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5247-0
00:41:48.728 --> 00:41:49.048
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5257-0
00:42:21.878 --> 00:42:24.718
<v Hou, Eric>Is slowly decreasing, which is awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5267-0
00:42:43.088 --> 00:42:45.928
<v Hou, Eric>He's still gonna misclassify some of the
points.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5284-0
00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:56.748
<v Hou, Eric>But what we can do is we can change this
learning rate even smaller and add one</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5284-1
00:42:56.748 --> 00:42:58.168
<v Hou, Eric>other hidden layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5290-0
00:42:59.688 --> 00:43:01.848
<v Hou, Eric>It gonna be really slow unfortunately.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5325-0
00:43:17.898 --> 00:43:23.838
<v Hou, Eric>Sometimes that you're gonna see this test
loss like unchanged. You know, in a in a,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5325-1
00:43:23.838 --> 00:43:28.435
<v Hou, Eric>in a in a trading process.
This is really like desperate for you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5325-2
00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:31.546
<v Hou, Eric>guys.
And then if you wanna train any newer</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5325-3
00:43:31.546 --> 00:43:35.648
<v Hou, Eric>network model,
this is a moment that you need to go some.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5342-0
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:40.014
<v Hou, Eric>And then drink some water and then go to
restroom and then and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5342-1
00:43:40.014 --> 00:43:41.618
<v Hou, Eric>And if you do have like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5350-0
00:43:42.728 --> 00:43:44.128
<v Hou, Eric>Something. Then you're gonna pray for.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5357-0
00:43:44.128 --> 00:43:46.528
<v Hou, Eric>And then just this is the moment that you
can adapt to do that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5375-0
00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:55.178
<v Hou, Eric>And then I I read open AI data scientist
diary or something that they're his post.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5390-0
00:43:55.178 --> 00:43:59.976
<v Hou, Eric>He said that, you know,
he always pray for merchand learning God</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5390-1
00:43:59.976 --> 00:44:03.298
<v Hou, Eric>and every single morning pray for good
luck.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5401-0
00:44:04.728 --> 00:44:07.928
<v Hou, Eric>He should be working better than just
happen. Like at 2 hidden layers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5423-0
00:44:09.808 --> 00:44:13.008
<v Hou, Eric>Because even the two hidden layers
already achieved some level.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5423-1
00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:15.808
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's just why you may be just
take some time.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5434-0
00:44:17.448 --> 00:44:21.608
<v Hou, Eric>As well, we have seen before,
so then a lot is getting higher higher.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5442-0
00:44:23.048 --> 00:44:25.208
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually,
when we when the model figure.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5450-0
00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:30.328
<v Hou, Eric>When the model figure the way out and
then gonna drop fastly. Let's see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5486-0
00:46:40.648 --> 00:46:44.608
<v Hou, Eric>OK. We just if we reach like 10,
000 it doesn't change.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5488-0
00:46:44.608 --> 00:46:45.688
<v Hou, Eric>And then we gotta stop it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5493-0
00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:48.168
<v Hou, Eric>I figured out another way out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5499-0
00:47:12.438 --> 00:47:12.998
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5504-0
00:47:13.118 --> 00:47:13.918
<v Hou, Eric>So it didn't.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5505-0
00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:14.878
<v Hou, Eric>It didn't converge.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5516-0
00:47:14.878 --> 00:47:18.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then just start over and then let's
just add more features to help it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5527-0
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:22.848
<v Hou, Eric>Let's see if this is this one really
helps or not.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5537-0
00:47:34.878 --> 00:47:37.478
<v Hou, Eric>At least from beginning is working as
intended.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5569-0
00:49:34.088 --> 00:49:36.488
<v Hou, Eric>So I think there's a good moment to stop
it, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5571-0
00:49:36.488 --> 00:49:38.208
<v Hou, Eric>So then as you can see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5590-0
00:49:39.968 --> 00:49:46.448
<v Hou, Eric>You pretty much connect all the the blue
dots together and then this this region</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5590-1
00:49:46.448 --> 00:49:48.048
<v Hou, Eric>for the orange dots.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5601-0
00:49:48.328 --> 00:49:53.548
<v Hou, Eric>So it's not perfect,
but at least like there's only 3% of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5601-1
00:49:53.548 --> 00:49:55.168
<v Hou, Eric>misclassification.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5619-0
00:49:55.728 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Hou, Eric>So this is adding more features to it to
enhance it and during the break I can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5619-1
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.288
<v Hou, Eric>definitely try to use X1X2O coordinates
to do it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5630-0
00:50:05.048 --> 00:50:07.208
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe just give some more time to those
neurons and it can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5632-0
00:50:07.248 --> 00:50:08.168
<v Hou, Eric>It can handle the work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5641-0
00:50:08.868 --> 00:50:14.268
<v Hou, Eric>But as you can see,
adding more what is driving a good value?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5643-0
00:50:14.308 --> 00:50:15.208
<v Hou, Eric>Adding more features.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5662-0
00:50:16.588 --> 00:50:22.568
<v Hou, Eric>Adding more those neurons to do this work
and then we can achieve some really</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5662-1
00:50:22.568 --> 00:50:24.868
<v Hou, Eric>complex work with this system.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5698-0
00:50:25.468 --> 00:50:30.666
<v Hou, Eric>So now this that is sort of mimicking
what our brains are working and it is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5698-1
00:50:30.666 --> 00:50:35.727
<v Hou, Eric>kind of a neural computation network and
and definitely you can enjoy the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5698-2
00:50:35.727 --> 00:50:40.788
<v Hou, Eric>scalability because you can always by by
simple click you can have a one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5708-0
00:50:41.568 --> 00:50:44.568
<v Hou, Eric>Set a team of of neurons to to your
network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5727-0
00:50:45.038 --> 00:50:49.012
<v Hou, Eric>It's definitely efficiency,
because in 5 minutes within 5 minutes,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5727-1
00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:53.104
<v Hou, Eric>or actually two or three minutes,
you already have some good results</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5727-2
00:50:53.104 --> 00:50:53.638
<v Hou, Eric>question.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5739-0
00:50:56.438 --> 00:51:00.838
<v Haroon, Sufyan>What do you recommend doing APCA before
starting the newer network?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5758-0
00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:06.617
<v Haroon, Sufyan>Analysis Or what do you recommend?
Just keeping the raw data as it is and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5758-1
00:51:06.617 --> 00:51:06.968
<v Haroon, Sufyan>doing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5751-0
00:51:06.898 --> 00:51:06.938
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5753-0
00:51:06.938 --> 00:51:06.948
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5757-0
00:51:06.948 --> 00:51:07.578
<v Hou, Eric>I don't recommend.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5769-0
00:51:07.578 --> 00:51:10.458
<v Hou, Eric>I don't recommend doing PCA.
The reason is a PCA.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5777-0
00:51:10.738 --> 00:51:13.978
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna lose a lot of information from
doing the PCA.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5779-0
00:51:14.258 --> 00:51:15.018
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5790-0
00:51:15.318 --> 00:51:18.678
<v Hou, Eric>You can just do the the.
I mean in real life, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5795-0
00:51:18.678 --> 00:51:20.958
<v Hou, Eric>In your real life, you need to define.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5802-0
00:51:20.958 --> 00:51:23.798
<v Hou, Eric>You need to determine what kind of neural
network you want to use.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5821-0
00:51:24.278 --> 00:51:27.847
<v Hou, Eric>Is this already like any dependency on
historical data?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5821-1
00:51:27.847 --> 00:51:30.078
<v Hou, Eric>If you do you you'd better use RNN.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5830-0
00:51:30.078 --> 00:51:35.096
<v Hou, Eric>And then there's some different types of
neural network we're gonna introduce next</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5830-1
00:51:35.096 --> 00:51:35.398
<v Hou, Eric>week.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5856-0
00:51:37.398 --> 00:51:43.134
<v Hou, Eric>And then I will say just use whatever raw
data you're you're doing because the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5856-1
00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:46.038
<v Hou, Eric>errors will be compounding you have PCA.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5859-0
00:51:46.278 --> 00:51:47.278
<v Hou, Eric>It won't be accurate.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5861-0
00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:49.778
<v Hou, Eric>Yep.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5863-0
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:52.428
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5865-0
00:51:52.428 --> 00:51:53.668
<v Hou, Eric>So it's good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5872-0
00:51:56.118 --> 00:51:58.318
<v Hou, Eric>The flexibility and speed, of course.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5875-0
00:51:58.478 --> 00:52:00.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5891-0
00:52:02.008 --> 00:52:08.688
<v Hou, Eric>We next job is we want to build this kind
of super fancy network of of neurons.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5911-0
00:52:08.688 --> 00:52:12.545
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
so then we need to start with some basic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5911-1
00:52:12.545 --> 00:52:17.328
<v Hou, Eric>assumptions and this is how we idealize
those neurons, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5928-0
00:52:17.408 --> 00:52:24.373
<v Hou, Eric>So then we need to to build this complex
system. We need to have some simple,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5928-1
00:52:24.373 --> 00:52:26.248
<v Hou, Eric>easy building bricks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5942-0
00:52:26.778 --> 00:52:29.654
<v Hou, Eric>Because we wanna build a big building and
then we wanna build.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5942-1
00:52:29.654 --> 00:52:31.298
<v Hou, Eric>We wanna have those building bricks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5946-0
00:52:31.298 --> 00:52:32.978
<v Hou, Eric>Handy. Umm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5955-0
00:52:32.978 --> 00:52:35.938
<v Hou, Eric>That's why we wanna idealize those
neurons.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5989-0
00:52:36.378 --> 00:52:41.144
<v Hou, Eric>So then we want the neurons to be as
simple as a different function that can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5989-1
00:52:41.144 --> 00:52:45.601
<v Hou, Eric>help us to do some simple work,
and then we hope that with those simple</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/5989-2
00:52:45.601 --> 00:52:50.738
<v Hou, Eric>function defined by us and then you can
achieve a lot of complex things just like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6002-0
00:52:51.528 --> 00:52:54.510
<v Hou, Eric>Minecraft, you know,
you have only those bricks and then you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6002-1
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:55.928
<v Hou, Eric>can build a different system.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6013-0
00:52:56.518 --> 00:52:59.718
<v Hou, Eric>And that's really the that the idea we're
using using here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6039-0
00:53:01.288 --> 00:53:04.898
<v Hou, Eric>Is gonna start with some easy work.
Easy function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6039-1
00:53:04.898 --> 00:53:09.358
<v Hou, Eric>Some easy function like the you know the
the linear functions.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6039-2
00:53:09.358 --> 00:53:12.048
<v Hou, Eric>Some functions that you have to learn.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6068-0
00:53:13.768 --> 00:53:18.203
<v Hou, Eric>Through your middle school and high
school, or even elementary school,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6068-1
00:53:18.203 --> 00:53:23.388
<v Hou, Eric>so that it's not as fancy as you know the
integrals or something that you learn in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6068-2
00:53:23.388 --> 00:53:23.888
<v Hou, Eric>college.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6070-0
00:53:23.888 --> 00:53:25.088
<v Hou, Eric>It's really simple functions.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6109-0
00:53:26.318 --> 00:53:30.771
<v Hou, Eric>Mathematics gonna be a powerful partner
to the neural network because for</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6109-1
00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Hou, Eric>mathematicians,
our work is to prove that you know you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6109-2
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.834
<v Hou, Eric>have a thought that you can use a simple
functions to mimic to to simulate the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6109-3
00:53:38.834 --> 00:53:42.264
<v Hou, Eric>complex functions.
And there is definitely gonna be some</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6109-4
00:53:42.264 --> 00:53:43.648
<v Hou, Eric>mathematical theory to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6132-0
00:53:43.648 --> 00:53:47.894
<v Hou, Eric>Prove that in in a space called
functional space you can have the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6132-1
00:53:47.894 --> 00:53:51.047
<v Hou, Eric>fundamental.
You can have simple functions and a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6132-2
00:53:51.047 --> 00:53:52.398
<v Hou, Eric>simple functions can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6139-0
00:53:53.168 --> 00:53:55.928
<v Hou, Eric>Approximate those complex functions.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6142-0
00:53:56.078 --> 00:53:57.238
<v Hou, Eric>See the way that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6157-0
00:53:58.768 --> 00:54:02.773
<v Hou, Eric>The the difference between those
simulation and a real function is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6157-1
00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:03.968
<v Hou, Eric>actually negligible.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6171-0
00:54:03.968 --> 00:54:08.118
<v Hou, Eric>You can actually ignore the differences
and then there are some math theory</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6171-1
00:54:08.118 --> 00:54:10.848
<v Hou, Eric>behind seeing that supporting these kind
of idea.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6184-0
00:54:12.688 --> 00:54:17.208
<v Hou, Eric>Here is the neural network history and
starting from 1943.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6199-0
00:54:19.248 --> 00:54:24.785
<v Hou, Eric>There is a macro log piece model and
going to high beam learning and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6199-1
00:54:24.785 --> 00:54:25.608
<v Hou, Eric>perceptron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6226-0
00:54:25.878 --> 00:54:33.656
<v Hou, Eric>On development and and going through the
CNN in 1989 in deep learning and it just</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6226-1
00:54:33.656 --> 00:54:39.158
<v Hou, Eric>only finish around 2020 and now we have
the Transformers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6234-0
00:54:40.318 --> 00:54:43.398
<v Hou, Eric>And then we have the large long career
models, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6240-0
00:54:43.398 --> 00:54:46.558
<v Hou, Eric>So that this is everything is a based on.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6242-0
00:54:48.048 --> 00:54:48.808
<v Hou, Eric>Neural networks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6256-0
00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:55.508
<v Hou, Eric>So in 1943, there's Michael Locke.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6261-0
00:54:55.868 --> 00:55:00.028
<v Hou, Eric>Pete model is directly mimicking how this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6266-0
00:55:03.078 --> 00:55:06.118
<v Hou, Eric>Cell synaptic cell is working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6269-0
00:55:07.568 --> 00:55:08.208
<v Hou, Eric>In in human brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6277-0
00:55:08.678 --> 00:55:10.678
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, how this artificial neurons there?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6293-0
00:55:10.678 --> 00:55:14.678
<v Hou, Eric>There's a design of this artificial
neuron, the next slide you're gonna see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6295-0
00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:16.918
<v Hou, Eric>The design is quite simple.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6302-0
00:55:18.278 --> 00:55:21.198
<v Hou, Eric>But it's a very good,
important starting point.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6310-0
00:55:21.478 --> 00:55:23.238
<v Hou, Eric>That we learn.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6321-0
00:55:23.238 --> 00:55:28.238
<v Hou, Eric>We Start learning from our brain and
design machines, mimicking the brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6328-0
00:55:28.638 --> 00:55:32.798
<v Hou, Eric>So we have those,
the inputs and into this kind of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6335-0
00:55:34.288 --> 00:55:37.008
<v Hou, Eric>Die drugs and then do some.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6353-0
00:55:37.008 --> 00:55:43.551
<v Hou, Eric>Do something in between and send us like
X1X22, then next neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6353-1
00:55:43.551 --> 00:55:46.128
<v Hou, Eric>This is basic idea behind.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6356-0
00:55:47.488 --> 00:55:48.128
<v Hou, Eric>The very first model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6366-0
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:53.328
<v Hou, Eric>And here is how the very first model is
working. And by the way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6378-0
00:55:54.968 --> 00:56:01.608
<v Hou, Eric>This kind of charts are quite common in
neural network or any system.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6389-0
00:56:03.208 --> 00:56:07.608
<v Hou, Eric>We will be learning and teaching and and
using in the future.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6402-0
00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:11.758
<v Hou, Eric>But I just got used to those kind of
engineering charts.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6413-0
00:56:12.118 --> 00:56:16.398
<v Hou, Eric>You gonna providing you a lot of
information, but I I do understand.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6426-0
00:56:16.478 --> 00:56:20.132
<v Hou, Eric>I I spent some time getting used to it,
reading those chart for some people it</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6426-1
00:56:20.132 --> 00:56:22.398
<v Hou, Eric>could be easy.
For some people it could be hard.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6436-0
00:56:22.758 --> 00:56:25.398
<v Hou, Eric>So what we're doing is we do have some
inputs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6446-0
00:56:25.438 --> 00:56:27.078
<v Hou, Eric>It's X1X2 to XN.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6453-0
00:56:27.278 --> 00:56:32.718
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the inputs values and then I
add another DOS that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6463-0
00:56:33.568 --> 00:56:38.288
<v Hou, Eric>Is a constant one in addition to all the
raw values that a user provided.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6483-0
00:56:38.398 --> 00:56:41.859
<v Hou, Eric>That you me provided the reason is adding
this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6483-1
00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:46.518
<v Hou, Eric>I can add intercept for example the
intercept in the linear function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6502-0
00:56:48.088 --> 00:56:55.866
<v Hou, Eric>What this 1943 model is doing is they
just directly sum up all the inputs,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6502-1
00:56:55.866 --> 00:56:56.488
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6514-0
00:56:56.488 --> 00:56:59.928
<v Hou, Eric>So then all the inputs and then call with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6527-0
00:57:00.608 --> 00:57:08.528
<v Hou, Eric>So this value is just summation of all
the inputs. The the goal of of this model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6541-0
00:57:08.528 --> 00:57:13.602
<v Hou, Eric>Why they design this model is they have a
bunch of numbers and they want to tell</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6541-1
00:57:13.602 --> 00:57:15.168
<v Hou, Eric>whether or not output is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6546-0
00:57:15.638 --> 00:57:18.078
<v Hou, Eric>Was he in a Class A or Class B?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6552-0
00:57:18.278 --> 00:57:20.318
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a really classification model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6560-0
00:57:20.518 --> 00:57:23.308
<v Hou, Eric>What they did,
they just sum up all the numbers</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6560-1
00:57:23.308 --> 00:57:24.878
<v Hou, Eric>associated with one bucket.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6578-0
00:57:25.438 --> 00:57:32.429
<v Hou, Eric>11 item they wanna classify and then once
those are higher than some threshold they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6578-1
00:57:32.429 --> 00:57:35.758
<v Hou, Eric>just pull this one other one is put a 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6583-0
00:57:35.798 --> 00:57:37.678
<v Hou, Eric>So this is as easy as that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6595-0
00:57:40.518 --> 00:57:45.278
<v Hou, Eric>The the the idea of of this is you can
think of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6597-0
00:57:47.648 --> 00:57:48.328
<v Hou, Eric>You know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6605-0
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:52.528
<v Hou, Eric>Different, different toys, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6611-0
00:57:52.528 --> 00:57:54.448
<v Hou, Eric>So then so for for my daughter.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6618-0
00:57:54.448 --> 00:57:56.568
<v Hou, Eric>She loves to have, like, some video games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6625-0
00:57:56.648 --> 00:58:00.528
<v Hou, Eric>So then there are some toys for kids.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6630-0
00:58:00.528 --> 00:58:02.448
<v Hou, Eric>Could be the legal toys, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6633-0
00:58:02.448 --> 00:58:02.888
<v Hou, Eric>Legal toys.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6636-0
00:58:02.888 --> 00:58:05.568
<v Hou, Eric>It could be $10 and $20.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6642-0
00:58:07.208 --> 00:58:08.968
<v Hou, Eric>So and some we do.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6644-0
00:58:09.368 --> 00:58:10.008
<v Hou, Eric>Could be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6661-0
00:58:10.518 --> 00:58:16.798
<v Hou, Eric>40-50 dollars and then and then you can
consider that as the input, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6694-0
00:58:16.798 --> 00:58:22.679
<v Hou, Eric>So then you wanna know whether or not
you're in the general twice session,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6694-1
00:58:22.679 --> 00:58:28.403
<v Hou, Eric>or you're in the video game session.
What you can do is you just you you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6694-2
00:58:28.403 --> 00:58:34.598
<v Hou, Eric>collect all the all the items in that
session and Add all the prizes together.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6702-0
00:58:35.528 --> 00:58:38.528
<v Hou, Eric>And then you say, hey,
if that price is higher?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6712-0
00:58:40.248 --> 00:58:43.048
<v Hou, Eric>The the summation of price is higher than
$1000.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6719-0
00:58:43.438 --> 00:58:45.318
<v Hou, Eric>I call it video game session.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6729-0
00:58:45.318 --> 00:58:49.318
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise I call it a twice session for
kids.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6732-0
00:58:49.558 --> 00:58:51.878
<v Hou, Eric>So that's sort of the idea behind the
scene.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6738-0
00:58:52.078 --> 00:58:54.158
<v Hou, Eric>So then I don't care.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6755-0
00:58:55.608 --> 00:58:58.488
<v Hou, Eric>I I just pick the same number of item
together.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6755-1
00:58:58.488 --> 00:59:00.768
<v Hou, Eric>I I say pay 10 items per each session.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6757-0
00:59:00.768 --> 00:59:02.248
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know which is which.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6778-0
00:59:02.598 --> 00:59:05.833
<v Hou, Eric>But I can just pick ten of them and I sum
up their prices,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6778-1
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:10.274
<v Hou, Eric>and that is the only number I gonna rely
on to determine this is a twice or this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6778-2
00:59:10.274 --> 00:59:10.438
<v Hou, Eric>is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6786-0
00:59:12.528 --> 00:59:13.528
<v Hou, Eric>Video games, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6792-0
00:59:13.528 --> 00:59:16.208
<v Hou, Eric>So then as you can see,
it's a pretty simple model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6794-0
00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:17.408
<v Hou, Eric>It could work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6817-0
00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:22.223
<v Hou, Eric>For example,
if you were dealing with some you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6817-1
00:59:22.223 --> 00:59:25.418
<v Hou, Eric>inference wise,
it's definitely much cheaper than the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6817-2
00:59:25.418 --> 00:59:26.128
<v Hou, Eric>video games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6836-0
00:59:26.128 --> 00:59:29.325
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if you go to some 5-6 year old twice</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6836-1
00:59:29.325 --> 00:59:33.633
<v Hou, Eric>session, those are,
you know similar prize as the video games</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6836-2
00:59:33.633 --> 00:59:34.328
<v Hou, Eric>sometimes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6873-0
00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:39.692
<v Hou, Eric>So then the summation of price may not
help you decide whether or not you are</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6873-1
00:59:39.692 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Hou, Eric>sitting at infant twice session or five
six year old,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6873-2
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:48.049
<v Hou, Eric>twice session or video game session.
But it is really good starting point,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6873-3
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.438
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6893-0
00:59:48.438 --> 00:59:52.343
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
but the summation of the prize is is is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6893-1
00:59:52.343 --> 00:59:57.046
<v Hou, Eric>only number they rely on to determine
where they stand at,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6893-2
00:59:57.046 --> 00:59:59.198
<v Hou, Eric>and that is the 1943 model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6906-0
01:00:01.058 --> 01:00:04.498
<v Hou, Eric>So then in 194049 they have a high BM
learning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6947-0
01:00:04.498 --> 01:00:09.889
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really mimicking the those
kind of information how the information</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6947-1
01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:13.552
<v Hou, Eric>in the transferring from 1 neuron to
another neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6947-2
01:00:13.552 --> 01:00:19.012
<v Hou, Eric>The only change they they start they
start defining defining weights where the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6947-3
01:00:19.012 --> 01:00:22.813
<v Hou, Eric>weights they consider.
OK the weights change should be</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6947-4
01:00:22.813 --> 01:00:25.578
<v Hou, Eric>correlated to the input information and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6956-0
01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.618
<v Hou, Eric>Output information and then they they,
they, they.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6964-0
01:00:29.328 --> 01:00:31.488
<v Hou, Eric>Creatively create a one learning rate
associated with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6968-0
01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:33.478
<v Hou, Eric>Is that and this is a formula.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6976-0
01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:37.128
<v Hou, Eric>So that's sort of contribution they've
they've done.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6996-0
01:00:38.808 --> 01:00:46.536
<v Hou, Eric>The remarkable model actually help us to
this neural network error is 1958</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/6996-1
01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:48.288
<v Hou, Eric>perceptron model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7020-0
01:00:49.048 --> 01:00:53.871
<v Hou, Eric>I just found some article from this
Cornell University stories news because</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7020-1
01:00:53.871 --> 01:00:59.012
<v Hou, Eric>some of the professors are actually from
Cornell University and I can share this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7020-2
01:00:59.012 --> 01:01:00.408
<v Hou, Eric>article with you guys.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7023-0
01:01:01.378 --> 01:01:02.458
<v Hou, Eric>Uh, quite interesting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7037-0
01:01:09.828 --> 01:01:13.186
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
So you can actually read this article</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7037-1
01:01:13.186 --> 01:01:15.628
<v Hou, Eric>about this professor perceptron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7040-0
01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:17.668
<v Hou, Eric>So they have done that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7047-0
01:01:18.228 --> 01:01:19.868
<v Hou, Eric>They have done that 60 years ago.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7052-0
01:01:19.868 --> 01:01:23.308
<v Hou, Eric>Well, this 2019 sixty years ago, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7085-0
01:01:25.528 --> 01:01:31.132
<v Hou, Eric>OK, so you can actually hear the story,
which is really cool story for for them</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7085-1
01:01:31.132 --> 01:01:36.667
<v Hou, Eric>to do. And then here's the research.
And then there's some article introducing</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7085-2
01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:38.488
<v Hou, Eric>some perceptron back then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7093-0
01:01:38.798 --> 01:01:40.758
<v Hou, Eric>Back to 2058.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7113-0
01:01:41.078 --> 01:01:44.316
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely older than everyone in this
classroom,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7113-1
01:01:44.316 --> 01:01:47.878
<v Hou, Eric>but you know they're trying to mimic that
human brain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7119-0
01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:50.958
<v Hou, Eric>So then that's was the idea back then,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7121-0
01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:53.398
<v Hou, Eric>So then and this Frank?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7145-0
01:01:55.088 --> 01:02:02.177
<v Hou, Eric>Robin is A is a designer of of this this
idea and then it's getting closer and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7145-1
01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:05.408
<v Hou, Eric>closer to the modern neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7152-0
01:02:05.408 --> 01:02:08.528
<v Hou, Eric>So we have some point.
And then eventually you want to use this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7168-0
01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:14.091
<v Hou, Eric>To to do the calculation.
Eventually you have the output signal R1</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7168-1
01:02:14.091 --> 01:02:14.558
<v Hou, Eric>to RN.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7169-0
01:02:15.238 --> 01:02:16.318
<v Hou, Eric>So it is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7196-0
01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:20.846
<v Hou, Eric>And then they say it is organization of a
biological brain,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7196-1
01:02:20.846 --> 01:02:26.491
<v Hou, Eric>and then it just they just create some
artificial brain using the the circuits</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7196-2
01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:29.278
<v Hou, Eric>and using those biers which is awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7198-0
01:02:30.688 --> 01:02:31.008
<v Hou, Eric>But then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7215-0
01:02:35.608 --> 01:02:42.008
<v Hou, Eric>And there are some metal to recognize his

01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:46.008
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely read his article after
class.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7246-0
01:02:46.008 --> 01:02:54.680
<v Hou, Eric>It's fun article to read and this and
also this perceptrons really help the US</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7246-1
01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:00.168
<v Hou, Eric>to achieve a lot of National Defense work,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7255-0
01:03:00.168 --> 01:03:03.728
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can definitely help us to
identify a lot of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7262-0
01:03:05.188 --> 01:03:07.468
<v Hou, Eric>For example, submarines or different?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7280-0
01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:15.218
<v Hou, Eric>Items on A/C and then from the Soviet
Union. Back then,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7280-1
01:03:15.218 --> 01:03:18.808
<v Hou, Eric>it's definitely gonna utilize by the US
Navy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7299-0
01:03:20.328 --> 01:03:26.157
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a,
it's a pretty cool technology used back</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7299-1
01:03:26.157 --> 01:03:29.928
<v Hou, Eric>to two 1958 the perceptual model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7313-0
01:03:31.648 --> 01:03:36.848
<v Hou, Eric>Is definitely more or less look like the
current neural network models.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7327-0
01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:43.528
<v Hou, Eric>You still have those input and then in
the previous model the high bn learning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7335-0
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:47.368
<v Hou, Eric>So then people Start learning that I need
to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7339-0
01:03:48.008 --> 01:03:50.488
<v Hou, Eric>I need to instead of sum of sum of them
up.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7368-0
01:03:51.158 --> 01:03:57.014
<v Hou, Eric>I need to start defining something called
weight instead of like arithmetic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7368-1
01:03:57.014 --> 01:04:02.638
<v Hou, Eric>summation of those in of those numbers.
Let's just do some weighted sum.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7385-0
01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:08.540
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can learn whether or not I'm
I'm dealing with inference twice or or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7385-1
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.718
<v Hou, Eric>five six year old twice or or video games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7389-0
01:04:11.998 --> 01:04:14.358
<v Hou, Eric>So then with those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7390-0
01:04:14.598 --> 01:04:15.358
<v Hou, Eric>With those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7404-0
01:04:16.328 --> 01:04:19.999
<v Hou, Eric>Ways being defined,
I can calculate the weighted sum and I</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7404-1
01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:21.368
<v Hou, Eric>can define a function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7420-0
01:04:21.598 --> 01:04:26.942
<v Hou, Eric>Where if that weight is a positive,
I call it. One is weighted,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7420-1
01:04:26.942 --> 01:04:28.278
<v Hou, Eric>sum is negative.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7443-0
01:04:28.278 --> 01:04:33.089
<v Hou, Eric>I call with zero so so where the weight
is, you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7443-1
01:04:33.089 --> 01:04:40.038
<v Hou, Eric>as a human I can assign some sums,
some some ways to. For example, if I'm in.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7464-0
01:04:42.848 --> 01:04:47.384
<v Hou, Eric>Switch video games and then there are so
many different games like Kirby game or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7464-1
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.288
<v Hou, Eric>something that's pretty expensive.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7469-0
01:04:50.318 --> 01:04:51.718
<v Hou, Eric>I bought for my daughter.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7484-0
01:04:51.718 --> 01:04:56.699
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can definitely assign those
weights higher weights to those games,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7484-1
01:04:56.699 --> 01:04:59.158
<v Hou, Eric>and then you can sign you know, higher.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7494-0
01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:06.968
<v Hou, Eric>Highways to some classic legal game.
Legal games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7497-0
01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:08.328
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can you can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7518-0
01:05:08.328 --> 01:05:12.711
<v Hou, Eric>You can use them to tell whether or not
you are standing in the video game</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7518-1
01:05:12.711 --> 01:05:15.048
<v Hou, Eric>session versus the 5-6 or leeeo session.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7527-0
01:05:15.248 --> 01:05:19.208
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is definitely the idea
behind the scene.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7539-0
01:05:20.198 --> 01:05:24.198
<v Hou, Eric>And how they assign the weights is really
random.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7550-0
01:05:24.198 --> 01:05:28.718
<v Hou, Eric>Guess and then or or they they do have
some training data.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7561-0
01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:33.238
<v Hou, Eric>So then they can just learn from the
training data to do to guess those ways.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7564-0
01:05:33.398 --> 01:05:35.278
<v Hou, Eric>There are certainly two ways to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7572-0
01:05:36.968 --> 01:05:37.488
<v Hou, Eric>Code and Co.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7582-0
01:05:37.488 --> 01:05:41.368
<v Hou, Eric>Find optimal set of weights and then
we're gonna talk about that later.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7588-0
01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:46.168
<v Hou, Eric>But perceptual model is very similar to
the current neural network model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7591-0
01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:48.528
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7594-0
01:05:49.468 --> 01:05:50.988
<v Hou, Eric>Just a quick question.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7614-0
01:05:52.528 --> 01:05:57.381
<v Hou, Eric>Do you think that what kind of model we
have already covered look extremely</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7614-1
01:05:57.381 --> 01:05:59.488
<v Hou, Eric>similar to this perceptron model?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7630-0
01:06:00.198 --> 01:06:04.712
<v Hou, Eric>There's actually one more that we have
already covered that looks very similar</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7630-1
01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:05.398
<v Hou, Eric>to this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7632-0
01:06:05.398 --> 01:06:07.158
<v Hou, Eric>Which model is that?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7639-0
01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:22.768
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah, so, so the model I'm mentioning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7657-0
01:06:24.288 --> 01:06:27.501
<v Hou, Eric>Is, you know,
if we change the sign function to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7657-1
01:06:27.501 --> 01:06:30.648
<v Hou, Eric>exponential function or or even more is a
SIM.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7669-0
01:06:32.408 --> 01:06:36.648
<v Hou, Eric>This perception perceptron model turns to
be a logistic regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7676-0
01:06:37.048 --> 01:06:41.008
<v Hou, Eric>So that's what I'm sort of talking about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7691-0
01:06:41.008 --> 01:06:45.629
<v Hou, Eric>So then for logistic regression,
the only difference is we're still gonna</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7691-1
01:06:45.629 --> 01:06:46.128
<v Hou, Eric>do this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7693-0
01:06:46.288 --> 01:06:48.208
<v Hou, Eric>Sum the weighted summation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7712-0
01:06:48.798 --> 01:06:53.437
<v Hou, Eric>We're gonna change.
We're gonna replace is assign function to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7712-1
01:06:53.437 --> 01:06:57.478
<v Hou, Eric>a sigmoid function and then we never ask
bigger than.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7745-0
01:06:59.008 --> 01:07:04.181
<v Hou, Eric>Whenever this, this,
this summation of those summation bigger</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7745-1
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:07.935
<v Hou, Eric>than .
5 we're gonna assign to 1 to this and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7745-2
01:07:07.935 --> 01:07:13.608
<v Hou, Eric>then when when this this guy less than .5,
we're gonna assign to 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7751-0
01:07:13.608 --> 01:07:17.193
<v Hou, Eric>That's the difference between the
logistic regression and the perceptual</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7751-1
01:07:17.193 --> 01:07:17.488
<v Hou, Eric>model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7761-0
01:07:18.578 --> 01:07:23.378
<v Hou, Eric>But structure wise same structure but
different function we were using.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7763-0
01:07:25.148 --> 01:07:25.188
<v Hou, Eric>K.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7781-0
01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:33.058
<v Hou, Eric>So before we move to the main components
of a neural network, any questions so far?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7787-0
01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:37.338
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully so far isn't that difficult,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7790-0
01:07:43.148 --> 01:07:43.588
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7805-0
01:07:44.188 --> 01:07:49.828
<v Hou, Eric>Let's take a 15 minute break.
So we come back on 656.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7814-0
01:07:50.068 --> 01:07:54.004
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we start defining a neural
network. OK,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7814-1
01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.628
<v Hou, Eric>I will see you guys in 15 minutes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7965-0
01:22:53.448 --> 01:22:55.368
<v Hou, Eric>All right, we'll come back.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7968-0
01:22:56.818 --> 01:22:57.458
<v Hou, Eric>Share my screen.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7971-0
01:23:01.928 --> 01:23:03.088
<v Hou, Eric>Still reported.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7975-0
01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:05.858
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7986-0
01:23:05.858 --> 01:23:11.125
<v Hou, Eric>So main components of neural network,
usually neural neural network looks like</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/7986-1
01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:11.458
<v Hou, Eric>this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8008-0
01:23:11.698 --> 01:23:17.241
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have input layer,
you have a hidden layer is a one or two a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8008-1
01:23:17.241 --> 01:23:21.938
<v Hou, Eric>three or four that have output layer
right? So then so each.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8020-0
01:23:23.978 --> 01:23:28.498
<v Hou, Eric>Circle in those hidden layers called the
node or neuron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8023-0
01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:30.778
<v Hou, Eric>So then it could be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8036-0
01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:34.618
<v Hou, Eric>Transformation.
It could be a linear transformation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8038-0
01:23:34.618 --> 01:23:35.938
<v Hou, Eric>It will be activation function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8051-0
01:23:36.328 --> 01:23:43.328
<v Hou, Eric>And so like the the biological neurons.
So it's doing something right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8057-0
01:23:43.328 --> 01:23:46.248
<v Hou, Eric>So then, so this is a perceptron.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8079-0
01:23:46.248 --> 01:23:52.014
<v Hou, Eric>And then we do have a hidden layer that
is just doing a weighted summation of the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8079-1
01:23:52.014 --> 01:23:55.248
<v Hou, Eric>input and applying that sign function,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8098-0
01:23:55.248 --> 01:24:00.139
<v Hou, Eric>So it's a positive if the weighted
summation is a positive and then you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8098-1
01:24:00.139 --> 01:24:03.128
<v Hou, Eric>assign one or zero.
So that is your output.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8105-0
01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:05.608
<v Hou, Eric>So then this input layer hidden layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8109-0
01:24:05.688 --> 01:24:06.888
<v Hou, Eric>And and output layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8136-0
01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:12.513
<v Hou, Eric>So the input layer is I what you can see
those are your input.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8136-1
01:24:12.513 --> 01:24:16.762
<v Hou, Eric>The output layer is also another layer
that you can sort of. See.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8136-2
01:24:16.762 --> 01:24:18.178
<v Hou, Eric>Those are the outputs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8152-0
01:24:19.408 --> 01:24:22.031
<v Hou, Eric>A lot of times that the hidden layer can
be, uh,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8152-1
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:26.528
<v Hou, Eric>really complex and then you don't usually
see what's happening in the hidden layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8162-0
01:24:28.058 --> 01:24:31.178
<v Hou, Eric>So I understand that business want to
avoid any black box.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8169-0
01:24:32.858 --> 01:24:34.698
<v Hou, Eric>Being used right? So they want to know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8190-0
01:24:36.568 --> 01:24:40.901
<v Hou, Eric>Given the the input,
how the how that output was generated,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8190-1
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:44.728
<v Hou, Eric>that's going to be extremely hard for
newer network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8195-0
01:24:46.178 --> 01:24:48.338
<v Hou, Eric>In in tree model at least you can see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8206-0
01:24:50.098 --> 01:24:54.178
<v Hou, Eric>This tree structure and then you can
certainly tell how.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8230-0
01:24:55.778 --> 01:25:01.653
<v Hou, Eric>How that tree is doing either regression
or classification decisions for neural</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8230-1
01:25:01.653 --> 01:25:05.618
<v Hou, Eric>network it's it's it's going to be
extremely hard to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8256-0
01:25:06.048 --> 01:25:12.092
<v Hou, Eric>Output whatever the hidden layer is doing,
the different ways are doing so the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8256-1
01:25:12.092 --> 01:25:18.288
<v Hou, Eric>something you need you guys eventually
need to help business with is to explain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8281-0
01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:23.544
<v Hou, Eric>The new network so that the better
expectation you need to set with the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8281-1
01:25:23.544 --> 01:25:27.658
<v Hou, Eric>business is as long as the output is
accurate and then that's that'll be it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8283-0
01:25:28.018 --> 01:25:29.538
<v Hou, Eric>You know the the.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8287-0
01:25:32.098 --> 01:25:34.018
<v Hou, Eric>It's it's not quite.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8290-0
01:25:35.778 --> 01:25:36.738
<v Hou, Eric>Possible to?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8300-0
01:25:38.388 --> 01:25:41.948
<v Hou, Eric>To to to, to generate, and to visualize.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8311-0
01:25:41.948 --> 01:25:46.156
<v Hou, Eric>And then even if you can do that,
there's definitely some Python packages</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8311-1
01:25:46.156 --> 01:25:46.668
<v Hou, Eric>help you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8317-0
01:25:48.178 --> 01:25:50.018
<v Hou, Eric>To plot the hidden layers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8333-0
01:25:52.018 --> 01:25:56.804
<v Hou, Eric>There are just so many numbers in between
and that you wouldn't know to replicate</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8333-1
01:25:56.804 --> 01:25:57.738
<v Hou, Eric>the calculation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8345-0
01:25:58.378 --> 01:26:02.818
<v Hou, Eric>So that'll be really hard for for neural
network it's a it's a black box.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8359-0
01:26:04.498 --> 01:26:07.298
<v Hou, Eric>And then when we touch base on the deep
learning that will be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8362-0
01:26:08.898 --> 01:26:08.938
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8364-0
01:26:08.938 --> 01:26:09.778
<v Hou, Eric>A deeply black box.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8369-0
01:26:10.408 --> 01:26:13.448
<v Hou, Eric>So super hard to explain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8393-0
01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:25.248
<v Hou, Eric>So then this feed forward, Anor network,
is very widely used,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8393-1
01:26:25.248 --> 01:26:28.848
<v Hou, Eric>and then whenever you Google neural
network,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8393-2
01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:32.848
<v Hou, Eric>you pretty much see these kind of picture,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8403-0
01:26:32.848 --> 01:26:38.281
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have layer.
You have 1-2 hidden layers and they have</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8403-1
01:26:38.281 --> 01:26:39.368
<v Hou, Eric>output layer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8420-0
01:26:41.218 --> 01:26:47.455
<v Hou, Eric>And and and deep learning is really like
you have the hidden layer more complex</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8420-1
01:26:47.455 --> 01:26:48.858
<v Hou, Eric>and then you have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8422-0
01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:50.328
<v Hou, Eric>A.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8431-0
01:26:50.328 --> 01:26:53.928
<v Hou, Eric>A much bigger and two number of hidden
layers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8444-0
01:26:53.928 --> 01:26:58.760
<v Hou, Eric>So that's a deep learning.
So those kind of functions or or neurons</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8444-1
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.608
<v Hou, Eric>in between can help us to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8447-0
01:27:01.608 --> 01:27:03.488
<v Hou, Eric>Analyze non linear data.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8456-0
01:27:04.978 --> 01:27:08.418
<v Hou, Eric>As you can see for for example like those
classification.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8479-0
01:27:10.098 --> 01:27:18.098
<v Hou, Eric>Examples we've seen in in Tensorflow web
page and then and then we do have some</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8479-1
01:27:18.098 --> 01:27:21.498
<v Hou, Eric>recurrent networks, so one famous.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8498-0
01:27:23.418 --> 01:27:28.723
<v Hou, Eric>Recurrent network is called RNN,
so so recurrent neural networks are</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8498-1
01:27:28.723 --> 01:27:30.338
<v Hou, Eric>really assuming that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8513-0
01:27:31.708 --> 01:27:38.908
<v Hou, Eric>Some historical data can affect the
future information, the future results.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8519-0
01:27:38.978 --> 01:27:41.938
<v Hou, Eric>So then you in in in your network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8527-0
01:27:41.938 --> 01:27:46.298
<v Hou, Eric>You cannot just ignore the historical
data you you just need to have a loop.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8539-0
01:27:46.978 --> 01:27:53.178
<v Hou, Eric>To to to taking the historical data into
account.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8543-0
01:27:53.218 --> 01:27:55.658
<v Hou, Eric>So for time series it would definitely a
good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8549-0
01:27:57.148 --> 01:28:00.948
<v Hou, Eric>Use case for for RNN so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8584-0
01:28:02.828 --> 01:28:06.154
<v Hou, Eric>And those are long long term short memory
model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8584-1
01:28:06.154 --> 01:28:11.651
<v Hou, Eric>Lstm model is also another way that we
can use on the time series models and and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8584-2
01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:15.859
<v Hou, Eric>we can attach based.
We can talk about the the RNN over there</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8584-3
01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:17.148
<v Hou, Eric>when we talk about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8587-0
01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:19.678
<v Hou, Eric>The recurrent networks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8593-0
01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:22.708
<v Hou, Eric>So here is a one example of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8607-0
01:28:24.348 --> 01:28:31.698
<v Hou, Eric>Eliyah Sukaver is talking about RNN.
I think it's a back then 2016 or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8607-1
01:28:31.698 --> 01:28:32.748
<v Hou, Eric>something.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8613-0
01:28:34.258 --> 01:28:36.418
<v Hou, Eric>So he gonna he's actually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8621-0
01:28:37.908 --> 01:28:40.028
<v Hou, Eric>Is a Co founder of open AII do I?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8651-0
01:28:40.028 --> 01:28:45.644
<v Hou, Eric>I found this video on YouTube and then
you can if he's showing you guys showing</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8651-1
01:28:45.644 --> 01:28:50.628
<v Hou, Eric>the audience like they're they're work
using RNN at open AI back then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8657-0
01:28:50.988 --> 01:28:52.268
<v Hou, Eric>So it's kind of interesting.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8666-0
01:28:52.268 --> 01:28:55.748
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just want to share this video
with you guys and see if play.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8670-0
01:28:58.938 --> 01:28:59.818
<v Hou, Eric>See your floor.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8672-0
01:29:00.138 --> 01:29:01.218
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. Thank you very much.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8680-0
01:29:01.818 --> 01:29:03.978
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you for your just quick chat.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8682-0
01:29:04.178 --> 01:29:05.498
<v Hou, Eric>Can you guys hear it?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8685-0
01:29:05.618 --> 01:29:06.898
<v Hou, Eric>Is it OK to hear it?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8690-0
01:29:10.198 --> 01:29:10.878
<v Mizwicki, Andrew>We can hear it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8697-0
01:29:10.448 --> 01:29:12.008
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yeah. Yep. We could do it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8700-0
01:29:11.658 --> 01:29:13.498
<v Hou, Eric>I saw that you can just watch on YouTube.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8703-0
01:29:14.618 --> 01:29:15.098
<v Hou, Eric>Here we go.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8707-0
01:29:15.498 --> 01:29:16.858
<v Hou, Eric>Thank you for your attention.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8725-0
01:29:17.738 --> 01:29:22.186
<v Hou, Eric>Got a small typo.
You know last last second. Oh, by the way,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8725-1
01:29:22.186 --> 01:29:24.738
<v Hou, Eric>this is the open AI logo back then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8748-0
01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:31.612
<v Hou, Eric>It's really funny to see their logo like
this, but you know in the title. Yeah.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8748-1
01:29:31.612 --> 01:29:34.708
<v Hou, Eric>So this is really 16 minute presentation,
OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8750-0
01:29:38.058 --> 01:29:38.738
<v Hou, Eric>So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8758-0
01:29:41.258 --> 01:29:45.658
<v Hou, Eric>I'd like to begin by telling you about
the open AI universe.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8766-0
01:29:48.858 --> 01:29:51.298
<v Hou, Eric>So the goal.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8787-0
01:29:51.418 --> 01:29:58.532
<v Hou, Eric>So the open share universe is a platform
for benchmarking and developing the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8787-1
01:29:58.532 --> 01:30:05.738
<v Hou, Eric>ability of agents to solve a wide variety
of new problems that are difficult.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8804-0
01:30:09.038 --> 01:30:12.646
<v Hou, Eric>At the present,
the Open Air Universe includes a very</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8804-1
01:30:12.646 --> 01:30:14.718
<v Hou, Eric>large number of computer games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8805-0
01:30:14.878 --> 01:30:15.638
<v Hou, Eric>Is a video playing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8808-0
01:30:15.638 --> 01:30:16.318
<v Hou, Eric>Yes, great.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8822-0
01:30:16.398 --> 01:30:20.558
<v Hou, Eric>So it includes a large number of computer
games which includes these.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8846-0
01:30:21.398 --> 01:30:26.674
<v Hou, Eric>It includes a large number of browser
tasks which are shown in this slide where</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8846-1
01:30:26.674 --> 01:30:31.620
<v Hou, Eric>in a browser task you need to read the
instructions and then perform them,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8846-2
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.918
<v Hou, Eric>and these instructions often include
things like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8861-0
01:30:36.618 --> 01:30:41.412
<v Hou, Eric>Feel a certain form in a certain way,
or manipulate the objects in a specific</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8861-1
01:30:41.412 --> 01:30:41.658
<v Hou, Eric>way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8886-0
01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.146
<v Hou, Eric>We also including real websites,
for example,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8886-1
01:30:46.146 --> 01:30:51.034
<v Hou, Eric>in this case we have the task of booking
an airline ticket on the airline's</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8886-2
01:30:51.034 --> 01:30:51.548
<v Hou, Eric>website.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8895-0
01:30:52.188 --> 01:30:56.159
<v Hou, Eric>And finally,
we are in the process of integrating a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8895-1
01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.228
<v Hou, Eric>MODIS numbers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8896-0
01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:58.468
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, by the way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8909-0
01:31:00.148 --> 01:31:04.002
<v Hou, Eric>Those booking ticket,
those kind of thing can be done currently</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8909-1
01:31:04.002 --> 01:31:05.508
<v Hou, Eric>still by opening I model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8929-0
01:31:05.898 --> 01:31:09.436
<v Hou, Eric>But really,
a genetic approach can do this work for</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8929-1
01:31:09.436 --> 01:31:12.497
<v Hou, Eric>you,
so they sort of achieve what they want,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8929-2
01:31:12.497 --> 01:31:15.218
<v Hou, Eric>whatever they want to achieve back then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8951-0
01:31:15.618 --> 01:31:19.231
<v Hou, Eric>But it's only funny to see, like,
open AI is dealing with those kind of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8951-1
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:21.338
<v Hou, Eric>video games, because right now they don't.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8957-0
01:31:21.338 --> 01:31:22.538
<v Hou, Eric>They're not dealing with video games.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8962-0
01:31:22.538 --> 01:31:24.218
<v Hou, Eric>They're just dealing with one single
model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8988-0
01:31:25.748 --> 01:31:30.110
<v Hou, Eric>One the airlines website and finally we
are in the process of integrating a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8988-1
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:33.612
<v Hou, Eric>modest number of extremely complex
environments that include</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8988-2
01:31:33.612 --> 01:31:35.908
<v Hou, Eric>three-dimensional games in large worlds.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/8995-0
01:31:36.378 --> 01:31:38.938
<v Hou, Eric>It includes even 3 dimensional protein
folding.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9009-0
01:31:40.878 --> 01:31:48.301
<v Hou, Eric>So the key feature of universe that makes
it an appealing platform is that it</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9009-1
01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:49.158
<v Hou, Eric>provides.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9028-0
01:31:50.628 --> 01:31:57.164
<v Hou, Eric>Easy programmatic access to any existing
computer program. The way it works,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9028-1
01:31:57.164 --> 01:32:01.748
<v Hou, Eric>roughly speaking,
is that the program runs somewhere.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9043-0
01:32:03.468 --> 01:32:08.088
<v Hou, Eric>The universe infrastructure takes the
pixels of this program and sends it to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9043-1
01:32:08.088 --> 01:32:10.428
<v Hou, Eric>the agent, and then the agent responds.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9059-0
01:32:11.018 --> 01:32:16.698
<v Hou, Eric>By sending the keyboard commands and the
mouse commands. By the way, this is still.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9102-0
01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:20.425
<v Hou, Eric>This is still the current approach.
High level 10,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9102-1
01:32:20.425 --> 01:32:23.361
<v Hou, Eric>000 mile above ground kind of approach
idea.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9102-2
01:32:23.361 --> 01:32:28.059
<v Hou, Eric>You you have whatever environment is sort
of like Internet environment,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9102-3
01:32:28.059 --> 01:32:32.886
<v Hou, Eric>you have the information and then you
have the large amount of models who</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9102-4
01:32:32.886 --> 01:32:36.018
<v Hou, Eric>receive those information you,
you code it, AG.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9111-0
01:32:36.778 --> 01:32:40.538
<v Hou, Eric>The agents using what your command and
then also the information the agent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9128-0
01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:45.702
<v Hou, Eric>And then to mimic all the keyboard and
and mouse and to have some information</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9128-1
01:32:45.702 --> 01:32:46.178
<v Hou, Eric>back to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9142-0
01:32:47.708 --> 01:32:50.988
<v Hou, Eric>To to the purpose that you want the agent
to to to accomplish, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9148-0
01:32:50.988 --> 01:32:53.388
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's sort of like similar
approach that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9157-0
01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:59.108
<v Hou, Eric>Lidia just presented like about 10 years
ago.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9181-0
01:33:00.828 --> 01:33:04.647
<v Hou, Eric>But you can now see that an
infrastructure like this allows our</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9181-1
01:33:04.647 --> 01:33:07.988
<v Hou, Eric>agents to interact with any existing
computer programs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9187-0
01:33:09.108 --> 01:33:11.628
<v Hou, Eric>So I want to say a few words now about
the current state.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9223-0
01:33:11.898 --> 01:33:16.504
<v Hou, Eric>States of universe.
At present we have hundreds of fully</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9223-1
01:33:16.504 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Hou, Eric>integrated environments where the fully
integrated I mean that it is possible to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9223-2
01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:27.818
<v Hou, Eric>do reinforcement learning on them with
today's algorithms.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9245-0
01:33:29.348 --> 01:33:32.705
<v Hou, Eric>We also have over 1000 of environments
which are integrated but which do not</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9245-1
01:33:32.705 --> 01:33:33.708
<v Hou, Eric>have a reward function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9265-0
01:33:33.988 --> 01:33:37.769
<v Hou, Eric>These many of these environments have
demonstrations and they are useful for</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9265-1
01:33:37.769 --> 01:33:41.108
<v Hou, Eric>invasive reinforcement learning or for
behavioral cloning training.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9281-0
01:33:42.898 --> 01:33:48.138
<v Hou, Eric>And we will soon have more,
even very large and complex environments.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9284-0
01:33:48.578 --> 01:33:49.858
<v Hou, Eric>So what's the goal?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9286-0
01:33:49.898 --> 01:33:51.178
<v Hou, Eric>The goal of the universe.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9307-0
01:33:52.098 --> 01:33:57.893
<v Hou, Eric>We want to build an agent that can solve
new and difficult problems quickly,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9307-1
01:33:57.893 --> 01:34:02.258
<v Hou, Eric>and we want to measure how far along we
are on this path.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9325-0
01:34:03.988 --> 01:34:07.773
<v Hou, Eric>If we can measure how far along we are,
we can iterate and make incremental</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9325-1
01:34:07.773 --> 01:34:09.068
<v Hou, Eric>progress towards the goal.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9343-0
01:34:10.828 --> 01:34:16.298
<v Hou, Eric>So next I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about the technical details</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9343-1
01:34:16.298 --> 01:34:17.108
<v Hou, Eric>of universe.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9348-0
01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.548
<v Hou, Eric>So a program is launched.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9358-0
01:34:22.558 --> 01:34:26.638
<v Hou, Eric>In a lightweight virtual machine called
the Docker container a docker container.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9360-0
01:34:27.978 --> 01:34:28.738
<v Hou, Eric>And so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9381-0
01:34:30.188 --> 01:34:35.388
<v Hou, Eric>What we do is that the virtual machine
interacts with the process using the VMC</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9381-1
01:34:35.388 --> 01:34:36.948
<v Hou, Eric>remote desktop protocol.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9411-0
01:34:37.468 --> 01:34:41.425
<v Hou, Eric>So this protocol sends pixels from the
environment to the agent,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9411-1
01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Hou, Eric>and this protocol also determines how the
actions,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9411-2
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:49.217
<v Hou, Eric>the key Princess and the mouse commands
are being sent from the agent to the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9411-3
01:34:49.217 --> 01:34:49.948
<v Hou, Eric>environment.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9422-0
01:34:51.668 --> 01:34:56.434
<v Hou, Eric>One thing that is nice about this
infrastructure is that the environment</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9422-1
01:34:56.434 --> 01:34:57.348
<v Hou, Eric>and the agent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9453-0
01:34:57.658 --> 01:35:01.626
<v Hou, Eric>They run on different processes and they
communicate over the network,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9453-1
01:35:01.626 --> 01:35:06.321
<v Hou, Eric>but the network is a very general concept,
which means that the environment and the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9453-2
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:10.569
<v Hou, Eric>agent can be on the same machine.
They can be within the same local network</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9453-3
01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:13.308
<v Hou, Eric>and they can even be on different
computers and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9492-0
01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:15.930
<v Hou, Eric>Could communicate over the Internet,
for example,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9492-1
01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:19.864
<v Hou, Eric>the environment could be on the cloud
while the agent can be on your local</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9492-2
01:35:19.864 --> 01:35:22.696
<v Hou, Eric>machine. Now,
while this would introduce some latency</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9492-3
01:35:22.696 --> 01:35:25.738
<v Hou, Eric>to the interaction between the agent and
the environment.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9523-0
01:35:25.938 --> 01:35:29.202
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
we've tested some environments where</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9523-1
01:35:29.202 --> 01:35:34.005
<v Hou, Eric>which were running on Amazon while the
agent was running on our cluster as is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9523-2
01:35:34.005 --> 01:35:35.298
<v Hou, Eric>shown in this figure.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9545-0
01:35:35.618 --> 01:35:39.423
<v Hou, Eric>And what you observed is that when you
have a batch of 32 environments,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9545-1
01:35:39.423 --> 01:35:42.858
<v Hou, Eric>it takes 110 milliseconds for the pixels
to arrive to the agent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9563-0
01:35:42.898 --> 01:35:46.424
<v Hou, Eric>And it takes 30 milliseconds for the
actions to arrive back to the environment</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9563-1
01:35:46.424 --> 01:35:47.138
<v Hou, Eric>from the agents.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9570-0
01:35:48.218 --> 01:35:52.018
<v Hou, Eric>So one thing that we've done as we were
working on universe.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9579-0
01:35:52.828 --> 01:35:55.548
<v Hou, Eric>Was to integrate a game that many of us
at open AI like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9591-0
01:35:55.978 --> 01:35:59.298
<v Hou, Eric>It is called Slicer dot IO.
Is strongly strongly recommended.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9596-0
01:35:59.298 --> 01:36:01.658
<v Hou, Eric>It's a little fun and we just.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9619-0
01:36:03.188 --> 01:36:06.704
<v Hou, Eric>Included and we ran a simple
reinforcement learning algorithm on it</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9619-1
01:36:06.704 --> 01:36:09.548
<v Hou, Eric>and we were able to get the results that
you see here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9633-0
01:36:09.588 --> 01:36:13.999
<v Hou, Eric>So it's nice to see that we can just
easily integrate environments and run our</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9633-1
01:36:13.999 --> 01:36:14.948
<v Hou, Eric>algorithms on it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9657-0
01:36:16.628 --> 01:36:21.224
<v Hou, Eric>Another notable fact about Universe is
that we've been able to convince a large</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9657-1
01:36:21.224 --> 01:36:25.188
<v Hou, Eric>number of game publishers to allow us to
release their environments.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9673-0
01:36:25.418 --> 01:36:28.697
<v Hou, Eric>Their games within in the framework of
universe,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9673-1
01:36:28.697 --> 01:36:32.578
<v Hou, Eric>it's funny to see that in video was a
game publisher Act.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9675-0
01:36:34.108 --> 01:36:34.148
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9677-0
01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:34.668
<v Hou, Eric>I I wouldn't.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9679-0
01:36:36.508 --> 01:36:36.668
<v Hou, Eric>Put.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9687-0
01:36:39.148 --> 01:36:42.188
<v Hou, Eric>Our whatever those other companies are in
Microsoft.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9700-0
01:36:42.188 --> 01:36:46.948
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So they have some of the games,
but I don't know. It's kind of funny.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9717-0
01:36:46.948 --> 01:36:51.909
<v Hou, Eric>So the reason this is a sensible thing to
do is because if you look at the things</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9717-1
01:36:51.909 --> 01:36:54.148
<v Hou, Eric>that humans been humans do right now.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9734-0
01:36:54.578 --> 01:36:58.428
<v Hou, Eric>You look at our lives,
we spend a pretty big chunk of them in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9734-1
01:36:58.428 --> 01:37:02.340
<v Hou, Eric>front of the computer.
We spend a large portion of our time in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9734-2
01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:03.458
<v Hou, Eric>the digital world.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9766-0
01:37:04.988 --> 01:37:10.362
<v Hou, Eric>And universe allows agents to become
first class citizens of the same digital</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9766-1
01:37:10.362 --> 01:37:14.772
<v Hou, Eric>world that we inhabit,
and so that means that it is the kind of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9766-2
01:37:14.772 --> 01:37:20.077
<v Hou, Eric>place where we could really measure how
good our agent is at general problem</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9766-3
01:37:20.077 --> 01:37:20.628
<v Hou, Eric>solving.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9769-0
01:37:20.788 --> 01:37:22.388
<v Hou, Eric>A general world knowledge and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9771-0
01:37:24.028 --> 01:37:24.348
<v Hou, Eric>Just how?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9776-0
01:37:25.218 --> 01:37:27.138
<v Hou, Eric>Generally it is as opposed to being
specialized.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9819-0
01:37:29.108 --> 01:37:31.686
<v Hou, Eric>So concurrently to the development of
universe,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9819-1
01:37:31.686 --> 01:37:35.606
<v Hou, Eric>we were also working on a bunch of
research and I want to highlight this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9819-2
01:37:35.606 --> 01:37:40.063
<v Hou, Eric>specific research project which is called
real squared which is fast reinforcement</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9819-3
01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:44.305
<v Hou, Eric>learning by slow reinforcement learning
and most of the work was done by Rocky</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9819-4
01:37:44.305 --> 01:37:44.788
<v Hou, Eric>Duan who.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9822-0
01:37:45.138 --> 01:37:46.578
<v Hou, Eric>In this photo.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9837-0
01:37:48.788 --> 01:37:55.302
<v Hou, Eric>And the question that real squared tries
to answer is what's the difference</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9837-1
01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:56.588
<v Hou, Eric>between humans?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9856-0
01:37:58.108 --> 01:38:00.898
<v Hou, Eric>And between reinforcement learning
algorithms,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9856-1
01:38:00.898 --> 01:38:03.628
<v Hou, Eric>how can it be that humans are so much
faster?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9859-0
01:38:04.068 --> 01:38:06.028
<v Hou, Eric>Can we articulate some of the differences?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9867-0
01:38:08.428 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Hou, Eric>Well,
obviously humans have excellent data</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9867-1
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.068
<v Hou, Eric>efficiency.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9872-0
01:38:12.828 --> 01:38:14.348
<v Hou, Eric>Humans make very good use of the data.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9883-0
01:38:15.158 --> 01:38:19.284
<v Hou, Eric>And in addition,
humans have reached prior experience</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9883-1
01:38:19.284 --> 01:38:22.798
<v Hou, Eric>solving lots of different difficult
problems.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9919-0
01:38:24.918 --> 01:38:28.365
<v Hou, Eric>Prior experience can be easily
represented with the distribution over</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9919-1
01:38:28.365 --> 01:38:30.827
<v Hou, Eric>environments,
so here I'm showing a subset of the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9919-2
01:38:30.827 --> 01:38:34.619
<v Hou, Eric>universe environments that I showed
earlier on and you could say this is the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9919-3
01:38:34.619 --> 01:38:38.558
<v Hou, Eric>you could imagine and this would be a set
of tasks that our agent has been Exp.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9948-0
01:38:38.798 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Hou, Eric>To in the past,
and so you could imagine learning things</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9948-1
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:46.778
<v Hou, Eric>like the nature of rules or maybe the
appearance and dynamics of objects,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9948-2
01:38:46.778 --> 01:38:50.798
<v Hou, Eric>typical ways in which control works,
how scoring works and so on.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9955-0
01:38:53.068 --> 01:38:55.108
<v Hou, Eric>And so how do we do it?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9978-0
01:38:55.108 --> 01:38:59.051
<v Hou, Eric>How do we benefit from this experience?
If you have a distribution over</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9978-1
01:38:59.051 --> 01:39:01.899
<v Hou, Eric>environments,
how do we take the knowledge in those</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/9978-2
01:39:01.899 --> 01:39:05.788
<v Hou, Eric>environments and embed them into the
reinforcement learning algorithm?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10006-0
01:39:07.348 --> 01:39:12.064
<v Hou, Eric>And the solution is,
in short is to train a recurrent neural</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10006-1
01:39:12.064 --> 01:39:16.548
<v Hou, Eric>network policy to solve many environments
simultaneously.</v>

01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:19.988
<v Hou, Eric>In other words,
meta learning in reinforcement learning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10019-0
01:39:21.028 --> 01:39:23.588
<v Hou, Eric>Let me explain the idea to you,
which is pretty simple.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10028-0
01:39:25.018 --> 01:39:29.498
<v Hou, Eric>What you really want is to have a
recurrent neural network policy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10030-0
01:39:31.868 --> 01:39:32.468
<v Hou, Eric>That.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10034-0
01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:33.148
<v Hou, Eric>Should be able to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10061-0
01:39:33.588 --> 01:39:36.628
<v Hou, Eric>You should be able to do the following
with it. You take it,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10061-1
01:39:36.628 --> 01:39:40.515
<v Hou, Eric>you put it into one of your random and
you took you place it into one of your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10061-2
01:39:40.515 --> 01:39:44.502
<v Hou, Eric>environments, which is chosen at random,
and then you so and then you run it on</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10061-3
01:39:44.502 --> 01:39:45.548
<v Hou, Eric>this environment and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10076-0
01:39:45.548 --> 01:39:50.377
<v Hou, Eric>You measure how well you do so.
Literally the performance measure of this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10076-1
01:39:50.377 --> 01:39:54.228
<v Hou, Eric>recurrent neural network policy is how
well does it solve.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10085-0
01:39:54.928 --> 01:39:58.328
<v Hou, Eric>Environments drawn from your environment
distribution.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10111-0
01:39:58.568 --> 01:40:02.426
<v Hou, Eric>Notice that in this case the recurrent
neural network gets both the observation</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10111-1
01:40:02.426 --> 01:40:06.043
<v Hou, Eric>from the environment and the reward.
The recurrent neural network needs to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10111-2
01:40:06.043 --> 01:40:08.888
<v Hou, Eric>know the reward because it needs to know
what the task is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10129-0
01:40:09.928 --> 01:40:15.593
<v Hou, Eric>And so that means if you succeed in
training such a recurrent neural network,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10129-1
01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:18.208
<v Hou, Eric>it will be a kind of a meta learner.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10141-0
01:40:18.568 --> 01:40:21.890
<v Hou, Eric>It will be a very specialized
reinforcement learning algorithm that is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10141-1
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:23.948
<v Hou, Eric>good at a very limited set of
environments.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10165-0
01:40:24.978 --> 01:40:28.398
<v Hou, Eric>So in practice,
how would it look like you take your RNN</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10165-1
01:40:28.398 --> 01:40:32.298
<v Hou, Eric>policy and you let it interact with one
environment for a while?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10190-0
01:40:32.338 --> 01:40:35.920
<v Hou, Eric>You run an episode with one environment,
then you run an episode with a different</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10190-1
01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.235
<v Hou, Eric>environment,
and then you run another episode with a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10190-2
01:40:38.235 --> 01:40:39.458
<v Hou, Eric>different environment still.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10208-0
01:40:40.178 --> 01:40:42.357
<v Hou, Eric>And so in practice,
you will have a slower reinforcement</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10208-1
01:40:42.357 --> 01:40:45.338
<v Hou, Eric>learning algorithm as you'll be training
the recurrent neural network policy.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10221-0
01:40:45.338 --> 01:40:50.806
<v Hou, Eric>So it will shepherd it's way to become
good at solving those environments and be</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10221-1
01:40:50.806 --> 01:40:51.818
<v Hou, Eric>a meta learner.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10224-0
01:40:52.628 --> 01:40:53.468
<v Hou, Eric>So I should say.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10260-0
01:40:54.458 --> 01:40:57.747
<v Hou, Eric>Meta learning with neural networks has a
pretty rich history,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10260-1
01:40:57.747 --> 01:41:01.512
<v Hou, Eric>and as many of us have already noticed,
there is quite a bit of mutual</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10260-2
01:41:01.512 --> 01:41:05.915

01:41:05.915 --> 01:41:10.158
<v Hou, Eric>there's a paper by Wang Garal on learning

<v Hou, Eric>It's a DeepMind paper which had very
similar ideas and even quite similar</v>

<v Hou, Eric>Not that new.
The novelty here would be to say that we</v>

<v Hou, Eric>There's been work on, for example,

01:42:10.388 --> 01:42:11.548
<v Hou, Eric>I want to say a little bit more about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10450-0
01:42:13.908 --> 01:42:18.853
<v Hou, Eric>How the recurrent how met learning in a

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10450-1
01:42:18.853 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Hou, Eric>panel in the top rectangle you will see
the hidden states of the recurrent neural</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10450-2
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:24.348
<v Hou, Eric>network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10471-0
01:42:24.498 --> 01:42:28.382
<v Hou, Eric>And you're going to run the recurrent
neural network on one episode of your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10471-1
01:42:28.382 --> 01:42:30.989
<v Hou, Eric>environment.
Then you run it on another episode of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10471-2
01:42:30.989 --> 01:42:31.858
<v Hou, Eric>Your Environment.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10513-0
01:42:32.258 --> 01:42:36.096
<v Hou, Eric>Then you replace the environment.
You go to a different environment that</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10513-1
01:42:36.096 --> 01:42:40.197
<v Hou, Eric>you want to solve with the same RNN,
and you also reset your sever the hidden</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10513-2
01:42:40.197 --> 01:42:43.614
<v Hou, Eric>state when you switch environment you
serve with a hidden state,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10513-3
01:42:43.614 --> 01:42:46.348
<v Hou, Eric>the hidden state of the RNN is start over.
So this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10521-0
01:42:46.348 --> 01:42:48.178
<v Hou, Eric>Is basically. This is the formulation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10523-0
01:42:48.178 --> 01:42:49.258
<v Hou, Eric>It's extremely simple.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10527-0
01:42:49.258 --> 01:42:50.378
<v Hou, Eric>There isn't much to it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10537-0
01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:54.258
<v Hou, Eric>And now the slow reinforcement learning
algorithm is trust.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10541-0
01:42:54.618 --> 01:42:55.418
<v Hou, Eric>Policy optimization.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10552-0
01:42:55.418 --> 01:42:57.898
<v Hou, Eric>But Schumann, Adop in 2015.
We use this algorithm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10560-0
01:42:58.218 --> 01:43:01.578
<v Hou, Eric>So now I want to spend just a little bit
of time talking about evaluation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10590-0
01:43:03.068 --> 01:43:07.252
<v Hou, Eric>So first evaluation was a multi armed
bandits. The thing about those,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10590-1
01:43:07.252 --> 01:43:12.092
<v Hou, Eric>the interesting thing about multi armed
bandits is that they have asymptotically</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10590-2
01:43:12.092 --> 01:43:13.228
<v Hou, Eric>optimal algorithms.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10617-0
01:43:15.068 --> 01:43:18.398
<v Hou, Eric>So in these experiments,
which I don't know how well you can see</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10617-1
01:43:18.398 --> 01:43:22.086
<v Hou, Eric>them, but I'll just summarize the results.
When you compete against the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10617-2
01:43:22.086 --> 01:43:23.828
<v Hou, Eric>asymptotically optimal algorithms.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10628-0
01:43:24.378 --> 01:43:27.938
<v Hou, Eric>And you train your meta learner RNN on
short episodes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10636-0
01:43:27.978 --> 01:43:30.098
<v Hou, Eric>You only have a short time horizon.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10675-0
01:43:30.138 --> 01:43:33.042
<v Hou, Eric>You're able to outperform the the optimal
algorithm,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10675-1
01:43:33.042 --> 01:43:36.988
<v Hou, Eric>which is asymptotical asymptotic.
So it needs a lot of data on the left</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10675-2
01:43:36.988 --> 01:43:41.481
<v Hou, Eric>when your amount of data when you give it
100 rounds in the middle then you match</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10675-3
01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:44.988
<v Hou, Eric>the asymptotically optimal algorithm and
on the right when you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10684-0
01:43:44.988 --> 01:43:46.258
<v Hou, Eric>Give 500 times steps.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10692-0
01:43:46.258 --> 01:43:49.418
<v Hou, Eric>You begin to underperform to the
asymptotically optimal algorithm.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10700-0
01:43:49.658 --> 01:43:52.298
<v Hou, Eric>We found the same pattern when you looked
at tabular Mdps.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10706-0
01:43:53.588 --> 01:43:54.468
<v Hou, Eric>With tabular Mdps.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10738-0
01:43:56.638 --> 01:43:59.538
<v Hou, Eric>You also similarly have certain
specialized algorithms,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10738-1
01:43:59.538 --> 01:44:02.541
<v Hou, Eric>and again we will observe that when the
episode is short,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10738-2
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:06.218
<v Hou, Eric>when the time horizon is short,
we manage to outperform it as the time</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10738-3
01:44:06.218 --> 01:44:09.118
<v Hou, Eric>horizon increases, we match it,
and eventually we stop.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10755-0
01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:12.799
<v Hou, Eric>We start doing a little bit worse and the
reason for that is of course simple</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10755-1
01:44:12.799 --> 01:44:15.678
<v Hou, Eric>reinforcement learning is a long time
horizons is difficult.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10772-0
01:44:16.078 --> 01:44:19.883
<v Hou, Eric>Now finally I want to show you a little
bit more to tell you a little bit more</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10772-1
01:44:19.883 --> 01:44:22.918
<v Hou, Eric>about our larger task which involves 3
dimensional navigation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10786-0
01:44:23.588 --> 01:44:27.206
<v Hou, Eric>In this case,
the goal of the meta learning is to learn</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10786-1
01:44:27.206 --> 01:44:28.628
<v Hou, Eric>to solve random mazes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10812-0
01:44:29.328 --> 01:44:32.420
<v Hou, Eric>And what do you need to what we are
trying to achieve is the following.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10812-1
01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.168
<v Hou, Eric>At first, when you see the new maze,
it's never seen it before.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10816-0
01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:37.008
<v Hou, Eric>So if you'll see a new maze for the first
time.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10824-0
01:44:40.218 --> 01:44:42.218
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
it will see a new ways for the first time.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10837-0
01:44:42.698 --> 01:44:45.976
<v Hou, Eric>It will try to find the item in a certain
item,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10837-1
01:44:45.976 --> 01:44:49.458
<v Hou, Eric>but then in the next episode it knows
where it is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10845-0
01:44:49.458 --> 01:44:52.458
<v Hou, Eric>So if you find it much faster and I'll
show you the video.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10862-0
01:44:52.458 --> 01:44:55.486
<v Hou, Eric>So look at the right side. See,
it will walk around and it's, you know,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10862-1
01:44:55.486 --> 01:44:56.538
<v Hou, Eric>it tries to find its way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10863-0
01:44:56.538 --> 01:44:58.298
<v Hou, Eric>It's looking it's searching.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10867-0
01:44:58.298 --> 01:44:59.618
<v Hou, Eric>And now it found it.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10879-0
01:44:59.978 --> 01:45:02.429
<v Hou, Eric>And the next time around,
it will immediately find it because it</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10879-1
01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:03.258
<v Hou, Eric>remembers where it is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10894-0
01:45:03.258 --> 01:45:06.887
<v Hou, Eric>So this is a form of meta learning,
replied to a fairly narrow domain.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10894-1
01:45:06.887 --> 01:45:08.778
<v Hou, Eric>We also found that it makes mistakes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10899-0
01:45:08.778 --> 01:45:10.018
<v Hou, Eric>So in this case you will see that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10913-0
01:45:10.298 --> 01:45:14.587
<v Hou, Eric>Doesn't realize that it hasn't turned to
a specific corridor which is passed by</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10913-1
01:45:14.587 --> 01:45:15.338
<v Hou, Eric>several times.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10931-0
01:45:16.828 --> 01:45:20.554
<v Hou, Eric>So it's not the easiest thing to train.
The real point here also,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10931-1
01:45:20.554 --> 01:45:24.336
<v Hou, Eric>and it's pretty sensitive.
So I would say that the conclusion here</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10931-2
01:45:24.336 --> 01:45:24.788
<v Hou, Eric>is that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10942-0
01:45:26.668 --> 01:45:29.748
<v Hou, Eric>Meta learning has the potential to be
really powerful.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10957-0
01:45:29.828 --> 01:45:34.223
<v Hou, Eric>We haven't really solved meta learning
and by that I mean we haven't come up</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10957-1
01:45:34.223 --> 01:45:34.508
<v Hou, Eric>with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10964-0
01:45:35.188 --> 01:45:40.588
<v Hou, Eric>So then he just talking about one use
case of the RNN.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10985-0
01:45:41.618 --> 01:45:46.083
<v Hou, Eric>I hope you guys heard some key words that
he mentioned that you know the gradient</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10985-1
01:45:46.083 --> 01:45:48.098
<v Hou, Eric>descent is definitely using that and.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10993-0
01:45:50.428 --> 01:45:52.388
<v Hou, Eric>Then those are the back propagation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/10997-0
01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:53.428
<v Hou, Eric>He's definitely using that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11029-0
01:45:53.428 --> 01:45:58.929
<v Hou, Eric>So then those are really good examples.
And then also it's really fun to see that,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11029-1
01:45:58.929 --> 01:46:04.431
<v Hou, Eric>you know, #1 open AI logo looks like this.
And then also like I I feel open wasn't</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11029-2
01:46:04.431 --> 01:46:08.474
<v Hou, Eric>doing what they were,
they were planning to do and then they</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11029-3
01:46:08.474 --> 01:46:09.468
<v Hou, Eric>just switch GE.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11033-0
01:46:09.468 --> 01:46:10.748
<v Hou, Eric>To another different model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11054-0
01:46:11.778 --> 01:46:16.800
<v Hou, Eric>Which is kind of cool to see,
but anyways it could be one example and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11054-1
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:22.324
<v Hou, Eric>then you can definitely search for for
for Nidia is definitely Co founder of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11054-2
01:46:22.324 --> 01:46:22.898
<v Hou, Eric>open AI.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11062-0
01:46:24.948 --> 01:46:28.108
<v Hou, Eric>So lot of cool things that he has done,
OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11064-0
01:46:32.298 --> 01:46:33.178
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11077-0
01:46:34.708 --> 01:46:37.948
<v Hou, Eric>Jump back to to our basic neural network
now now.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11079-0
01:46:37.948 --> 01:46:39.028
<v Hou, Eric>RNN yet right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11090-0
01:46:39.028 --> 01:46:43.028
<v Hou, Eric>So then we we still wanna define the ways
and biases, OK?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11107-0
01:46:43.108 --> 01:46:47.483
<v Hou, Eric>So remember,
I told you guys I added X 0 equal to one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11107-1
01:46:47.483 --> 01:46:50.028
<v Hou, Eric>This is really one term I added.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11115-0
01:46:50.028 --> 01:46:54.108
<v Hou, Eric>So not raw raw input from the user, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11125-0
01:46:54.108 --> 01:46:58.588
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will have a weight AW0
associated with this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11130-0
01:46:59.988 --> 01:47:01.308
<v Hou, Eric>Associated with one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11168-0
01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:07.165
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then this,
this W zero is going to be called bias</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11168-1
01:47:07.165 --> 01:47:14.299
<v Hou, Eric>and all the WS for example W1 associate
with X1W2 associate with X2 and WN</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11168-2
01:47:14.299 --> 01:47:17.818
<v Hou, Eric>associate with XN and back and forth.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11181-0
01:47:17.818 --> 01:47:23.738
<v Hou, Eric>So those top views of social with a real
raw input, those are called weights.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11185-0
01:47:24.138 --> 01:47:27.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is a really simplified.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11194-0
01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:30.508
<v Hou, Eric>Or or or or simplest model that we've
seen this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11197-0
01:47:32.428 --> 01:47:33.068
<v Hou, Eric>This this model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11212-0
01:47:33.178 --> 01:47:36.938
<v Hou, Eric>And then we only have one set of W123
ends.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11219-0
01:47:37.138 --> 01:47:40.298
<v Hou, Eric>But if you go back to this model, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11232-0
01:47:40.298 --> 01:47:44.018
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can consider each connection
you have Aw.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11236-0
01:47:44.088 --> 01:47:46.928
<v Hou, Eric>W so then you will be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11244-0
01:47:46.928 --> 01:47:49.248
<v Hou, Eric>You will be have like so many different
WS.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11249-0
01:47:49.248 --> 01:47:52.328
<v Hou, Eric>So then the WS is really a long.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11260-0
01:47:53.778 --> 01:47:59.458
<v Hou, Eric>Array of umm of numbers umm and those WS
are definitely can be negative.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11276-0
01:48:01.498 --> 01:48:04.618
<v Hou, Eric>Because you may have like a negative
weight of social wisdom.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11280-0
01:48:04.698 --> 01:48:08.178
<v Hou, Eric>So then those are the ways that you know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11288-0
01:48:09.858 --> 01:48:12.698
<v Hou, Eric>Corresponding to each input layer, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11290-0
01:48:12.698 --> 01:48:13.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11313-0
01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:19.502
<v Hou, Eric>Just keeping in mind that we we we start
hash based on the weights and then when</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11313-1
01:48:19.502 --> 01:48:23.208
<v Hou, Eric>we talk about the the large language
models, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11326-0
01:48:23.208 --> 01:48:27.408
<v Hou, Eric>So then we'll be using the weights to do
another thing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11336-0
01:48:28.088 --> 01:48:31.008
<v Hou, Eric>So then we'll be using the ways to do the
embedding.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11346-0
01:48:31.648 --> 01:48:38.528
<v Hou, Eric>So then you'll see that how the way how
we convert English word.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11355-0
01:48:39.258 --> 01:48:42.058
<v Hou, Eric>Or or different words in different
languages to numbers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11362-0
01:48:42.768 --> 01:48:44.368
<v Hou, Eric>We're not actually using.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11375-0
01:48:44.368 --> 01:48:50.408
<v Hou, Eric>We we can we we have a variety of ways to
define those embedding coefficients.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11384-0
01:48:51.898 --> 01:48:55.338
<v Hou, Eric>Basically converting a language to
numbers or list of numbers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11401-0
01:48:57.178 --> 01:49:02.635
<v Hou, Eric>So the way we decide to use eventually
going to be the weights of that gigantic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11401-1
01:49:02.635 --> 01:49:03.658
<v Hou, Eric>neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11411-0
01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:08.138
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is some some point we're
gonna talk later.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11418-0
01:49:09.778 --> 01:49:11.658
<v Hou, Eric>But just keep in mind the weights are
just weights.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11429-0
01:49:11.968 --> 01:49:15.408
<v Hou, Eric>And then you can do the weighted uh
weighted summation like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11435-0
01:49:16.858 --> 01:49:18.458
<v Hou, Eric>Is quite simple idea.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11437-0
01:49:18.538 --> 01:49:19.658
<v Hou, Eric>Now you have those weights.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11477-0
01:49:21.418 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Hou, Eric>Activation function,
so activation function like what I said,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11477-1
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:30.368
<v Hou, Eric>we have already seen one activation
function before that activation function</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11477-2
01:49:30.368 --> 01:49:35.262
<v Hou, Eric>that that that model is a logistic
regression in the logistic regression we</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11477-3
01:49:35.262 --> 01:49:37.258
<v Hou, Eric>were using this function right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11489-0
01:49:37.258 --> 01:49:42.392
<v Hou, Eric>So 1 / 1 + E to the minus X and then back.
Then we will talk about the logistic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11489-1
01:49:42.392 --> 01:49:43.098
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11498-0
01:49:43.328 --> 01:49:45.808
<v Hou, Eric>But I told you guys, it's all function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11502-0
01:49:45.848 --> 01:49:48.288
<v Hou, Eric>So the one of the very famous.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11507-0
01:49:49.738 --> 01:49:50.698
<v Hou, Eric>Activation functions that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11523-0
01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:56.258
<v Hou, Eric>And we use in your network.
So in we have so many different,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11523-1
01:49:56.258 --> 01:49:58.698
<v Hou, Eric>uh common activation functions.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11524-0
01:49:58.698 --> 01:49:59.298
<v Hou, Eric>Those are.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11556-0
01:49:59.298 --> 01:50:04.194
<v Hou, Eric>This is definitely not the full list of
activation functions you you've seen.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11556-1
01:50:04.194 --> 01:50:09.027
<v Hou, Eric>You will be seeing uh in your network,
but those are really common ones like</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11556-2
01:50:09.027 --> 01:50:11.538
<v Hou, Eric>linear activation function. Sigmoid. Uh.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11563-0
01:50:11.538 --> 01:50:14.818
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely we are not a stranger to
sigmoid function just like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11574-0
01:50:16.258 --> 01:50:20.018
<v Hou, Eric>Sigmoid function is you have a two class
classification.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11595-0
01:50:20.368 --> 01:50:23.961
<v Hou, Eric>Then the problem to solve,
and then you're happily gonna use a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11595-1
01:50:23.961 --> 01:50:26.128
<v Hou, Eric>sigmoid function and a value function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11605-0
01:50:26.448 --> 01:50:29.568
<v Hou, Eric>Rectified a linear unit,
and then we're gonna see this function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11609-0
01:50:29.568 --> 01:50:31.808
<v Hou, Eric>This one is a code like almost.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11622-0
01:50:33.338 --> 01:50:37.858
<v Hou, Eric>Popular activation function we use
especially for regression problems.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11643-0
01:50:37.978 --> 01:50:43.615
<v Hou, Eric>Hyperbolic tangent function the softmax
function and softmax function is perhaps</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11643-1
01:50:43.615 --> 01:50:48.138
<v Hou, Eric>a code and code most popular function we
use for classification.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11670-0
01:50:48.948 --> 01:50:51.744
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then we have so many different</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11670-1
01:50:51.744 --> 01:50:57.199
<v Hou, Eric>activation functions that we can use in
neural network and then those are their</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11670-2
01:50:57.199 --> 01:51:00.268
<v Hou, Eric>math formula.
We can just go through 1 by 1.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11684-0
01:51:00.308 --> 01:51:05.896
<v Hou, Eric>So linear neurons is so they have a
linear activation function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11684-1
01:51:05.896 --> 01:51:07.468
<v Hou, Eric>It's super simple.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11691-0
01:51:08.938 --> 01:51:09.898
<v Hou, Eric>It's just a linear function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11710-0
01:51:09.898 --> 01:51:13.995
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
if you have X1 here and the Y = 1 + 2 X</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11710-1
01:51:13.995 --> 01:51:18.458
<v Hou, Eric>and then that's sort of the computation
you were doing with.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11745-0
01:51:18.768 --> 01:51:22.313
<v Hou, Eric>In a neuron,
and then you're just apply a linear</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11745-1
01:51:22.313 --> 01:51:26.942
<v Hou, Eric>function on top of it,
and then whatever that bias which is the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11745-2
01:51:26.942 --> 01:51:33.091
<v Hou, Eric>B and and the weights which are those W's,
how those guys are determined to optimize</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11745-3
01:51:33.091 --> 01:51:37.648
<v Hou, Eric>your outcome and that that is through the
backpropagation but.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11770-0
01:51:37.648 --> 01:51:40.761
<v Hou, Eric>As you know,
at this at the beginning you can just</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11770-1
01:51:40.761 --> 01:51:45.400
<v Hou, Eric>randomly select your bias and randomly
select your your your weights right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11770-2
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:45.888
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11776-0
01:51:46.658 --> 01:51:48.498
<v Hou, Eric>It just doing this is a weighted.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11783-0
01:51:49.008 --> 01:51:50.288
<v Hou, Eric>Summation for you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11784-0
01:51:50.328 --> 01:51:53.048
<v Hou, Eric>So quite simple function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11794-0
01:51:54.288 --> 01:51:56.768
<v Hou, Eric>Another one is a binary threshold.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11798-0
01:51:57.008 --> 01:51:57.888
<v Hou, Eric>So what is this?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11826-0
01:51:57.888 --> 01:52:03.568
<v Hou, Eric>So the binary threshold is.
If I do have some Yu bigger than 0 or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11826-1
01:52:03.568 --> 01:52:09.248
<v Hou, Eric>bigger than some specific a number some
threshold, I call it one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11830-0
01:52:09.288 --> 01:52:10.768
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise I call it 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11837-0
01:52:10.768 --> 01:52:14.728
<v Hou, Eric>So that is a binary threshold function is
doing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11845-0
01:52:15.418 --> 01:52:18.218
<v Hou, Eric>So for example,
if you decide to introduce.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11852-0
01:52:18.528 --> 01:52:20.208
<v Hou, Eric>Use bias to this function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11865-0
01:52:20.208 --> 01:52:23.938
<v Hou, Eric>So then I can just say, hey,
if this is Z is bigger than 0,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11865-1
01:52:23.938 --> 01:52:24.808
<v Hou, Eric>I call it one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11894-0
01:52:24.808 --> 01:52:27.982
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise I call it zero.
If you doing this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11894-1
01:52:27.982 --> 01:52:32.214
<v Hou, Eric>This is really like the 1943 model where
we're introducing,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11894-2
01:52:32.214 --> 01:52:36.728
<v Hou, Eric>but this is more a little bit complex
than that for that model.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11899-0
01:52:36.768 --> 01:52:38.288
<v Hou, Eric>All the W's are one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11925-0
01:52:38.768 --> 01:52:43.356
<v Hou, Eric>All the all the weights are are,
are are the same number one or the 2nd</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11925-1
01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:46.351
<v Hou, Eric>way.
If you do not want to introduce if you do</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11925-2
01:52:46.351 --> 01:52:48.008
<v Hou, Eric>not want to introduce the.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11930-0
01:52:49.408 --> 01:52:50.288
<v Hou, Eric>The bias.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11967-0
01:52:50.288 --> 01:52:55.521
<v Hou, Eric>So then you're you're you're just
basically doing the way this you weighted</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11967-1
01:52:55.521 --> 01:53:00.410
<v Hou, Eric>sum of those inputs and then you have
eventually have to determine the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11967-2
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:04.266
<v Hou, Eric>threshold and bigger than that threshold,
you have one,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11967-3
01:53:04.266 --> 01:53:09.568
<v Hou, Eric>otherwise you have a 0 effectively you
compare the 1st way the 2nd way this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11975-0
01:53:09.568 --> 01:53:13.328
<v Hou, Eric>Theta threshold is actually the the minus
B in the 1st way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/11980-0
01:53:14.098 --> 01:53:15.618
<v Hou, Eric>So their they're equivalent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12008-0
01:53:16.408 --> 01:53:20.661
<v Hou, Eric>This function is basically saying hey,
I have a threshold.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12008-1
01:53:20.661 --> 01:53:25.203
<v Hou, Eric>If your whatever way how you summarize
your your input values.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12008-2
01:53:25.203 --> 01:53:29.168
<v Hou, Eric>If that value bigger than my threshold I
call you one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12015-0
01:53:29.408 --> 01:53:30.888
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise they call it 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12019-0
01:53:30.928 --> 01:53:32.688
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's more.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12027-0
01:53:32.728 --> 01:53:36.528
<v Hou, Eric>That's pretty much how this binary
threshold neuron is working.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12029-0
01:53:38.898 --> 01:53:39.058
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12032-0
01:53:39.698 --> 01:53:41.178
<v Hou, Eric>This value function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12061-0
01:53:42.858 --> 01:53:49.661
<v Hou, Eric>So often you're gonna use this function,
so it's really like you have summation of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12061-1
01:53:49.661 --> 01:53:55.978
<v Hou, Eric>This is bigger than equal to 0 if Z
bigger than equal to 0, it is what it is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12065-0
01:53:56.098 --> 01:53:58.778
<v Hou, Eric>However, if this guy less than 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12069-0
01:53:59.088 --> 01:54:00.608
<v Hou, Eric>You just zero it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12075-0
01:54:01.198 --> 01:54:03.318
<v Hou, Eric>So that that's it you just do.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12081-0
01:54:05.578 --> 01:54:06.738
<v Hou, Eric>A weighted average.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12094-0
01:54:06.738 --> 01:54:10.667
<v Hou, Eric>Oh, sorry.
Weighted sum of your input and still you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12094-1
01:54:10.667 --> 01:54:14.218
<v Hou, Eric>can start with some randomly selected
numbers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12098-0
01:54:14.298 --> 01:54:15.778
<v Hou, Eric>This B could be 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12115-0
01:54:15.778 --> 01:54:20.429
<v Hou, Eric>Could be whatever number you want.
Those W's can be can be 0 or whatever</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12115-1
01:54:20.429 --> 01:54:22.978
<v Hou, Eric>number you want at the at the beginning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12127-0
01:54:22.978 --> 01:54:29.778
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you choose your your start
set of weights and then you you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12156-0
01:54:30.168 --> 01:54:34.590
<v Hou, Eric>You you chose your own bias here,
and then you do the summation of them.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12156-1
01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:38.648
<v Hou, Eric>And then if that sum is bigger than 0,
you just keep the Y as was.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12161-0
01:54:38.968 --> 01:54:41.888
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise you just zero out that.
Not that Yu.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12196-0
01:54:42.288 --> 01:54:48.011
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have this one as a part of
the the network and then you just keeping</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12196-1
01:54:48.011 --> 01:54:53.735
<v Hou, Eric>all the positive value in going forward
as you can see if you connect this value</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12196-2
01:54:53.735 --> 01:54:56.208
<v Hou, Eric>function and this binary threshold.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12201-0
01:54:57.018 --> 01:54:58.538
<v Hou, Eric>Threshold function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12205-0
01:54:58.578 --> 01:55:00.458
<v Hou, Eric>So you can pass all the positive value.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12225-0
01:55:00.608 --> 01:55:06.950
<v Hou, Eric>You here and then this one gonna
automatically assign A1 if this is an old</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12225-1
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:10.248
<v Hou, Eric>right after this radio function, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12232-0
01:55:10.248 --> 01:55:11.448
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you don't.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12250-0
01:55:11.608 --> 01:55:14.804
<v Hou, Eric>You know,
we we talk about how we optimize this B</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12250-1
01:55:14.804 --> 01:55:17.808
<v Hou, Eric>and ways,
but you know in this value function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12258-0
01:55:19.298 --> 01:55:21.778
<v Hou, Eric>Know that you know this is really doing
this work.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12271-0
01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:29.778
<v Hou, Eric>Weighted summation and 0 the value out if
the weighted summation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12273-0
01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:30.928
<v Hou, Eric>It is not here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12284-0
01:55:32.988 --> 01:55:34.668
<v Hou, Eric>And sigmoid function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12286-0
01:55:34.708 --> 01:55:38.468
<v Hou, Eric>Sigmoid function is converting this
entire.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12290-0
01:55:39.978 --> 01:55:41.418
<v Hou, Eric>Weighted weighted sum.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12301-0
01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:44.488
<v Hou, Eric>Into a probability between zero and one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12310-0
01:55:45.048 --> 01:55:49.368
<v Hou, Eric>This is what a sigmoid function is doing,
so that if your final outcome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12344-0
01:55:49.488 --> 01:55:54.241
<v Hou, Eric>Is only zero and one.
That kind of a classification problem</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12344-1
01:55:54.241 --> 01:55:58.123
<v Hou, Eric>you're solving,
and then the last node you would</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12344-2
01:55:58.123 --> 01:56:04.540
<v Hou, Eric>definitely do is a sigmoid node because
you don't need any value bigger than one</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12344-3
01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:05.728
<v Hou, Eric>or less than 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12368-0
01:56:05.728 --> 01:56:11.021
<v Hou, Eric>You just need some value in between and
then so then if the the probability from</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12368-1
01:56:11.021 --> 01:56:14.680
<v Hou, Eric>this node is bigger than .
5 you call it one other one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12368-2
01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.248
<v Hou, Eric>Otherwise you call it 0.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12375-0
01:56:16.328 --> 01:56:19.488
<v Hou, Eric>So then you definitely want to have the
Sigma. I found a sigmoid.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12381-0
01:56:19.888 --> 01:56:22.088
<v Hou, Eric>As a last note, in your newer network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12396-0
01:56:23.578 --> 01:56:28.618
<v Hou, Eric>Hyper about Hyper V tangent function is
sort of like a similar function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12426-0
01:56:29.098 --> 01:56:34.803
<v Hou, Eric>It looks similar to sigmoid. You know,
it's definitely A0 centered,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12426-1
01:56:34.803 --> 01:56:41.011
<v Hou, Eric>so the good news and the good news is
definitely have like a well behaved</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12426-2
01:56:41.011 --> 01:56:42.018
<v Hou, Eric>derivatives.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12432-0
01:56:42.018 --> 01:56:45.258
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's great for gradient descent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12439-0
01:56:46.168 --> 01:56:48.328
<v Hou, Eric>Is how this function is used.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12459-0
01:56:48.328 --> 01:56:53.856
<v Hou, Eric>I don't foresee we're going to use any
hyperbolic tangent function in this class,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12459-1
01:56:53.856 --> 01:56:56.688
<v Hou, Eric>but just show you guys where this is also.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12470-0
01:56:58.498 --> 01:57:01.778
<v Hou, Eric>Good activation function to use softmax
units.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12496-0
01:57:02.258 --> 01:57:09.871
<v Hou, Eric>So this guy is you do have the outcome to
be any way you and then you can help you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12496-1
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:16.658
<v Hou, Eric>to normalize the probability in case you
have in case you have more than.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12506-0
01:57:17.168 --> 01:57:20.888
<v Hou, Eric>One class or an two class two class
classify.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12517-0
01:57:21.168 --> 01:57:25.087
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you would definitely use
softer Max function and softer Max</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12517-1
01:57:25.087 --> 01:57:26.448
<v Hou, Eric>function looks like this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12520-0
01:57:28.098 --> 01:57:28.258
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12541-0
01:57:28.258 --> 01:57:35.442
<v Hou, Eric>So we just quickly go through all the
activation functions and here is a pros</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12541-1
01:57:35.442 --> 01:57:39.218
<v Hou, Eric>and cons of of different selected set of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12551-0
01:57:41.698 --> 01:57:43.858
<v Hou, Eric>Set of activation function right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12555-0
01:57:43.858 --> 01:57:46.338
<v Hou, Eric>So then obviously in this class.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12566-0
01:57:47.028 --> 01:57:50.188
<v Hou, Eric>You can just remember if you have a 22.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12597-0
01:57:50.808 --> 01:57:55.919
<v Hou, Eric>Class classification problem you,
you you definitely wanna choose a sigmoid</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12597-1
01:57:55.919 --> 01:58:00.290
<v Hou, Eric>for regression problem.
You use a value quite often and then you</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12597-2
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:03.585
<v Hou, Eric>have more than two class classification
problem.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12597-3
01:58:03.585 --> 01:58:06.208
<v Hou, Eric>You you definitely want to use softmax.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12610-0
01:58:07.538 --> 01:58:12.849
<v Hou, Eric>And if you remember those points,
I think that's a good enough in this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12610-1
01:58:12.849 --> 01:58:13.298
<v Hou, Eric>class.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12633-0
01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:20.358
<v Hou, Eric>And definitely as what I said.
So this is sort of in a fancy way how to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12633-1
01:58:20.358 --> 01:58:22.408
<v Hou, Eric>write a logistic regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12639-0
01:58:22.408 --> 01:58:25.208
<v Hou, Eric>Logistic regression.
You can actually consider that as.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12652-0
01:58:26.988 --> 01:58:28.828
<v Hou, Eric>As as a newer network per southeast.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12669-0
01:58:29.548 --> 01:58:33.270
<v Hou, Eric>But you didn't figure that out.
Just because we have a better way to to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12669-1
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:35.028
<v Hou, Eric>to solve this logistic regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12682-0
01:58:35.188 --> 01:58:39.152
<v Hou, Eric>But if you write the logistic regression
in this format,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12682-1
01:58:39.152 --> 01:58:41.308
<v Hou, Eric>you definitely want to do this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12684-0
01:58:41.308 --> 01:58:42.948
<v Hou, Eric>You definitely want to have a bias.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12726-0
01:58:44.168 --> 01:58:50.057
<v Hou, Eric>He definitely have a set of weights and
then you did a weighted sum over there</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12726-1
01:58:50.057 --> 01:58:55.424
<v Hou, Eric>and then you have you have this
activation function define as a sigmoid</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12726-2
01:58:55.424 --> 01:58:59.897
<v Hou, Eric>function and that's exactly you did in
logistic regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12726-3
01:58:59.897 --> 01:59:04.668
<v Hou, Eric>You have the probability as output and
then you assign you you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12739-0
01:59:04.668 --> 01:59:09.128
<v Hou, Eric>Definitely assign a one or zero based
upon the the probability that you have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12749-0
01:59:09.828 --> 01:59:12.588
<v Hou, Eric>As a direct or raw outcome from the
logistic regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12766-0
01:59:13.658 --> 01:59:18.503
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So yeah,
so this is a new way to see the logistic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12766-1
01:59:18.503 --> 01:59:20.458
<v Hou, Eric>regression as a one of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12775-0
01:59:22.148 --> 01:59:25.853
<v Hou, Eric>Network.
So we're not strange to neural network</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12775-1
01:59:25.853 --> 01:59:26.548
<v Hou, Eric>actually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12783-0
01:59:28.468 --> 01:59:31.028
<v Hou, Eric>So the next question is OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12793-0
01:59:31.388 --> 01:59:36.148
<v Hou, Eric>We do know that, you know, we said, OK,
so from different.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12809-0
01:59:38.308 --> 01:59:43.988
<v Hou, Eric>Activation functions we rely on a
weighted sum of those raw inputs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12830-0
01:59:44.138 --> 01:59:50.551
<v Hou, Eric>And then those are sort of before we have
any result into the activation function,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12830-1
01:59:50.551 --> 01:59:55.418
<v Hou, Eric>we have to calculate the weighted sum of
those input, so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12844-0
01:59:56.988 --> 02:00:01.668
<v Hou, Eric>How do we find the best set of weights
right? So then how do we find?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12848-0
02:00:01.788 --> 02:00:03.068
<v Hou, Eric>How do we find this?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12852-0
02:00:03.348 --> 02:00:04.748
<v Hou, Eric>Remember we are.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12855-0
02:00:04.908 --> 02:00:10.028
<v Hou, Eric>Remember, our goal is to generate.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12860-0
02:00:11.788 --> 02:00:14.268
<v Hou, Eric>Best results? Best results meaning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12865-0
02:00:14.898 --> 02:00:18.418
<v Hou, Eric>We want to minimize.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12873-0
02:00:19.948 --> 02:00:21.108
<v Hou, Eric>The total errors, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12881-0
02:00:21.108 --> 02:00:26.268
<v Hou, Eric>So then we want our outcome from our
model to be.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12897-0
02:00:27.778 --> 02:00:35.458
<v Hou, Eric>Accurate or close to the real actual
results as much as possible.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12921-0
02:00:35.778 --> 02:00:41.799
<v Hou, Eric>That is our goal,
no matter how we quantify the difference</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12921-1
02:00:41.799 --> 02:00:49.249
<v Hou, Eric>between our outcome from the either
neural network for different models,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12921-2
02:00:49.249 --> 02:00:51.698
<v Hou, Eric>we want that quantified.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12928-0
02:00:52.348 --> 02:00:54.508
<v Hou, Eric>Error to be as small as possible.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12954-0
02:00:55.098 --> 02:00:58.431
<v Hou, Eric>Well,
we want it as more as possible from our</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12954-1
02:00:58.431 --> 02:01:03.794
<v Hou, Eric>train set and then we also want the
quantified error as small as possible</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12954-2
02:01:03.794 --> 02:01:05.098
<v Hou, Eric>from our test set.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12962-0
02:01:05.498 --> 02:01:08.658
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then that will be the optimal case?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12968-0
02:01:08.658 --> 02:01:10.738
<v Hou, Eric>That was that is our goal.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12994-0
02:01:10.818 --> 02:01:17.946
<v Hou, Eric>So then we want to have a side of those
weights to help that achieve the goal to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/12994-1
02:01:17.946 --> 02:01:24.458
<v Hou, Eric>minimize the training test error,
the training error and the test errors.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13001-0
02:01:24.818 --> 02:01:27.898
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why we need to set.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13010-0
02:01:27.938 --> 02:01:32.538
<v Hou, Eric>We need to find the best set of weights,
but in theory you can choose.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13013-0
02:01:33.228 --> 02:01:33.868
<v Hou, Eric>Your set of ways.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13020-0
02:01:34.298 --> 02:01:38.658
<v Hou, Eric>Which usually are not optimal, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13040-0
02:01:40.548 --> 02:01:48.207
<v Hou, Eric>There are two ways we can do is there is
a scientific reason that we can seek a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13040-1
02:01:48.207 --> 02:01:52.228
<v Hou, Eric>learning method that real neurons can use.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13067-0
02:01:53.908 --> 02:01:59.631
<v Hou, Eric>And and engineer reason is we need a
method to generate the multi layer</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13067-1
02:01:59.631 --> 02:02:05.513
<v Hou, Eric>nonlinear new networks and then and then
the the scientific reason or the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13067-2
02:02:05.513 --> 02:02:06.308
<v Hou, Eric>analytics.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13069-0
02:02:06.578 --> 02:02:07.458
<v Hou, Eric>Solution is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13096-0
02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:13.136
<v Hou, Eric>So the scientific reason we want to find
a formula and then we just analyze the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13096-1
02:02:13.136 --> 02:02:15.988
<v Hou, Eric>formula. OK,
so then we can find the best set of ways.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13118-0
02:02:16.268 --> 02:02:23.386
<v Hou, Eric>The engineering reason is we may not have
to depend on rely on that specific</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13118-1
02:02:23.386 --> 02:02:28.748
<v Hou, Eric>formula for us to find the set of ways
the difference is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13137-0
02:02:31.098 --> 02:02:38.036
<v Hou, Eric>The the scientific or analytic way of
finding the best weight is let's just</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13137-1
02:02:38.036 --> 02:02:38.858
<v Hou, Eric>generate.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13156-0
02:02:40.348 --> 02:02:45.346
<v Hou, Eric>The formula of it we want to know that
every single detail of it and then and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13156-1
02:02:45.346 --> 02:02:46.628
<v Hou, Eric>then we put it into.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13178-0
02:02:49.108 --> 02:02:55.723
<v Hou, Eric>A summation of square error function and
then we can take the derivatives and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13178-1
02:02:55.723 --> 02:02:59.868
<v Hou, Eric>hopefully those those ways are also
differentiable.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13180-0
02:02:59.868 --> 02:03:00.348
<v Hou, Eric>So then we can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13208-0
02:03:00.738 --> 02:03:04.361
<v Hou, Eric>Eventually converted to a math problem
and can definitely solve it,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13208-1
02:03:04.361 --> 02:03:07.237
<v Hou, Eric>and then eventually the outcome is a set
of formulas.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13208-2
02:03:07.237 --> 02:03:11.393
<v Hou, Eric>Whenever we see the similar problem,
we just assign the value to the formulas</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13208-3
02:03:11.393 --> 02:03:12.458
<v Hou, Eric>we have the answers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13217-0
02:03:13.468 --> 02:03:15.148
<v Hou, Eric>The the engineering way.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13260-0
02:03:15.148 --> 02:03:22.482
<v Hou, Eric>Isn't that so that it is possible that we
do not know how exactly those formula</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13260-1
02:03:22.482 --> 02:03:27.066
<v Hou, Eric>look like.
We may not know every single detail of</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13260-2
02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:33.208
<v Hou, Eric>those formula, but we can,
through our engineering process to have</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13260-3
02:03:33.208 --> 02:03:38.708
<v Hou, Eric>approximation of your best answer by
through iterations of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13267-0
02:03:39.548 --> 02:03:42.548
<v Hou, Eric>A process finding optimizing the weights.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13288-0
02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:48.978
<v Hou, Eric>So the difference is,
do we have to rely on subsid formula for</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13288-1
02:03:48.978 --> 02:03:50.818
<v Hou, Eric>scientific analytics?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13298-0
02:03:50.898 --> 02:03:55.019
<v Hou, Eric>The answer is yes,
but for engineered the answer is we may</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13298-1
02:03:55.019 --> 02:03:55.298
<v Hou, Eric>not.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13336-0
02:03:55.618 --> 02:03:58.798
<v Hou, Eric>And then for analytic or scientific
approach,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13336-1
02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:04.466
<v Hou, Eric>we want to convert it to a math problem
and know exactly formula so that later on</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13336-2
02:04:04.466 --> 02:04:10.065
<v Hou, Eric>we can rely on a formula that still going
to be the code unco best case scenario</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13336-3
02:04:10.065 --> 02:04:10.618
<v Hou, Eric>because.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13343-0
02:04:11.828 --> 02:04:14.508
<v Hou, Eric>Because engineering process going to take
time.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13367-0
02:04:14.898 --> 02:04:20.082
<v Hou, Eric>I'm gonna take effort gonna take umm
computational effort to to achieve the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13367-1
02:04:20.082 --> 02:04:25.538
<v Hou, Eric>same uh result that analytic can achieve
in one second if you know the formula.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13372-0
02:04:26.098 --> 02:04:28.098
<v Hou, Eric>But a lot of times you don't.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13392-0
02:04:28.298 --> 02:04:35.228
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have to run iterations to get
your result as close to the the code unco</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13392-1
02:04:35.228 --> 02:04:37.538
<v Hou, Eric>analytic result as possible.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13397-0
02:04:37.538 --> 02:04:39.778
<v Hou, Eric>So that is really the engineering
approach.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13408-0
02:04:40.828 --> 02:04:44.628
<v Hou, Eric>And and and and as you can imagine in the
neural network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13419-0
02:04:45.338 --> 02:04:51.658
<v Hou, Eric>World will definitely use the engineering
approach, right? So let's see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13427-0
02:04:53.148 --> 02:04:54.268
<v Hou, Eric>Let's try this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13431-0
02:04:54.268 --> 02:04:57.348
<v Hou, Eric>So let's let's try this example, right.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13433-0
02:04:57.348 --> 02:04:59.108
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13444-0
02:05:01.278 --> 02:05:04.278
<v Hou, Eric>You went to a mysterious cafeteria, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13445-0
02:05:04.278 --> 02:05:05.838
<v Hou, Eric>So then for that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13458-0
02:05:05.838 --> 02:05:09.423
<v Hou, Eric>For whatever reason,
that cafeteria does not tell you the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13458-1
02:05:09.423 --> 02:05:11.278
<v Hou, Eric>individual item prices, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13466-0
02:05:11.278 --> 02:05:15.478
<v Hou, Eric>So then you always like me.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13473-0
02:05:15.558 --> 02:05:20.078
<v Hou, Eric>I you always, as I say me,
I always order three things.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13481-0
02:05:21.548 --> 02:05:23.068
<v Hou, Eric>Burger chips and drink, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13494-0
02:05:23.068 --> 02:05:27.548
<v Hou, Eric>So then the day one, I order two burgers,
one ship and one drink.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13499-0
02:05:27.748 --> 02:05:30.428
<v Hou, Eric>I pay the $1212.96.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13502-0
02:05:31.298 --> 02:05:32.908
<v Hou, Eric>Day 2.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13512-0
02:05:32.908 --> 02:05:34.778
<v Hou, Eric>I I purchased one Burger,
2 chips and two drinks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13529-0
02:05:34.778 --> 02:05:39.185
<v Hou, Eric>I paid this $10.95 day three.
I order three burgers,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13529-1
02:05:39.185 --> 02:05:41.098
<v Hou, Eric>one chip and one drink.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13537-0
02:05:41.098 --> 02:05:45.738
<v Hou, Eric>I pay $1795 day for the 421.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13540-0
02:05:45.818 --> 02:05:48.618
<v Hou, Eric>I paid about almost $25.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13545-0
02:05:49.618 --> 02:05:52.858
<v Hou, Eric>Can you use this table?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13578-0
02:05:53.938 --> 02:05:58.872
<v Hou, Eric>To figure it out, the price for each item,
for example,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13578-1
02:05:58.872 --> 02:06:06.185
<v Hou, Eric>how much does one single burger cost you
and how much does one single bag of chips</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13578-2
02:06:06.185 --> 02:06:13.058
<v Hou, Eric>cost you and how much does 1 bottle of
drink cost you using this information?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13589-0
02:06:15.088 --> 02:06:18.881
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then and then hopefully you can find</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13589-1
02:06:18.881 --> 02:06:19.688
<v Hou, Eric>an answer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13602-0
02:06:19.768 --> 02:06:23.610
<v Hou, Eric>So now I gonna do the.
I'm gonna steal you guys into different</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13602-1
02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:25.988
<v Hou, Eric>rooms and then you can figure this out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13607-0
02:06:28.898 --> 02:06:30.418
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just send.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13634-0
02:06:32.148 --> 02:06:37.696
<v Hou, Eric>Maybe we can just pause while so then you
guys can take a screenshot of this table</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13634-1
02:06:37.696 --> 02:06:42.308
<v Hou, Eric>which going to be your inputs Yu for your
discussion. Right so then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13637-0
02:06:44.068 --> 02:06:44.428
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13644-0
02:06:46.258 --> 02:06:48.178
<v Hou, Eric>Let's just pass it like 10 seconds.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13652-0
02:06:48.178 --> 02:06:50.818
<v Hou, Eric>So then you guys can take a screenshot of
this one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13655-0
02:06:51.138 --> 02:06:52.418
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully you can see this table.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13663-0
02:06:59.388 --> 02:07:02.188
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So then you guys can design?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13682-0
02:07:03.708 --> 02:07:09.483
<v Hou, Eric>Your way to find out the burger and chips
and the cost of burger and chips and and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13682-1
02:07:09.483 --> 02:07:10.388
<v Hou, Eric>drink, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13686-0
02:07:10.668 --> 02:07:12.428
<v Hou, Eric>So do you have the screenshot yet?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13689-0
02:07:17.328 --> 02:07:17.728
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13690-0
02:07:18.408 --> 02:07:18.448
<v Hou, Eric>I.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13699-0
02:07:18.448 --> 02:07:20.088
<v Hou, Eric>I guess assignments means yes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13706-0
02:07:20.248 --> 02:07:24.208
<v Hou, Eric>So now let's just do the rooms and then
so you guys can discuss.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13708-0
02:07:27.638 --> 02:07:28.518
<v Hou, Eric>Good luck.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13818-0
02:17:33.578 --> 02:17:34.578
<v Teske, Benjamin>Yeah, that'd be awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13826-0
02:17:37.368 --> 02:17:39.248
<v Hou, Eric>Do do you guys have any luck?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13830-0
02:17:39.648 --> 02:17:40.768
<v Hou, Eric>Did you guys figure it out?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13832-0
02:17:40.768 --> 02:17:42.568
<v Hou, Eric>The cost per.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13835-0
02:17:43.098 --> 02:17:43.898
<v Hou, Eric>Each kind of food.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13844-0
02:17:47.718 --> 02:17:48.118
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yep.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13839-0
02:17:48.818 --> 02:17:49.458
<v Hou, Eric>Oh good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13845-0
02:17:49.458 --> 02:17:51.458
<v Hou, Eric>How did you guys figure that out?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13864-0
02:17:53.568 --> 02:17:57.675
<v Benbenek, MATT>Well,
you can look at day one versus day three</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13864-1
02:17:57.675 --> 02:18:02.568
<v Benbenek, MATT>to figure out the price of the burger and
then day one.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13866-0
02:18:02.638 --> 02:18:03.518
<v Hou, Eric>Three, yes.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13872-0
02:18:04.618 --> 02:18:07.138
<v Benbenek, MATT>Yep, and that was 499.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13883-0
02:18:07.138 --> 02:18:12.698
<v Benbenek, MATT>And then you can look at day one and day
five to figure out the price of the drink.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13904-0
02:18:14.118 --> 02:18:18.263
<v Benbenek, MATT>And then you can once you have those two,
you can just solve any of the days to get</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13900-0
02:18:17.698 --> 02:18:18.338
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13904-1
02:18:18.263 --> 02:18:19.398
<v Benbenek, MATT>the price of the chips.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13905-0
02:18:19.808 --> 02:18:19.968
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13910-0
02:18:19.968 --> 02:18:20.848
<v Hou, Eric>That's that's awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13915-0
02:18:20.848 --> 02:18:26.768
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah. So so yes, that's totally correct,
right. So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13927-0
02:18:28.488 --> 02:18:33.288
<v Hou, Eric>Is that the only thought that you guys
have any any other plan?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13934-0
02:18:38.418 --> 02:18:41.018
<v Hou, Eric>That's totally great. Great idea, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13944-0
02:18:41.018 --> 02:18:43.178
<v Hou, Eric>So then you have this day,
one you have day three.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13951-0
02:18:43.178 --> 02:18:45.978
<v Hou, Eric>So then the only difference is 1 burger.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13956-0
02:18:45.978 --> 02:18:46.938
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can figure it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13968-0
02:18:46.938 --> 02:18:51.458
<v Hou, Eric>That burger is pretty much like $5 or 499,
right? So this is awesome.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13974-0
02:18:51.458 --> 02:18:53.298
<v Hou, Eric>And then you have that figured it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/13975-0
02:18:53.298 --> 02:18:54.138
<v Hou, Eric>You can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14010-0
02:18:54.818 --> 02:18:58.903
<v Hou, Eric>You can use the day one versus day four
so you can figure it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14010-1
02:18:58.903 --> 02:19:04.040
<v Hou, Eric>You know how one ship is really cost you
and then and then you just plug in like a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14010-2
02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:06.578
<v Hou, Eric>burger chip and then you can have drinks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14012-0
02:19:06.658 --> 02:19:07.568
<v Hou, Eric>That's a great plan.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14049-0
02:19:08.118 --> 02:19:11.910
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then that is the the scientific</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14049-1
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:18.229
<v Hou, Eric>approach, this sort of analytic approach,
analytic approach solution.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14049-2
02:19:18.229 --> 02:19:24.278
<v Hou, Eric>You know you compare those formulas and
then and then you do some.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14055-0
02:19:25.848 --> 02:19:26.968
<v Hou, Eric>Linear algebra.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14069-0
02:19:26.968 --> 02:19:30.668
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can solve the equation,
the system equations and then you can</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14069-1
02:19:30.668 --> 02:19:31.368
<v Hou, Eric>figure it out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14073-0
02:19:33.208 --> 02:19:33.808
<v Hou, Eric>Each of them is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14077-0
02:19:35.688 --> 02:19:36.368
<v Hou, Eric>So that's great.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14114-0
02:19:36.998 --> 02:19:40.057
<v Hou, Eric>However,
if you do have those burgers and chips</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14114-1
02:19:40.057 --> 02:19:44.773
<v Hou, Eric>and drinks and then for example,
I can stand this list and then that will</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14114-2
02:19:44.773 --> 02:19:48.023
<v Hou, Eric>be really,
really hard for you guys to figure this</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14114-3
02:19:48.023 --> 02:19:48.278
<v Hou, Eric>out.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14127-0
02:19:48.278 --> 02:19:53.558
<v Hou, Eric>And I I I gave you 5 days and technically
unknowns are only three.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14145-0
02:19:53.558 --> 02:19:56.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then you can definitely figure it out
this answer,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14145-1
02:19:56.438 --> 02:20:00.758
<v Hou, Eric>but if the data is getting more and more
complex and getting more and more data,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14145-2
02:20:00.758 --> 02:20:02.198
<v Hou, Eric>it wouldn't be able to use.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14157-0
02:20:02.968 --> 02:20:06.283
<v Hou, Eric>The linear algebra to solve the problem
but but with that being said and then</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14157-1
02:20:06.283 --> 02:20:07.048
<v Hou, Eric>it's a great idea.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14170-0
02:20:08.208 --> 02:20:11.128
<v Hou, Eric>We now we have 2 approaches, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14182-0
02:20:11.128 --> 02:20:17.608
<v Hou, Eric>So then either we can teach AI how to use
a linear algebra or.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14199-0
02:20:18.838 --> 02:20:23.679
<v Hou, Eric>To solve a bigger system of equations for
us or we we we figure out another way,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14199-1
02:20:23.679 --> 02:20:24.038
<v Hou, Eric>right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14219-0
02:20:24.038 --> 02:20:29.516
<v Hou, Eric>So then as you can see,
the current opening I isn't so great at</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14219-1
02:20:29.516 --> 02:20:31.998
<v Hou, Eric>solving the system equations.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14230-0
02:20:32.238 --> 02:20:36.078
<v Hou, Eric>So then that way is definitely one
approach where it's boring.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14248-0
02:20:36.078 --> 02:20:42.406
<v Hou, Eric>Another way is can we try a different way
to to to do this and then this is one</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14248-1
02:20:42.406 --> 02:20:46.598
<v Hou, Eric>example that you know I gonna remind you
guys again.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14250-0
02:20:47.408 --> 02:20:47.808
<v Hou, Eric>The.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14258-0
02:20:48.638 --> 02:20:51.438
<v Hou, Eric>The the gradient descent right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14265-0
02:20:51.438 --> 02:20:55.598
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just go back to the gradient
descent slide.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14270-0
02:20:57.008 --> 02:20:58.288
<v Hou, Eric>Hopefully I still have it here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14281-0
02:21:01.668 --> 02:21:06.188
<v Hou, Eric>This is one problem we can all we can
solve it by gradient descent again.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14298-0
02:21:07.648 --> 02:21:11.575
<v Hou, Eric>Right.
So then I just create this excel just</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14298-1
02:21:11.575 --> 02:21:14.368
<v Hou, Eric>while you guys are thinking, OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14301-0
02:21:14.848 --> 02:21:17.808
<v Hou, Eric>So then let me just hide those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14305-0
02:21:20.788 --> 02:21:21.948
<v Hou, Eric>Let me just hide those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14311-0
02:21:25.298 --> 02:21:27.418
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is a beast.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14317-0
02:21:28.218 --> 02:21:31.178
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry this ABCD B is a burger.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14322-0
02:21:36.158 --> 02:21:37.398
<v Hou, Eric>I see your chairs.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14329-0
02:21:39.798 --> 02:21:44.878
<v Hou, Eric>Drink so that is how much you paid, right?
So.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14340-0
02:21:46.528 --> 02:21:50.488
<v Hou, Eric>So this is the the unit that the portions
that we bought.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14370-0
02:21:52.968 --> 02:21:58.405
<v Hou, Eric>So you guys are doing great job.
So then so that what I'm going to do is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14370-1
02:21:58.405 --> 02:22:02.502
<v Hou, Eric>I'm going to guess.
So then I'm just guessing like $1.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14370-2
02:22:02.502 --> 02:22:03.768
<v Hou, Eric>00 per burger is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14373-0
02:22:03.768 --> 02:22:06.248
<v Hou, Eric>So that would be great.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14382-0
02:22:06.848 --> 02:22:11.079
<v Hou, Eric>And $2.
00 per per one chip and then $3 per per</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14382-1
02:22:11.079 --> 02:22:11.608
<v Hou, Eric>drink.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14392-0
02:22:13.158 --> 02:22:15.638
<v Hou, Eric>Or or, you know I can just do 111.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14399-0
02:22:15.638 --> 02:22:20.158
<v Hou, Eric>Why not 111? OK,
so then so now I can guess.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14405-0
02:22:23.948 --> 02:22:27.388
<v Hou, Eric>I can guess the let me just DV those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14407-0
02:22:28.808 --> 02:22:29.048
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14412-0
02:22:33.828 --> 02:22:35.068
<v Hou, Eric>I can just repeat this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14415-0
02:22:35.068 --> 02:22:36.308
<v Hou, Eric>I mean, I don't need those.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14431-0
02:22:40.968 --> 02:22:44.375
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah,
I can discuss based upon my assumption.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14431-1
02:22:44.375 --> 02:22:46.448
<v Hou, Eric>Every single one cost $1.00.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14448-0
02:22:46.568 --> 02:22:52.128
<v Hou, Eric>So the I bought I bought 44 portions of
those and then I should pay $4.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14458-0
02:22:52.328 --> 02:22:59.568
<v Hou, Eric>Instead, I paid 1296 so that my era is is,
is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14464-0
02:23:00.928 --> 02:23:02.768
<v Hou, Eric>Eight $8.96.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14474-0
02:23:06.038 --> 02:23:08.878
<v Hou, Eric>And then I I'm calculating error squared
as well.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14479-0
02:23:09.238 --> 02:23:11.438
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm guessing the second one I
bought.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14490-0
02:23:11.558 --> 02:23:13.838
<v Hou, Eric>Five of them, five portions of them.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14511-0
02:23:13.958 --> 02:23:17.295
<v Hou, Eric>So then,
since every single portion costs $1.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14511-1
02:23:17.295 --> 02:23:22.518
<v Hou, Eric>00 and I got this $5, I have a $5.
95 as a error and then error square.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14514-0
02:23:22.518 --> 02:23:23.398
<v Hou, Eric>Is this so?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14517-0
02:23:23.398 --> 02:23:24.758
<v Hou, Eric>Then I just keep doing this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14532-0
02:23:24.758 --> 02:23:30.998
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have all the errors per day and
then I have a error squared.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14549-0
02:23:31.518 --> 02:23:38.411
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm going to calculate the
gradient per burger and chip and and and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14549-1
02:23:38.411 --> 02:23:39.318
<v Hou, Eric>and drink.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14559-0
02:23:40.008 --> 02:23:45.168
<v Hou, Eric>So I'm going to use if you guys remember
that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14562-0
02:23:58.918 --> 02:24:00.078
<v Hou, Eric>Summation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14569-0
02:24:01.608 --> 02:24:02.488
<v Hou, Eric>Of error function.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14577-0
02:24:02.488 --> 02:24:08.488
<v Hou, Eric>So then I have y -, Y,
hat squared and then my Y hat.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14601-0
02:24:10.168 --> 02:24:17.506
<v Hou, Eric>Is actually my price of burger Miles by
burger portion plus my price of shift</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14601-1
02:24:17.506 --> 02:24:21.928
<v Hou, Eric>modified by my cheap portion plus my
price of.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14606-0
02:24:24.008 --> 02:24:25.848
<v Hou, Eric>Drink modified drink portion.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14612-0
02:24:26.798 --> 02:24:30.518
<v Hou, Eric>So then my partial.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14617-0
02:24:32.218 --> 02:24:33.658
<v Hou, Eric>My derivative.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14621-0
02:24:36.158 --> 02:24:38.038
<v Hou, Eric>This is going to be my era.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14624-0
02:24:41.468 --> 02:24:43.028
<v Hou, Eric>My derivative.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14629-0
02:24:46.538 --> 02:24:50.338
<v Hou, Eric>Of E subject.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14633-0
02:24:52.048 --> 02:24:53.248
<v Hou, Eric>To my price.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14648-0
02:24:54.968 --> 02:25:04.008
<v Hou, Eric>B will be if you use chain rule that will
be -1 multiply.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14652-0
02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:09.098
<v Hou, Eric>Y -, y hat.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14658-0
02:25:11.708 --> 02:25:13.708
<v Hou, Eric>And I definitely have a 2 here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14671-0
02:25:15.168 --> 02:25:20.608
<v Hou, Eric>And multiply the partial derivative of Y
hat versus price B.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14676-0
02:25:20.648 --> 02:25:23.808
<v Hou, Eric>So then that will be my portion of
burgers.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14689-0
02:25:25.288 --> 02:25:28.728
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry,
so then I do the same calculation to here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14690-0
02:25:28.728 --> 02:25:29.528
<v Hou, Eric>So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14701-0
02:25:31.648 --> 02:25:34.448
<v Hou, Eric>Social with price C is the same formula.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14719-0
02:25:34.568 --> 02:25:41.819
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply the cheap portion and then the
price drink will be same formula and the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14719-1
02:25:41.819 --> 02:25:43.968
<v Hou, Eric>multiplying the drink K.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14723-0
02:25:44.488 --> 02:25:46.368
<v Hou, Eric>So now be my gradient.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14729-0
02:25:46.368 --> 02:25:49.168
<v Hou, Eric>So then I just pull this calculation here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14749-0
02:25:50.278 --> 02:25:57.905
<v Hou, Eric>So then my gradient associate with burger
will be and by the way, y -,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14749-1
02:25:57.905 --> 02:25:59.838
<v Hou, Eric>Y hat is my error.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14751-0
02:26:00.278 --> 02:26:01.918
<v Hou, Eric>So that means my error.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14764-0
02:26:04.168 --> 02:26:08.928
<v Hou, Eric>To multiply this number my error and
multiply my portion.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14776-0
02:26:10.648 --> 02:26:12.848
<v Hou, Eric>Of burgers. So that is my gradient B.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14777-0
02:26:13.928 --> 02:26:15.688
<v Hou, Eric>My gradient C is.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14784-0
02:26:17.408 --> 02:26:19.088
<v Hou, Eric>2 multiply by error.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14786-0
02:26:19.088 --> 02:26:20.848
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply my portion of ships.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14813-0
02:26:21.958 --> 02:26:28.578
<v Hou, Eric>My my gradient associated with the drinks
is 2 multiplied by error and multiply</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14813-1
02:26:28.578 --> 02:26:32.798
<v Hou, Eric>this drink portions so then I have those
prepared.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14816-0
02:26:32.798 --> 02:26:35.918
<v Hou, Eric>I just copy this assigned to.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14828-0
02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:39.608
<v Hou, Eric>Those values and then I calculate the
average.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14838-0
02:26:39.688 --> 02:26:45.008
<v Hou, Eric>This is average and I define my learning
rate equals .1.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14841-0
02:26:48.268 --> 02:26:48.588
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14846-0
02:26:48.988 --> 02:26:52.028
<v Hou, Eric>So now I'm just copy this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14866-0
02:26:53.688 --> 02:27:00.798
<v Hou, Eric>To here I'm going to define a new price
as the original price plus my learning</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14866-1
02:27:00.798 --> 02:27:01.248
<v Hou, Eric>rate.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14873-0
02:27:01.528 --> 02:27:05.848
<v Hou, Eric>Multiply my average gradient associated
with B.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14894-0
02:27:06.008 --> 02:27:09.843
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is my going to be my new
price.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14894-1
02:27:09.843 --> 02:27:13.934
<v Hou, Eric>This going to be this plus learning rate
mod Y.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14894-2
02:27:13.934 --> 02:27:17.088
<v Hou, Eric>This is going new price of the chips.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14904-0
02:27:17.888 --> 02:27:25.328
<v Hou, Eric>And this going to be this plus learning
rate multiply by D.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14909-0
02:27:27.088 --> 02:27:28.608
<v Hou, Eric>And this is going to be my price.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14912-0
02:27:37.468 --> 02:27:38.108
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14916-0
02:27:38.428 --> 02:27:39.868
<v Hou, Eric>So then by doing so.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14926-0
02:27:41.768 --> 02:27:44.728
<v Hou, Eric>I'missioning increase this error squared.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14933-0
02:27:45.088 --> 02:27:47.608
<v Hou, Eric>So then it's just not good.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14940-0
02:27:47.608 --> 02:27:52.608
<v Hou, Eric>So then I'm going to change the learning
rate to be a smaller number.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14957-0
02:27:58.148 --> 02:28:01.073
<v Hou, Eric>OK,
by changing the learning rate to a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14957-1
02:28:01.073 --> 02:28:05.948
<v Hou, Eric>smaller number as you can see I have this
error squared smaller.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14965-0
02:28:06.018 --> 02:28:09.538
<v Hou, Eric>I think that's that's just because my
original learning rate is too big.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14974-0
02:28:09.538 --> 02:28:12.938
<v Hou, Eric>So then we just surpassed that the, the,
the local minimum.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14983-0
02:28:12.938 --> 02:28:18.418
<v Hou, Eric>So then we have this prepared what we can
do is copy paste this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14986-0
02:28:19.988 --> 02:28:20.748
<v Hou, Eric>So this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14988-0
02:28:22.988 --> 02:28:23.228
<v Hou, Eric>So this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14993-0
02:28:25.578 --> 02:28:28.498
<v Hou, Eric>Sorry, one more nice to this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/14995-0
02:28:31.928 --> 02:28:32.568
<v Hou, Eric>To this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15004-0
02:28:35.018 --> 02:28:39.298
<v Hou, Eric>And so this so as you can see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15011-0
02:28:40.788 --> 02:28:41.908
<v Hou, Eric>As I'm applying this method.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15015-0
02:28:43.908 --> 02:28:44.508
<v Hou, Eric>My prize?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15033-0
02:28:44.508 --> 02:28:48.236
<v Hou, Eric>Essentially,
B is getting closer and closer to that</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15033-1
02:28:48.236 --> 02:28:51.748
<v Hou, Eric>499 and my prize trips and D are getting
closer.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15050-0
02:28:51.748 --> 02:28:56.796
<v Hou, Eric>Closer to the real prize,
the evidence of saying that is my error</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15050-1
02:28:56.796 --> 02:29:00.468
<v Hou, Eric>is getting smaller and smaller, right?
So then.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15058-0
02:29:02.268 --> 02:29:04.348
<v Hou, Eric>I do not know the formula.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15066-0
02:29:04.348 --> 02:29:07.628
<v Hou, Eric>I'm not as smart as you guys can solve
this system equation.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15076-0
02:29:08.538 --> 02:29:12.938
<v Hou, Eric>But I can still achieve similar goal by
doing this.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15087-0
02:29:14.428 --> 02:29:17.228
<v Hou, Eric>So what I can do is I can even copy paste
the entire thing.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15096-0
02:29:21.658 --> 02:29:24.898
<v Hou, Eric>So that as you can see,
I'm getting close there.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15104-0
02:29:28.368 --> 02:29:30.608
<v Hou, Eric>I'm really getting close to the real
numbers, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15114-0
02:29:34.028 --> 02:29:36.757
<v Hou, Eric>Yeah.
So then what you want is you just copy</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15114-1
02:29:36.757 --> 02:29:37.788
<v Hou, Eric>paste everything.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15117-0
02:29:39.468 --> 02:29:40.348
<v Hou, Eric>It's gonna speed up.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15133-0
02:29:45.408 --> 02:29:49.921
<v Hou, Eric>So then eventually you know,
you just minimize this error stuff,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15133-1
02:29:49.921 --> 02:29:52.768
<v Hou, Eric>but you know your learning rate is a .01.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15157-0
02:29:52.768 --> 02:29:56.423
<v Hou, Eric>So then later on,
the staff is getting smaller and smaller,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15157-1
02:29:56.423 --> 02:30:00.687
<v Hou, Eric>but eventually gonna converge to the
actual price for chips. For for,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15157-2
02:30:00.687 --> 02:30:02.088
<v Hou, Eric>for burger, for drinks.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15166-0
02:30:02.288 --> 02:30:07.448
<v Hou, Eric>So then this is what we called
engineering approach.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15178-0
02:30:07.528 --> 02:30:09.848
<v Hou, Eric>So that's really about like a number of
rounds.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15183-0
02:30:09.848 --> 02:30:12.268
<v Hou, Eric>You're running this and then you're
actually gonna achieve that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15185-0
02:30:12.418 --> 02:30:12.658
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15187-0
02:30:14.778 --> 02:30:14.858
<v Hou, Eric>Um.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15193-0
02:30:17.248 --> 02:30:20.128
<v Hou, Eric>That's another example using the gradient
descent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15202-0
02:30:22.778 --> 02:30:24.978
<v Hou, Eric>And that's exactly what we're talking
about.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15215-0
02:30:24.978 --> 02:30:31.298
<v Hou, Eric>So then in terms to determine that the
best weights you can definitely use the</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15215-1
02:30:31.298 --> 02:30:32.658
<v Hou, Eric>gradient descent.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15245-0
02:30:32.658 --> 02:30:38.246
<v Hou, Eric>This is a powerful rule that you can do
it and then also you can use gradient</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15245-1
02:30:38.246 --> 02:30:43.046
<v Hou, Eric>descent, logistic neurons,
logistic regressions and that will be a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15245-2
02:30:43.046 --> 02:30:47.058
<v Hou, Eric>little bit more than a regression problem
just because.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15256-0
02:30:47.788 --> 02:30:51.388
<v Hou, Eric>This sigmoid function you want to take a
take a derivative of that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15260-0
02:30:51.978 --> 02:30:54.458
<v Hou, Eric>That's somewhat complex.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15271-0
02:30:54.578 --> 02:30:57.778
<v Hou, Eric>But eventually this is going to be the
formula.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15283-0
02:30:57.778 --> 02:31:02.732
<v Hou, Eric>You can definitely use this engineering
approach to optimize your logistic</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15283-1
02:31:02.732 --> 02:31:03.458
<v Hou, Eric>regression.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15286-0
02:31:04.838 --> 02:31:05.158
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15303-0
02:31:05.478 --> 02:31:12.275
<v Hou, Eric>So why we want to use this alliterations
or why we prefer those iterations?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15303-1
02:31:12.275 --> 02:31:13.438
<v Hou, Eric>Is kind of a?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15308-0
02:31:16.018 --> 02:31:18.338
<v Hou, Eric>The obvious the reason is we.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15335-0
02:31:19.988 --> 02:31:24.871
<v Hou, Eric>May not know exactly how those formula
gonna look like and solving system</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15335-1
02:31:24.871 --> 02:31:29.424
<v Hou, Eric>equations is more computationally
expensive than running iterations,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15335-2
02:31:29.424 --> 02:31:30.348
<v Hou, Eric>unfortunately.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15362-0
02:31:32.148 --> 02:31:36.633
<v Hou, Eric>And and and then maybe another reason is
maybe we do not even need a perfect</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15362-1
02:31:36.633 --> 02:31:41.468
<v Hou, Eric>solution as long as getting close to the
real solution and we are happy with that.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15367-0
02:31:42.148 --> 02:31:45.628
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why and then and as you can see.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15373-0
02:31:45.978 --> 02:31:48.138
<v Hou, Eric>See from this example I'm showing you.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15384-0
02:31:49.948 --> 02:31:53.708
<v Hou, Eric>The drawback of doing this is,
you know at the beginning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15393-0
02:31:56.218 --> 02:31:58.538
<v Hou, Eric>At the beginning my the first round,
right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15405-0
02:31:58.538 --> 02:32:03.138
<v Hou, Eric>So I have that error squared is 684.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15425-0
02:32:03.818 --> 02:32:11.904
<v Hou, Eric>I can reduce it by 200 by adding one
round and a 204 hundred to two hundred</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15425-1
02:32:11.904 --> 02:32:14.138
<v Hou, Eric>280 to 100, so I can.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15436-0
02:32:15.588 --> 02:32:18.828
<v Hou, Eric>I can reduce this error pretty rapidly at
the beginning.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15454-0
02:32:20.918 --> 02:32:28.998
<v Hou, Eric>But towards the end of this table,
now I'm really reducing from 3:25 to 314.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15465-0
02:32:29.118 --> 02:32:33.325
<v Hou, Eric>So there's like only .11,
so that's four quite small error</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15465-1
02:32:33.325 --> 02:32:34.038
<v Hou, Eric>reduction.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15469-0
02:32:35.508 --> 02:32:36.708
<v Hou, Eric>So now how fast?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15474-0
02:32:38.348 --> 02:32:39.068
<v Hou, Eric>Your iteration gonna.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15484-0
02:32:41.748 --> 02:32:45.148
<v Hou, Eric>Cost or drive the convergence?
That's also a questionable.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15500-0
02:32:45.148 --> 02:32:50.593
<v Hou, Eric>So then there are some techniques that
you can change the the learning rate to</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15500-1
02:32:50.593 --> 02:32:52.868
<v Hou, Eric>drive higher quicker convergence.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15503-0
02:32:53.178 --> 02:32:56.618
<v Hou, Eric>Right. So that's why.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15518-0
02:33:00.928 --> 02:33:07.048
<v Hou, Eric>So there are some detailed reason why the
the learning can be slow.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15523-0
02:33:08.468 --> 02:33:09.348
<v Hou, Eric>Just because you know.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15538-0
02:33:11.028 --> 02:33:16.068
<v Hou, Eric>The actual error surface it looks like
this if you project it to a 2D dimension.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15550-0
02:33:17.788 --> 02:33:21.868
<v Hou, Eric>In a 3D it looks like a mountain or looks
like.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15558-0
02:33:24.468 --> 02:33:26.228
<v Hou, Eric>A dip so that would look like a hole.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15571-0
02:33:26.228 --> 02:33:32.228
<v Hou, Eric>So then you you have to find that the
correct direction to either grow up or</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15571-1
02:33:32.228 --> 02:33:33.708
<v Hou, Eric>down to the bottom.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15585-0
02:33:34.388 --> 02:33:38.238
<v Hou, Eric>And then that is somewhat hard.
So now you need to always change your</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15585-1
02:33:38.238 --> 02:33:38.788
<v Hou, Eric>direction.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15589-0
02:33:38.788 --> 02:33:41.348
<v Hou, Eric>So there. So then it could be slow.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15594-0
02:33:42.828 --> 02:33:43.708
<v Hou, Eric>So then there.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15612-0
02:33:43.708 --> 02:33:48.846
<v Hou, Eric>So that's why a lot of people prefer to
use, not a static learning rate,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15612-1
02:33:48.846 --> 02:33:54.548
<v Hou, Eric>but a stochastic learning rate to change
the learning to make the learning fast.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15628-0
02:33:56.228 --> 02:34:01.037
<v Hou, Eric>But this is one example that you can
certainly have analytical solution,</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15628-1
02:34:01.037 --> 02:34:01.828
<v Hou, Eric>but usually.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15640-0
02:34:03.788 --> 02:34:07.588
<v Hou, Eric>Engineering solution is cheaper and then
is is more preferred.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15642-0
02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:08.298
<v Hou, Eric>Word.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15646-0
02:34:09.338 --> 02:34:09.578
<v Hou, Eric>OK.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15651-0
02:34:10.058 --> 02:34:12.018
<v Hou, Eric>So let's stop here.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15666-0
02:34:12.138 --> 02:34:15.912
<v Hou, Eric>And next week,
we gonna start talking about a</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15666-1
02:34:15.912 --> 02:34:20.178
<v Hou, Eric>backpropagation.
As you heard from Lydia is a very.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15674-0
02:34:20.498 --> 02:34:22.858
<v Hou, Eric>Important technique in your network.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15681-0
02:34:23.098 --> 02:34:25.458
<v Hou, Eric>A final reminder for next week.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15693-0
02:34:25.498 --> 02:34:30.091
<v Hou, Eric>Next week will be see.
I'll be seeing you guys in person in</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15693-1
02:34:30.091 --> 02:34:31.698
<v Hou, Eric>March and university.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15695-0
02:34:31.778 --> 02:34:33.978
<v Hou, Eric>I'll send you guys and reminder.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15698-0
02:34:34.458 --> 02:34:35.618
<v Hou, Eric>During the weekend.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15713-0
02:34:37.108 --> 02:34:42.468
<v Hou, Eric>And then it's still same time 5:30 and
then we have a speaker whose name is Jeff.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15725-0
02:34:43.178 --> 02:34:46.858
<v Hou, Eric>And he's aceo of a financial advisory
company.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15737-0
02:34:47.218 --> 02:34:51.958
<v Hou, Eric>The name of the company, the Symphony.
And he gonna talk about how Symphony is</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15737-1
02:34:51.958 --> 02:34:52.618
<v Hou, Eric>using aiml.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15745-0
02:34:53.298 --> 02:34:57.418
<v Hou, Eric>You guys gonna learn a ton from from?
He's also.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15755-0
02:34:58.908 --> 02:35:02.548
<v Hou, Eric>One member on the OTHERWISEER board of a
finance department.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15770-0
02:35:03.578 --> 02:35:07.281
<v Hou, Eric>And then also,
we're gonna experiment like in person</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15770-1
02:35:07.281 --> 02:35:09.098
<v Hou, Eric>kind of experience, right?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15786-0
02:35:09.098 --> 02:35:13.729
<v Hou, Eric>So then I will see you guys first time
and last time in person next week and</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15786-1
02:35:13.729 --> 02:35:17.218
<v Hou, Eric>then I hope you have a great week and
then great weekend.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15788-0
02:35:17.418 --> 02:35:18.778
<v Hou, Eric>OK, bye.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15794-0
02:35:21.808 --> 02:35:22.288
<v Teske, Benjamin>It's Eric.</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15798-0
02:35:22.288 --> 02:35:23.128
<v Teske, Benjamin>Feel better?</v>

d6c67035-6008-4af9-9f7d-46eb5b513f2b/15800-0
02:35:22.688 --> 02:35:23.448
<v Severin, Noah>Yeah. Thank you.</v>
