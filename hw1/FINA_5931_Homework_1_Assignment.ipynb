This is an interesting correlation, as one would expect Tesla, a large cap company, to perform worse when small cap companies are outperforming large cap companies. One possible explanation for this strong positive correlation is that Tesla is still a rapidly growing company, and its return patterns may match those of other rapidly growing companies, many of which are small caps. The HML coefficient represents how Tesla performs relative to the value effect. In this case, the -0.7055 HML coefficient indicates a strong negative correlation with the performance of value stocks, showing that Tesla performs better when growth stocks outperform value stocks. This is not surprising as Tesla is one of the premier growth stocks on the market."

        "Cluster 2 includes stocks such as AAPL (Apple), AMZN (Amazon), JPM (JPMorgan), META (Facebook), MSFT (Microsoft), PFE (Pfizer), and XOM (ExxonMobil). These stocks exhibit moderate volatility and varying degrees of skewness and kurtosis. While they have relatively low to moderate volatility, they show more diverse return distributions. Stocks like META, demonstrate extreme kurtosis, meaning they tend to experience larger, less frequent price swings. This cluster represents a broader range of stocks that balance risk and return, with some stocks showing more consistent patterns and others having potential for larger, more unpredictable moves.\n",
