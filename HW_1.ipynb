    "## Problem 1: CAPM Model\n",
    "**Objective:** Estimate the beta of a stock using the CAPM model and analyze its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval**: \n",
    "   - Use the Yahoo Finance API to download daily adjusted closing prices for the stock of your choice (e.g., AAPL) and a benchmark index (e.g., S&P 500) for the past 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excess Returns**:\n",
    "   - Download risk-free rate data from a reliable source (e.g., FRED) or use a constant risk-free rate (e.g., 2% annualized).\n",
    "   - Calculate daily excess returns for both the stock and the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CAPM Estimation**:\n",
    "   - Perform a linear regression with the stock's excess returns as the dependent variable and the index's excess returns as the independent variable.\n",
    "   - Report the beta, alpha, and R-squared values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Interpret the beta and explain whether the stock is more or less volatile compared to the market.\n",
    "   - Plot the regression line along with the scatterplot of excess returns.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Problem 2: Fama-French Three-Factor Model\n",
    "**Objective:** Extend the analysis to the Fama-French Three-Factor Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - Download the Fama-French daily factors (MKT, SMB, and HML) from Kenneth French's website or another reliable source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excess Returns**:\n",
    "   - Use the same stock as in Problem 1 and calculate its daily excess returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Estimation**:\n",
    "   - Perform a multiple linear regression with the stock's excess returns as the dependent variable and the three factors (MKT, SMB, HML) as independent variables.\n",
    "   - Report the coefficients, alpha, and R-squared values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Compare the R-squared values of the CAPM and Three-Factor Model.\n",
    "   - Interpret the SMB and HML coefficients to discuss size and value effects.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Problem 3: Clustering Stocks\n",
    "**Objective:** Use clustering to group stocks based on their historical returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - Select 10 stocks from different sectors (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, JPM, PFE, KO, XOM, NVDA, META).\n",
    "   - Download their daily adjusted closing prices for the past 3 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Calculate daily returns for each stock.\n",
    "   - Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean return, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Normalize the summary statistics.\n",
    "   - Use k-means clustering to group the stocks into 3 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Plot the clusters using a 2D scatterplot (e.g., mean return vs. standard deviation) with different colors for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Interpret the clusters and discuss potential similarities among stocks in the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Instructions:**\n",
    "- Submit a Jupyter Notebook with the complete code and analysis for all three problems.\n",
    "- Ensure that plots are labeled appropriately, and all assumptions and interpretations are clearly stated.\n"
