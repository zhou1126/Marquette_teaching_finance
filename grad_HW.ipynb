    "## **Objective**  \n",
    "In this assignment, you will analyze financial disclosures from NVIDIA (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) by retrieving and processing SEC filings, performing sentiment analysis, and correlating insights with stock performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tasks**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Retrieval**  \n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with the **SEC EDGAR API**: [EDGAR API Overview](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces)  \n",
    "- Refer to the **EDGAR API Development Toolkit**: [EDGAR API Docs](https://api.edgarfiling.sec.gov/docs/index.html)  \n",
    "- Use Python to fetch **10-Q reports** for both **NVDA and INTC** from **2020 onward**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Cleaning**  \n",
    "- Extract and clean **10-Q** data using Python.  \n",
    "- The filings are in **HTML format**, requiring significant processing to extract meaningful data.  \n",
    "- Compare the extracted data against the original reports to ensure accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Extract Key Sections**  \n",
    "- For each **10-Q**, extract:  \n",
