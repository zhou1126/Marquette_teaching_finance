SEATTLE,10 de octubre de 2025/PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- En un momento en que Estados Unidos enfrenta una crisis de vivienda de escala histórica,Housing Connector, una organización sin fines de lucro impulsada por la tecnología, yZillow, la aplicación y sitio web de bienes raíces más visitado en Estados Unidos, han alcanzado un hito que redefine lo que es posible cuando la innovación se une a la urgencia para abordar la falta de vivienda. Juntos, han ayudado a que10,000 personas encuentren un hogar estable, con lo que han convertido la tecnología y la colaboración en una fuerza nacional para el bien.

Lo que comenzó en 2019 como una solución local en Seattle se ha convertido en unmodelo nacional para facilitar el acceso a la vivienda del mercado privado a poblaciones que tienen barreras para acceder. Mediante la plataforma de Housing Connector, y con la tecnología de Zillow, las organizaciones comunitarias pueden conectar fácilmente a personas y familias necesitadas con las unidades vacantes de los proveedores de vivienda que tienen criterios de selección ajustados,lo que cierra una brecha fundamental entre la disponibilidad de vivienda, el acceso y la necesidad humana.

""Detrás de cada puerta que se abre hay un equipo y una comunidad que se niegan a aceptar que la falta de vivienda es inevitable. Este hito demuestra que podemos reimaginar el acceso a la vivienda en Estados Unidos. Al transformar la manera en que el mercado privado interactúa con la necesidad pública, hemos demostrado que para resolver la falta de vivienda se requiere innovación, responsabilidad y el valor de hacer las cosas de manera diferente. No solo construimos una plataforma, construimos un movimiento donde la vivienda se trata como infraestructura, no como una respuesta a la crisis"", explica Shkëlqim Kelmendi, fundador y director ejecutivo de Housing Connector.

""Este hito es un poderoso ejemplo de lo que es posible cuando reunimos a los socios adecuados (gobierno, organizaciones sin fines de lucro y el sector privado), y todos ellos trabajan hacia un objetivo común: hacer que la vivienda sea más accesible para todos"", señaló Jennifer Butler, vicepresidenta de relaciones gubernamentales y comunitarias de Zillow. ""En Zillow, no vemos la vivienda solo como listados y datos, sino como personas, familias y futuros. Estamos orgullosos de impulsar una solución que responde a la urgencia de este momento y ayuda a que las comunidades prosperen"".

Desde su creación, Housing Connector ha pasado de ser una solución para una sola ciudad a unainfraestructura nacionalpara la estabilidad de la vivienda. La organización ahora opera en8 mercados de 7 estadosy planea llegar a15 mercados y 30,000 personasen los próximos tres años.

Al alinear los incentivos entre los sectores público y privado, el modelo de Housing Connector abordaambas caras de la falta de vivienda:

Con su diseño adaptable, Housing Connector proporciona una capa de infraestructura fundamental que complementa los sistemas locales de atención a la falta de vivienda, con lo que amplía la capacidad en lugar de competir por ella. Este doble enfoque crea unaresiliencia sistémica, que garantiza que las personas no solo encuentren un hogar, sino que lo conserven.

El mercado exclusivo de Housing Connector, integrado con la tecnología de alquileres de Zillow, simplifica lo que antes era un proceso abrumador para los administradores de casos con recursos limitados y las familias en crisis. La asociación aprovechalos datos de vivienda en tiempo real y la eficiencia tecnológicapara transformar las unidades vacantes en oportunidades de vivienda, y así cierra la brecha entre los propietarios y los proveedores de servicios con una velocidad y escala sin precedentes.

En un momento en que el financiamiento federal para la vivienda cambia y los sistemas públicos están al límite,la eficiencia impulsada por la tecnología es esencial.Con un costo anual promedio de $1,000 por hogar (en comparación con el costo anual de $40,000 del sistema público para mantener a un vecino sin hogar), esta asociación ofrece una solución escalable y de alto retorno de la inversión para un desafío profundamente humano. Al combinar la tecnología de primer nivel de Zillow con el diseño de Housing Connector, que se impulsa por su misión, esta asociación demuestra quela innovación y la empatía pueden coexistir y tener éxito.

Celebramos 10,000 historias y damos forma al próximo capítulo

Para conmemorar este hito de impacto histórico, Housing Connector y Zillow organizarán conjuntamente el evento""Puertas abiertas: un brindis por 10,000 historias""el9 de octubre de 2025,en Seattle. El evento reunirá a líderes del gobierno, la filantropía, las empresas, las organizaciones sin fines de lucro y la industria multifamiliar para celebrar las vidas transformadas y para visualizar el camino a seguir.

Mientras Housing Connector pone su mira en laescala nacional, el hito es tanto una celebración como un llamado a la acción: para expandir las alianzas, impulsar la inversión y reimaginar la vivienda como un derecho humano apoyado por la innovación del mercado.

Housing Connectores una organización sin fines de lucro impulsada por la tecnología que transforma el mercado de la vivienda privada en una solución que combate la falta de vivienda. Mediante alianzas con propietarios para eliminar las barreras para los residentes y conectarlos directamente con el inventario de viviendas vacantes, la organización aumenta el acceso a la vivienda para las personas más necesitadas y ayuda a mantener a las familias en hogares estables. Fundada en Seattle en 2019, Housing Connector ahora opera en ocho mercados de EE. UU. y se expande a nivel nacional. Obtenga más información enwww.housingconnector.com.

The litigation, filed in a Texas federal court,allegesthat Nutex collaborated with third-party billing firm HaloMD to submit ineligible insurance claims,misleading shareholdersand triggering substantial losses.

Hagens Berman urges Nutex investors who suffered substantial losses tosubmit your losses now.

Class Period: Aug. 8, 2024 – Aug. 14, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 21, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nutxContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

According to the complaint, Nutex and HaloMD engaged in a systematic effort to exploit the insurance arbitration process. The suit claims the companies submitted thousands of questionable claims, falsely certifying their validity to extract outsized reimbursements. These arbitration-driven revenues, the plaintiffs argue, were central to Nutex's reported financial performance but lacked long-term viability.

The complaint contends that Nutex's revenue model was built on unstable foundations, and that investors were misled by financial statements that failed to reflect the true nature of the company's operations.

The allegations gained traction after activist short-seller Blue Orca Capital published a report on July 22, 2025, accusing HaloMD of orchestrating a ""fraudulent scheme"" to siphon millions from insurers. The report cited lawsuits filed by Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, which claimed HaloMD overwhelmed the arbitration system with invalid claims.

Blue Orca warned that Nutex's reliance on arbitration reimbursements posed a significant risk, suggesting the company's stock could collapse to penny-stock levels. Following the report's release, Nutex shares dropped over 10%, reflecting investor unease.

Beyond the billing allegations, the lawsuit asserts that Nutex misrepresented its progress in addressing internal control deficiencies. Specifically, the company is accused of misclassifying stock-based compensation obligations—treating them as equity rather than liabilities—thereby distorting its financial position.

On July 24, Nutex issued a statement rejecting Blue Orca's claims and promised further clarification in its quarterly filing. However, on August 14, the company announced a delay in submitting its Form 10-Q, citing ""non-cash accounting adjustments."" The market reacted swiftly: Nutex shares plunged 16.39% the following day, closing at $92.91.

The situation escalated on Aug. 21, when Nutex disclosed in a Form 8-K that its Audit Committee had determined certain prior financial statements required restatement. The committee found that obligations tied to hospital development had been incorrectly classified, necessitating revisions.

While Nutex offered a broad overview of its arbitration practices, the lawsuit claims the company failed to directly address the core accusations raised by Blue Orca. Nutex emphasized that it was not named in the lawsuits against HaloMD, but critics argue this sidesteps the substance of the concerns.

The class-action suit seeks to recover damages for investors who acquired Nutex securities during theallegedmisrepresentation period. Plaintiffs argue that the company's public disclosures were materially misleading, and that the eventual revelation of its true financial condition caused significant investor harm.

Law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP is investigating the claims. Reed Kathrein, a partner at the firm, stated: ""We're examining whether Nutex's business model was predicated on questionable arbitration tactics and whether its financial reporting practices misled investors.""

Class Period:Feb. 26, 2025 – Aug. 8, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline:Oct. 21, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/aiContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

According to the complaint, filed under the captionLiggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuitallegesthat these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel's health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive.

The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%.

The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later thanOctober 21, 2025.

""We're focused on whether C3.ai's public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel's health was affecting the company's ability to close deals and meet financial targets,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

According to the complaint, Snap gave false assurances about the effectiveness of its ad platform and its potential to drive revenue. The lawsuit claims that the company was in fact experiencing significant negative consequences from a major ""execution error"" related to a recent change in its ad platform, but failed to disclose this crucial information to investors.

Theallegeddeception came to light on August 5, 2025, when Snap reported its Q2 2025 results. The company not only missed analyst estimates for its GAAP EPS but also disclosed that in its efforts to improve advertiser performance, it ""shipped a change that caused some campaigns to clear the auction at substantially reduced prices."" Snap also revealed a significant slowdown in ad revenue growth, from 9% in Q1 to just 1% in April. This news sent Snap's stock price tumbling by approximately 17% the following day.

So far in 2025, mining stocks are already soaring 135%[2]as companies capture extraordinary margin expansion while production costs stabilize, creating unprecedented profit leverage[3]that positions well-managed exploration and development companies to capitalize on this historic environment, includingRush Gold Corp.(CSE:RGN) (FSE: B6H),PPX Mining Corp.(TSXV:PPX) (OTCPK:SNNGF),Austin Gold Corp.(NYSE-American:AUST),K92 Mining Inc.(TSX:KNT) (OTCQX:KNTNF), andIdaho Strategic Resources, Inc.(NYSE-American:IDR).

Wall Street heavyweightGoldman Sachsraised its forecast to $4,900 per ounce by late 2026[4], citing sticky demand from Western investors and continued central bank buying that shows no signs of slowing. The convergence of accommodative monetary policy, geopolitical tensions, and institutional diversification away from traditional reserve assets creates compelling timing for investors to establish positions in mining companies before the next wave of institutional capital flows into the sector.

Rush Gold Corp.(CSE: RGN) (FSE: B6H) recentlyreleased a corporate updatehighlighting significant momentum in its first 90 days as a publicly traded company, with a completed financing and strategic land consolidation positioning the explorer in one of Nevada's most historically productive silver-gold districts.

The Vancouver-based company is advancing two adjacent properties in the Republic Mining District, Nye County, Nevada, a region that produced high-grade silver in the early 1900s but has seen limited modern exploration until recent years. The district sits along Nevada's Walker Lane structural corridor, which has hosted numerousmajor discoveriesand continues to attract significant exploration investment.

""As we mark our third month as a publicly traded company,Rush Gold Corp.is proud of the strong foundation we've built as a U.S.-focused mineral exploration company,"" said Anthony Zelen, CEO ofRush Gold. ""We are incredibly excited about the potential of our flagship Skylight property in Nevada, and the recent acquisition of the Legal Tender silver property which further strengthens our portfolio.""

The flagship Skylight property spans 330 acres and covers what geologists believe is a well-preserved epithermal gold-silver system, a geological environment where hot, mineral-rich fluids deposited precious metals underground and subsequent erosion has not removed the mineralization.Newmont MiningandRimfire Minerals Corporationexplored the ground as part of a joint venture in the 2000s, identifying it as one of their highest-priority targets before the partnership ended and the claims eventually lapsed.

Their limited drilling intersected gold in three of six holes, including 10.67 meters grading 0.49 grams per tonne gold, but the core target beneath a preserved silica cap remains largely untested. Recent technical work has added validation to the geological model. ASTER satellite imaging revealed a 1.2-kilometer alteration footprint at Skylight, precisely the type of large-scale geochemical signature that characterizes significant epithermal systems in Nevada. The technology identifies surface minerals associated with gold-silver mineralization, effectively mapping the hydrothermal system's potential extent.

The Walker Lane corridor has emerged as a major exploration focus following the discovery of over 16 million ounces of gold near Beatty.Blackrock Silverhas defined significant silver resources at Tonopah to the south, whileFortitude Goldis advancing the County Line Project toward production just north ofRush Gold'sposition, with numerous other explorers actively acquiring ground and initiating work throughout the district.

""Following the spectacular discovery of over 16 million ounces of gold near Beatty, exploration activity along Walker Lane has accelerated significantly,"" said Zelen. ""We feelRush Goldis strategically positioned within a highly prospective exploration corridor.""

Rush Goldhas consolidated its district footprint through therecent option agreementfor the Legal Tender property, located just three kilometers north of Skylight. The historic project covers most of the Republic Mining District and includes several early 1900s mine workings. Historic sampling has returned selective grab samples including 1,875 grams per tonne silver and 4.94 grams per tonne gold from old mine dumps, confirming the district's high-grade mineralization potential.

Coming off of closing itsupsized private placementat $500,000,Rush Goldnow has the capital to advance targeted field programs. Near-term work will focus on refining targets from ASTER satellite data and 3D geophysics at Skylight, while conducting systematic follow-up at Legal Tender's historic workings. The company's phase-gated exploration approach is designed to preserve capital while testing the highest-priority targets identified by previous operators but never properly drilled.

With gold trading above $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history, exploration projects in proven districts with strong technical merit and major company validation are attracting renewed attention. Lower-grade zones that were marginal at lower price levels can screen as economic at today's elevated prices, expanding the potential scope of viable targets. Nevada remains one of theworld's topmining jurisdictions according to theFraser Institute, offering established infrastructure, favorable permitting pathways, and a mining-friendly regulatory environment.

Rush Goldlisted on the CSEon June 23, 2025, raising $450,000 through its initial public offering at $0.10 per share. The company also trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under symbol B6H, providing access to both North American and European investors as it advances toward field programs at its Nevada properties.

The suit, filed in in the Eastern District of New York, comes after a dramatic stock price decline in August following the company's earnings report.

The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses tosubmit your losses now.

Class Period:May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline:Oct. 27, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/lfmdContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

The lawsuit, captionedJohnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7 and August 5, 2025. Itallegesthat LifeMD made false and misleading statements, particularly on May 6, 2025, when it reported its first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The complaint claims that the company's optimistic outlook, which cited a ""category-defining competitive moat"" in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand, was false as it misleadingly failed to account for crucial business challenges.

The suit contends that LifeMD was experiencing rising customer acquisition costs in its RexMD segment and a higher-than-anticipated refund rate in its weight management business, issues that it did not disclose to investors at the time.

Theallegeddeception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings per share estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited ""temporary elevated customer acquisition costs"" for its RexMD business and issues with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD's stock price plummeted by over 44%.

For investors who suffered substantial losses during this period, the lawsuit represents an opportunity to recover damages.

Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs' rights firm, is investigating these claims.

""We're investigating whether LifeMD knew of but failed to disclose key operational problems,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CASE DETAILS:According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the safety of Fly-E's lithium battery which in turn took a material toll on its E-vehicle sales revenue, despite making lofty long-term projections, Fly-E's forecasting processes fell short as sales continued to decline and operating expenses increased, ultimately, derailing the Company's revenue projections. On August 14, 2025, the truth emerged when Fly-E filed a form NT 10-Q: Notification of inability to timely file Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 revealing a substantial decrease of 32% in net revenues ""primarily driven by a decrease in total units sold."" In pertinent part, the Company attributed the decline to ""recent lithium-battery accidents involving E-Bikes and E-Scooters.""

From a closing market price of $7.76 per share on August 14, 2025, Fly-E's stock price fell to $1.00 per share on August 15, 2025, a decline of about 87% in the span of just a single day.

CASE DETAILS:According to the complaint, defendants disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts concerning the true state of VFC's turnaround plans; notably, that additional significant reset actions would be necessary to return the Vans brand to growth, resulting in significant setbacks to Vans' revenue growth trajectory. The truth emerged on May 21, 2025, when VFC reported its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results, highlighting a significant decline in Vans' growth trajectory, which faltered from an 8% loss the quarter before to a 20% loss in the fourth quarter, and noting such decline would continue through the next quarter. The Company attributed its results and below-expectation guidance largely as ""a direct effect of deliberately reduced revenue to eliminate unprofitable or unproductive businesses"" and ""an additional set of deliberate actions"" already in-place but previously unannounced. VFC further noted that, disregarding these deliberate actions, Vans would still have shown a ""high single digit[]"" revenue decline, suggesting growth slowed in comparison to the prior years' sequential improvements irrespective of management's new ""deliberate actions."" On this news, the price of VFC's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $14.43 per share on May 20, 2025, VFC's stock price fell to $12.15 per share on May 21, 2025, a decline of about 15.8% in the span of just a single day.

CASE DETAILS:According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Snap's advertising revenue growth rate; notably, that, due to Snap's own execution failure, it had significantly declined from 9% in the first quarter to only 1% in April.   On August 5, 2025, Snap announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, disclosing a deceleration in advertising revenue growth.

Increases were $14.0 billion versus $9.8 billion for Q2 2025 and $14.1 billion in Q3 2024. Decreases were $3.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion in Q2 2025 and $4.6 billion in Q3 2024.

For the 12-months ending September 2025, the net dividend rate increased $45.1 billion compared to the net $55.3 billion for the prior 12-months ending September 2024. For 2024 it was up $53.4 billion, 2023 was $36.5 billion, 2022 was $68.2 billion, and in 2021 it was $69.8 billion, with the 2020 net change negative as 43 S&P 500 issues suspended their dividends at -$40.8 billion. Increases for the 12-month September 2025 period were $57.5 billion versus the previous $74.7 billion, and decreases were $12.4 billion compared to $19.5 billion in the previous period.

""Dividend growth continued to be slow in Q3 2025, as concern over forward cash commitment was inhabited by the uncertainty over the evolving tariff polices, along with their impact on sales, costs and the general economy. Overall, companies continued to increase their dividends, but with smaller increases for those on a perceived schedule (annually). For companies not on a perceived schedule, many appeared to put off their actions for now,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Silverblatt continued: ""Given the start of tariff and policy clarity in Q3, companies may increase their payouts but still require more legislative and executive assurances for forward, long-term dividend commitments. Current tax and write-off benefits from the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' have added to corporate earnings; as expected increased tax refunds for consumers (starting in February 2026) has permitted increased sales expectations, giving companies short-term assurances but not the longer-term confidence for larger dividend commitment.""

Silverblatt concluded: ""Working with a base case for a higher-level resolution of economic related issues, lower interest rates from the FOMC, and continued U.S. consumer and equity support, Q4 dividends appear in place to set to a new quarterly record, with the full year S&P 500 payment expected to post a record level, nearing a 6% increase in dividend payments over 2024.""

On a per share basis, S&P 500 Q3 2025 dividend payments increased 1.7% to $19.81 per share from Q2 2025's $19.48 and were up 6.0% from Q3 2024's $18.68 payment. For the 12-months ending September 2025, the index paid $78.48, up 6.9% compared to $73.40 for the 12-month September 2024 period; for 2024 it paid $74.83 and in 2023 it paid $70.30.

113,2025-10-10,09:00 ET,"Mining Companies Print Record Profits As Gold Hits $4,000 MilestoneEquity InsiderNews Commentary – While gold's breach of $4,000 per ounce grabbed headlines this week[1], the real story is unfolding in mining company ...",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mining-companies-print-record-profits-as-gold-hits-4-000-milestone-302580753.html,"VANCOUVER, BC,Oct. 10, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Equity InsiderNews Commentary– While gold's breach of $4,000 per ounce grabbed headlines this week[1], the real story is unfolding in mining company balance sheets. Production costs have barely budged even as gold surged over 50% in 2025, creating what industry insiders call ""windfall margins"" where nearly every price increase drops straight to the bottom line[2]. Federal Reserve rate cuts and relentless central bank buying have removed the ceiling on gold's upside[3], putting companies likeRUA GOLD Inc.(TSXV: RUA) (OTCQB:NZAUF),Scorpio Gold Corporation(TSXV: SGN) (OTCQB:SRCRF),Thesis Gold Inc.(TSXV: TAU) (OTCQX:THSGF),Gold X2 Mining Inc.(TSXV: AUXX) (OTCQB:GSHRF), andKesselrun Resources Ltd.(TSXV: KES) (OTCQB:KSSRF).

With central banks snapping up 900 tonnes annually and Wall Street forecasting $4,900 gold by late 2026[4], the structural drivers supporting this rally show no signs of reversing. The math is simple: stable all-in sustaining costs plus soaring gold prices equals profit margins expanding at nearly twice the rate of gold's price appreciation, creating a rare window where established producers and early-stage developers alike can generate exceptional returns for shareholders positioned ahead of the next leg higher.

RUA GOLD Inc.(TSXV: RUA) (OTCQB:NZAUF) recently deliveredexceptional high-grade resultsback in September from its expanding Auld Creek project, including standout intercepts of 17m at 9.8g/t AuEq and 8m at 8.9g/t AuEq. These latest results demonstrate significant strike extension of the current resource, positioning the company for substantial resource growth by year-end. The company has also made promising regional discoveries, with rock chip samples grading 14g/t gold found over 30km south of Reefton.

""These drill results from Auld Creek have significantly expanded the scale and potential of the project and put us well on the way to growing the resource base as we announced last month,"" said Robert Eckford, CEO ofRUA GOLD. ""Importantly, the mineralized system has been extended both vertically and along strike and remains open in all directions.""

The company recently announced a major expansion to its Reefton drill campaign, mobilizing a third rig and targeting over 4,000 metres of new drilling at Auld Creek to grow the gold-antimony resource above 300,000 ounces by year-end.RUA GOLDalso has a third rig drilling at targets across the remainder of the district, focusing on highly ranking prospects highlighted by itsVRIFYAI targeting process.

With momentum building and results accelerating,RUA GOLDjust announcedan ambitious Q4 conference schedule that will showcase the company's high-grade gold-antimony story to institutional investors across three continents. The executive team will present at six major mining investment events spanning Munich, New York, Sydney, New Zealand, and Zurich throughout October and November.

""We're excited to showcaseRUA GOLDon this global stage and connect with some of the top minds in mining investment,"" said Eckford. ""With antimony supply tightening and gold reaching further record highs,RUA GOLDis positioned to be the next explorer transitioning to developer in New Zealand.""

The conference circuit kicked off at Munich Mining Conference on October 3-4, where CFO Zeenat Lokhandwala presented to over 1,000 German retail investors. The schedule continues with the Metals & Mining Virtual Investor Conference (October 7-9), Hidden Gems Conference in New York (October 20-21), and the International Mining and Resources Conference in Sydney (October 21-23), where COO Simon Henderson will representRUA GOLDwithin the New Zealand pavilion. The tour concludes with the West Coast Minerals Forum in New Zealand (October 30) and the prestigious Swiss Mining Institute Conference in Zurich (November 20-21).

TheReefton Goldfieldis a historically prolific district that produced more than 2 million ounces at grades up to 50 g/t.RUA GOLDnow controls 120,000 hectares (roughly 95%) in the area and has confirmed multiple stacked mineralized shoots at Auld Creek, including previous standout intercepts of 2.1 m at 64 g/t AuEq (5.5 g/t gold and 13.1% antimony).

Antimony continues to be a major tailwind for the company's positioning, with prices surging pastUS$50,000 per tonnein 2025 following China's export restrictions. New Zealand has formally designated it as a critical mineral, adding further significance toRUA GOLD'sdual-commodity profile. Surface samples have returned over 40% Sb, and several drill holes exceed 8%, grades rarely seen this early in a project's development cycle.

On the North Island, drill access applications have been submitted forRUA'sGlamorgan project in the Hauraki Goldfield, home to the 10 Moz Martha mine. Glamorgan's 4 km gold-arsenic anomaly has been refined usingVRIFY'sDORA AI engine, with drilling expected to begin in Q4.

With $14 million in cash and a leadership team behindUS$11 billion in prior exits,RUA GOLDis well-positioned to deliver meaningful discovery growth across both islands.

In other industry developments and happenings in the market include:

Scorpio Gold Corporation(TSXV: SGN) (OTCQB:SRCRF) hasannounced a maiden mineral resource estimateat its 100%-owned Manhattan District in Nevada, comprising 18,343,000 tonnes grading 1.26 g/t gold for 740,000 oz contained gold in the inferred category. The company also disclosed a historical mineral resource estimate covering satellite deposits at Black Mammoth, April Fool, Hooligan, Keystone, and Jumbo totaling 1,652,325 tonnes grading 5.89 g/t gold for 303,949 oz contained gold.

""The Maiden MRE represents the starting point for the newly consolidated 100%-owned Manhattan District, and does not yet incorporate any 2025 drilling by the Company,"" said Zayn Kalyan, CEO ofScorpio Gold. ""The estimates also highlight the high-grade nature of the gold mineralization, with grade being the key factor that distinguishes Manhattan from other open-pit assets in Nevada.Scorpio Gold'sobjective is to build a multi-million-ounce resource at a grade that sets it apart from peers – an objective we are well positioned to pursue with the team and capital in place.""

The maiden resource incorporates over 92,000 metres of historical drilling across more than 1,300 drillholes and does not yet include the company's 2025 drilling program, which remains underway. An NI 43-101 technical report detailing the mineral resource estimate will be filed on SEDAR+ and the company's website within 45 days.

Thesis Gold Inc.(TSXV: TAU) (OTCQX:THSGF) hasreported drilling resultsextending mineralization at the Bingo Zone of its Lawyers-Ranch Project in British Columbia, with drillhole 25BNGDD002 intersecting 89.30 m of 1.10 g/t Au from surface, including 12.00 m of 2.31 g/t Au, 3.47 g/t Ag, and 0.24% Cu beginning at 71.00 m downhole. The mineralization in this hole extends 30 m beyond currently modeled mineral resource domains and was abandoned ending in mineralization due to ground conditions, further emphasizing expansion potential.

""Our work at Ranch this year continues to underscore the project's potential beyond what is captured in the 2024 PEA,"" said Ewan Webster, President and CEO ofThesis Gold. ""Drilling at Bingo emphasizes that there is still room for growth in the Ranch portion of the resource. In addition, the IP survey has opened up an entirely new perspective on the central portion of Ranch.""

The company has completed an 86 line-kilometer induced polarization geophysical survey that has identified several compelling new targets beyond the resource zones. These exploration efforts build on the strong economics outlined in the 2024 Preliminary Economic Assessment, which demonstrated an after-tax NPV (5%) of C$1.28 billion, an IRR of 35.2%, and a 2.0-year payback period at US$1,930 gold and US$24 silver, with updated project economics expected in Q4 2025 through a Prefeasibility Study.

Gold X2 Mining Inc.(TSXV: AUXX) (OTCQB:GSHRF) hasentered into a definitive agreementto acquire all issued and outstanding common shares ofKesselrun Resources Ltd.(TSXV: KES) (OTCQB:KSSRF), with eachKesselrunshareholder receiving $0.02 in cash and 0.2152 of aGold X2share perKesselrunshare held. The transaction will result inGold X2acquiring a 100% interest in Kesselrun's high-grade Huronian Gold Project, a past-producing mine strategically located adjacent toGold X2'sMoss Gold Project in Northern Ontario, with existingKesselrunshareholders owning approximately 4.13% of the combined entity.

""The acquisition ofKesselrun Resourceswill mark a pivotal step forward forGold X2as we continue to consolidate a very prospective gold belt in Ontario,"" said Michael Henrichsen, President and CEO ofGold X2.

CASE DETAILS:According to the complaint, defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the timeline for the New Drug Application (""NDA"") submission and approval process for aficamten. Specifically, defendants represented that the Company expected approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") for its NDA for aficamten in the second half of 2025, based on a September 26, 2025 PDUFA date, and failed to disclose material risks related to the Company's failure to submit a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (""REMS"") that could delay the regulatory process. On May 6, 2025, during an earnings call, it was revealed that the Company had multiple pre-NDA meetings with the FDA discussing safety monitoring and risk mitigation but chose to submit the NDA without a REMS, relying on labeling and voluntary education materials. This confirmed defendants' awareness of potential REMS requirements and their reckless decision to omit it from the initial submission, misleading investors about the regulatory timeline. As a result of defendants' false and misleading statements, class members purchased Cytokinetics' common stock at artificially inflated prices and suffered significant losses when the truth was revealed.

CASE DETAILS:According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of C3 AI's growth; notably, that its Chief Executive Officer health was having a significant impact on the Company's ability to close deals, that its management was unable or otherwise ineffectual in minimizing that impact, and that C3 AI would not be able to execute upon its profit and growth potential as a result.  On August 8, 2025, C3 AI announced disappointing preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and reduced its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2026. The Company attributed its poor sales results and lowered guidance on ""the reorganization with new leadership"" and the health ailments of its Chief Executive Officer.   Following this news, the price of C3 AI's common stock declined dramatically.

Later disclosures reveal serious additional company problems.

The developments and severe market reaction have prompted national shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman to open an investigation into whether PetMed may have intentionally misled investors about its financial results.

The firm urges investors in PetMed who suffered significant losses tosubmit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/petsContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

The investigation is focused on the propriety of PetMed's repeated assurances to investors that its financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The company's assurances began to come under scrutiny on June 16, 2025, when PetMed announced that it would not timely file its annual report because it required additional time to compile and verify information and data required for its completion. PetMed also said that it expected to file its annual report within the applicable 15-day extension period.

Then, on July 1, 2025, PetMed announced that its Audit Committee commenced an internal investigation triggered by its receipt of a whistleblower complaint regarding the timing of revenue recognition with respect to certain autoship orders in Q4 2025, resulting customer complaints, and a Q4 2025 $50 coupon promotion to customers potentially impacting company key performance indicators.

Next, on July 28, 2025, PetMed announced the abrupt departure of its Audit Committee chair (Diana Garvis Purcel).

In addition, on August 11, 2025, the company announced that it would not timely file its quarterly financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2025, citing the need to complete the internal investigation.

The next day, August 12, 2025, PetMed announced that its CEO (Sandra Campos) and its CFO (Robyn D'Elia) agreed to resign effective immediately.

Finally, on October 7, 2025, the company revealed that its financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, along with the interim years' quarters and the quarters ended June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024 ""should no longer be relied upon.""

PetMed said that it overstated net sales by $6.969 million for the year ended March 31, 2024 and it overstated net sales by $9.01 million for the prior year. The company also said it accelerated shipment of autoship products to customers for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 to the quarter ended December 31, 2024 and again for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 to the quarter ended March 31, 2025. Moreover, the former Audit Committee Chair and former CFO did not report the whistleblower complaints to PetMed's external auditors on a timely basis.

As of October 9, 2025, PetMed has filed neither its annual nor most recent quarterly reports.

""We're focused on investors' losses and whether PetMed may have intentionally misled investors about its adherence to applicable accounting rules,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

However, Chinese factories report a strong rise in purchasing, pushing global manufacturing procurement activity up at the fastest rate since mid-2022. This expansion pushed Asia's supply chains to near-full utilization.

In sharp contrast, North American supply chains lost momentum. Manufacturers cited tariff-related delays and growing concerns about the economic outlook, leading many to hold back purchasing and reduce inventory buffers.

Meanwhile, Europe's supply chains remained underused, as manufacturers in Germany, France, and Italy reduced both purchasing and stockpiles. The region's supply-chain activity fell to its weakest level since March, extending its protracted industrial downturn.

""This is the new normal for global companies — higher prices, tariff pressure, and slower growth are here to stay,"" said John Piatek, Vice President, Consulting, GEP. ""For supply chain leaders who've been waiting to see how things settle: this is as stable as it's going to get — it's time to start executing their revised strategies.""

Interpreting the data:Index > 0, supply chain capacity is being stretched. The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are.Index < 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.

""Our Life Time Foundation's mission connects powerfully with Augie's Quest to Cure ALS, which fuels ALS research while encouraging those impacted by the disease, and our commitment to help children live healthier lives through movement and healthy nourishment completes this movement.

The Life Time Foundation was established by Life Time, Inc. in 2011 to inspire Healthy People, a Healthy Planet, and a Healthy Way of Life. Through financial grants and direct action, the Life Time Foundation supports Youth Nutrition by helping schools serve wholesome, nourishing, minimally processed food to students; Youth Movement by championing physical movement programs that get children active and excited to move for life; and a Healthy Planet by supporting forestation and conservation initiatives, so everyone can live healthy, happy lives.

Augie's Quest to Cure ALS is dedicated to supporting ALS research and empowering hope for a future without the disease by accelerating research, enhancing patient care and raising awareness in the fight to cure ALS. The nonprofit organization was founded by Augie Nieto, a former athlete who founded the organization in 2005 following his own diagnosis with ALS that same year. Nieto cofounded the fitness equipment company Life Fitness that many Life Time members are likely familiar with from using the machines in the company's athletic country clubs. After his passing in 2023, Life Time committed to supporting his legacy by hosting GO90 fundraising events not only for ALS research, but to honor movement for life.

Atkins, will be featured in an upcoming interview with Francine Lacqua on Monday October 13 with Bloomberg Television Europe'sLeaders with Lacqua. He will also be appearing on a segment of BBC NewsBusiness Todaywith David Wadell which will air later that same week.

These appearances come at a pivotal moment for the U.S. critical mineral industry and China's recent steps to restrict access to rare earths and critical minerals to the West.

A key focus of the interviews will be Ramaco's Brook Mine project in Sheridan, Wyoming. This groundbreaking initiative represents the first new rare earth mine to be developed in the United States in over 70 years, and the first new coal mine in Wyoming in more than half a century. The Brook Mine has attracted international attention following the discovery of high concentrations of the medium and heavy rare earth elements, as well as important critical minerals co-mingled within coal seams.

These media appearances follow Atkins' recent interviews on CNBC, Fox Business, and Sky News, and underscore his role as a leading voice in the future of American mining and critical mineral resource independence. Most recently, Atkins delivered a featured address at the 7th IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Gas and Coal Market Outlooks in Paris, France, hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). His speech, titled""The Renaissance of Coal in the Age of Carbon Products, Critical Minerals, and AI,""emphasized the transformative role of coal in modern energy markets and highlighted Ramaco's leadership in rare earth development and innovation in carbon technologies.

Ramaco Resources, Inc. is an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia, and southwestern Virginia and a developing producer of coal, rare earth and critical minerals in Wyoming. Its executive offices are in Lexington, Kentucky, with operational offices in Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. The Company currently has four active metallurgical coal mining complexes in Central Appalachia and one development rare earth and coal mine near Sheridan, Wyoming in the initial stages of production.

ABOUT MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER(MDD)MDD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide, impacting an estimated 332 million people – or about 4 percent of the population.8,9In 2023, approximately 22 million adults in the U.S. had at least one major depressive episode.10While depression is typically treated with a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, no two cases are the same. MDD is a complex, heterogeneous disorder involving multiple regions of the brain and presenting with as many as 256 unique symptom combinations.1,2As a result, responses to treatment vary widely. With current standard-of-care oral antidepressants, 2 in 3 people living with MDD continue to experience residual or persistent symptoms.11Moreover, MDD is a risk factor for the development and worsening of a range of comorbidities, illustrating the importance of integrating mental and general health care.12

Insomnia is one of the most common symptoms of MDD, affecting more than 80 percent of people living with MDD.13Disturbed sleep and insomnia symptoms have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and exacerbate the risk of depressive relapse and suicide.14,15

Approximately one-third of adults with MDD will not respond to oral antidepressants alone and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which is often defined as inadequate response to two or more oral antidepressants that were administered at an adequate dose for an adequate duration.16,17TRD has a significant negative impact on the lives of those affected and has one of the highest economic burdens of all psychiatric disorders.17Patients often cycle through multiple oral medications, waiting 4-6 weeks for potential relief.18Based on the STAR*d study, after trying their third oral antidepressant, approximately 86 percent of patients do not achieve remission.18

ABOUT CAPLYTA®CAPLYTA®(lumateperone) 42 mg is an oral, once daily atypical antipsychotic approved for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia, as well as depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression), as monotherapy, and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.

While its exact mechanism of action is unknown, CAPLYTA®is characterized by high serotonin 5-HT2Areceptor occupancy and lower amounts of dopamine D2receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses.

A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for CAPLYTA®as an adjunctive treatment for adults with major depressive disorder is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration review.

ABOUT SELTOREXANTSeltorexant, an investigational first-in-class therapy, is a selective antagonist of the human orexin-2 receptor currently being developed as an adjunctive treatment for adults with MDD with insomnia symptoms. Seltorexant selectively antagonizes the orexin-2 receptors, potentially improving mood symptoms and restoring sleep without next-day sedation in patients with depression.19When orexin-2 receptors are stimulated for too long or at inappropriate times, their activation can cause hyperarousal manifestations, including insomnia and excessive cortisol release, which may contribute to depression and insomnia.20,21Seltorexant is the only investigational therapy being studied in MDD that is believed to work by normalizing the overactivation of the orexin-2 receptors, thereby addressing the underlying biology that contributes to depression and causes insomnia symptoms.

ABOUT SPRAVATO®SPRAVATO®(esketamine) CIII nasal spray is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration alone or in conjunction with an oral antidepressant for adults with MDD when they have inadequate response to at least two oral antidepressants (TRD) and depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior in conjunction with an oral antidepressant. It is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and is believed to work differently than traditional antidepressants by acting on a pathway in the brain that affects glutamate. The mechanism by which esketamine exerts its antidepressant effect is unknown. To date, SPRAVATO®has been approved in 79 markets and administered to more than 150,000 patients worldwide.

ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIASchizophrenia is a complex, chronic brain disorder that affects how people think, feel, speak, and act. It affects up to an estimated 2.8 million adults in the U.S. yet remains widely misunderstood and insufficiently treated.22Symptoms vary by person, but confusion and distortions in perceptions, emotions, and behavior are common.23Evidence shows that the first three to five years after diagnosis – ""the critical period"" – from symptom onset are key for a patient's treatment, as this is when the condition progresses most rapidly.24,25A comprehensive treatment plan, which may include medication, therapy, and psychosocial services, can be critical in delaying the time to relapse for adults with schizophrenia.26

ABOUTJOHNSON & JOHNSON'S SCHIZOPHRENIA PORTFOLIOJohnson & Johnson's portfolio of schizophrenia therapies offers the broadest range of oral and long-acting injectable treatment options to support each patient's individual treatment journey. The Company's long-acting injectable treatments for adults with schizophrenia provides the most varied range of dosing options and the longest-lasting schizophrenia treatments with each dose available, including INVEGA SUSTENNA®(1-month paliperidone palmitate), INVEGA TRINZA®(3-month paliperidone palmitate), and INVEGA HAFYERA®(6-month paliperidone palmitate), all of which are administered in a clinical setting by a medical professional.23,24

CAPLYTA®is a once-daily oral therapy approved to treat adults with schizophrenia. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for CAPLYTA®with long-term data evaluating the safety and efficacy of the medication for the prevention of relapse in schizophrenia was recentlysubmittedto the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

CAPLYTA®(lumateperone) is indicated in adults for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.

Contraindications:CAPLYTA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lumateperone or any components of CAPLYTA. Reactions have included pruritus, rash (e.g., allergic dermatitis, papular rash, and generalized rash), and urticaria.

Warnings & Precautions:Antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause:

Drug Interactions:CAPLYTA should not be used with CYP3A4 inducers. Dose reduction is recommended for concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Special Populations:Newborn infants exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Dose reduction is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials with CAPLYTA vs. placebo were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth.

CAPLYTA is available in 10.5 mg, 21 mg, and 42 mg capsules.

(NYSE:MRP) (""Millrose"") for outstanding shares of Lennar Class A common stock (the ""Exchange Offer""). In February 2025, Lennar completed the spin-off of Millrose through a distribution of approximately 80% of Millrose's stock to Lennar stockholders.

The Exchange Offer begins immediately and will expire on November 7, 2025, unless extended or terminated. The Exchange Offer enables Lennar stockholders to exchange shares of Lennar Class A common stock for shares of Millrose Class A common stock at a 6% discount, subject to an upper limit of 4.1367 shares of Millrose Class A common stock per share of Lennar Class A common stock tendered and accepted in the Exchange Offer.

Lennar will determine the ratio at which shares of Lennar Class A common stock and shares of Millrose Class A common stock will be exchanged by reference to the arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of shares of Lennar Class A common stock and Millrose Class A common stock on the NYSE during the three consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, which are expected to be November 3, November 4 and November 5, 2025, if the Exchange Offer is not extended or terminated. The final exchange ratio, reflecting the number of shares of Millrose Class A common stock that tendering stockholders will receive for each share of Lennar Class A common stock accepted in the Exchange Offer, will be announced by press release by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the trading day immediately preceding the expiration date of the Exchange Offer (which expiration date, if the Exchange Offer is not extended or terminated, will be November 7, 2025). The final exchange ratio, when announced, and a daily indicative exchange ratio beginning on the third trading day of the Exchange Offer period, will also be available atwww.envisionreports.com/lennarexchange.

The Exchange Offer is being registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in a registration statement on Form S-4 (the ""Registration Statement"") filed by Millrose with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") today. The terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are contained in the prospectus included in that Registration Statement (the ""Prospectus"") and a tender offer statement on Schedule TO filed by Lennar with the SEC today. Copies of the Prospectus, together with documents with which to tender shares, are being sent or made available to all Lennar Class A stockholders.

The Exchange Offer cannot be completed until the Registration Statement becomes effective. The SEC has announced that during the current U.S. federal government shutdown, the SEC will not declare registration statements effective. If the shutdown does not end by the anticipated November 7, 2025 expiration date, Lennar will either have to extend the expiration date or withdraw the Exchange Offer. If the shutdown is still in effect at midnight on October 31, 2025, Lennar will announce by 11:59 pm on October 31, 2025 whether it will (1) extend the Exchange Offer and, if so, the extended expiration date, or (2) terminate the Exchange Offer.

The completion of the Exchange Offer is subject to certain conditions. Lennar can withdraw the Exchange Offer at any time before it accepts tendered shares.

Lennar currently owns 33,298,764 shares of Millrose Class A common stock as of October 7, 2025, representing approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of Millrose Class A common stock. Lennar is offering to exchange up to all of these shares for outstanding shares of Lennar Class A common stock. If the Exchange Offer is consummated but not fully subscribed, Lennar intends to dispose of the shares of Millrose Class A common stock that were not exchanged through a subsequent spin-off, split-off, public offering, private sale or any combination of these potential transactions. If Lennar stockholders tender shares that would entitle them to receive more shares of Millrose Class A common stock than Lennar owns, Lennar will accept only a pro-rata portion of the shares that are tendered by each Lennar stockholder.

The Exchange Offer is voluntary for Lennar Class A stockholders. No action is necessary for Lennar Class A stockholders who choose not to participate. No offer is being made to holders of Lennar Class B common stock, and such holders are not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are serving as dealer managers for the Exchange Offer. Vestra Advisors, LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Millrose.

The federal action triggered a sharp 19% drop in SelectQuote's share price on May 1, 2025, and has now led to a securities class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of investors.

The suit,Pahlkotter v. SelectQuote Inc. et al., covers investors who purchased SelectQuote stock between September 9, 2020, and May 1, 2025, andallegesthat the company misled the market about its business model and regulatory exposure.

Hagens Berman urges SelectQuote investors who suffered substantial losses tosubmit your losses now.

Class Period:Sept. 9, 2020 – May 1, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline:Oct. 10, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/slqtContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

At the heart of the complaint are claims that SelectQuote misrepresented its Medicare Advantage sales practices. While the company publicly promoted its services as offering ""unbiased advice"" and ""neutral plan comparisons,"" the lawsuit asserts that SelectQuote:

The DOJ's complaintallegesthat from 2016 through at least 2021, SelectQuote received tens of millions of dollars in improper payments and discriminated against less profitable customers by directing them away from lower-margin plans.

The DOJ's involvement sent shockwaves through the market, with SelectQuote's stock plunging nearly 20% in a single day. Over the past six months, shares have declined more than 40%, reflecting investor concern over the company's legal exposure and potential reputational damage.

The class-action lawsuit argues that SelectQuote's public statements failed to disclose material risks tied to its sales practices, leading investors to overvalue the company's growth prospects and revenue integrity.

Hagens Berman InvestigatesAllegedRevenue Manipulation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating whether SelectQuote's revenue was artificially inflated through deceptive conduct. Reed Kathrein, a partner at the firm, commented: ""The DOJ's intervention transforms this from a routine business dispute into a serious federal matter. We're examining whether SelectQuote's so-called 'unbiased' model was merely a façade for a kickback-driven sales engine.""

Mr. Brisby will work with the Company's current CEO, Stéfan Descheemaeker, for a transition period until Mr. Descheemaeker's retirement on January 1, 2026, when Mr. Brisby will be appointed CEO. Mr. Descheemaeker will continue to serve as a Director on the Company's Board following the CEO transition.

Mr. Brisby is an accomplished business leader with an excellent track record leading multiple companies in the consumer goods industry. Most recently, Mr. Brisby served as President of North America and Europe at Flora Food Group, a plant-based food company. Under his leadership, the business achieved its highest-ever market share in North America. In Europe he grew the business by developing a comprehensive strategic and tactical plan that transformed the P&L and enabled reinvestment in product innovation and brand relaunches to better align with consumer preferences. Prior to joining Flora Food Group, Mr. Brisby was Interim Co-CEO and Regional President at Imperial Brands, where he managed various regions with P&L responsibilities. Key accomplishments included reversing market share declines and implementing cost-saving measures that led to record profit growth in the U.S. market.

Mr. Descheemaeker, who has been the Company's CEO since its founding in 2015, will continue to serve as a Director on Nomad Foods' Board in a non-executive capacity beginning January 2026.

The Company successfully delivered nine consecutive years of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth through 2024 and, based on the Company's current fiscal 2025 guidance, Adjusted EPS is expected to have approximately doubled from 2016 to 2025 under his leadership.

Outgoing CEO Stéfan Descheemaeker said, ""I am proud of what we have built at Nomad Foods. The Company has become the leading savory frozen food business in Europe and one of the largest savory frozen food companies worldwide. We have built a portfolio of market-leading brands in an on-trend category while attracting top-tier talent which positions the Company to win. After 10 years as CEO, I believe now is the appropriate time to transition to new leadership who can take the Company to new heights. The Board and I have been planning my retirement and actively working to identify my successor. I am delighted that Dominic has accepted the offer to lead Nomad Foods beginning in January 2026, and I look forward to supporting him from my role on the Board.""

Noam Gottesman, Nomad Foods' Co-Chairman and Founder, commented, ""We are extremely grateful for Stéfan's leadership over the past decade and the role he has played in the succession process. Furthermore, we are pleased that he has agreed to continue to be actively involved with the Company as a non-executive Director. We believe the Company has tremendous growth potential ahead of it and we are excited to have a leader of Dominic's caliber and experience join us as the Company's next CEO. His track record of value-creation is impressive, and he brings a passion for brand building, innovation and cost discipline that we believe will position the Company for success over the next decade.""

Mr. Brisby, Nomad Foods' CEO Elect said: ""I am honored to be appointed as the new CEO of Nomad Foods. The Company has truly iconic brands that sit at the intersection of several big consumer themes. It is well aligned with the trends of nutrition, convenience, value and sustainability that are reshaping consumer demand. I look forward to working with my new colleagues at Nomad Foods to unlock the Company's full growth potential and deliver attractive returns to our stakeholders.""

The Forum was held on October 6–8, 2025, in Greenwich, CT, USA.

As one of the world's leading alternative investment forums, this year's GEF convened over 400 global fund leaders, academics, policymakers, and thought leaders. Key speakers included Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates; Nassim Nicholas Taleb, renowned author ofThe Black SwanandAntifragile; and Robert E. Rubin, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Senior executives from leading global institutions also participated in high-level dialogues on global investment trends. Noah played a pivotal role in connecting outstanding global product management professionals, fostering cross-border collaboration and innovation in alternative investments through high-level dialogues on global market trends.

Noah, ARK Wealth Management (""ARK""), and Olive Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited (""Olive"") — a subsidiary specializing in global alternative investments — participated in the Forum as global partners, where they shared their long-term, value-driven investment philosophy with an international audience, ultimately reinforcing their commitment to turning timeless principles into actionable strategies with global relevance.

Alternative Investments: Building the ""Resilience Engine""

The GEF not only benefits from Greenwich's legacy as the ""Hedge Fund Capital"", but has also established itself as a leader for alternative investing. As alternative investments become an increasingly critical strategic focus in today's market, the Forum serves as a dynamic testing ground where the world's most forward-looking investment thinking, risk management frameworks, and alpha-generating strategies are both implemented and validated.

Noah's expertise in alternative investments, particularly in multi-asset portfolios and thematic strategies in energy and AI, further highlights its capacity to create diversified solutions for international investors. This capability is reinforced by proprietary research, as demonstrated by key findings from theARK Wealth H2 CIO Report (""CIO Report""), which emphasizes dual narratives of technology-hedged deflation and policy-driven reflation.

The CIO Report advocates a low-correlation allocation framework to capture structural opportunities. To build durable portfolios that can withstand systemic equity volatility, managers may consider allocating to two types of alternative strategies: ""Volatility dampeners"" and ""Crisis alpha"". This combination acts as a built-in ""resilience engine"", enhancing the portfolio's overall stability.

In addition, bridge assets are identified as key to enhancing portfolio flexibility, highlighting a strategic mix of all-weather multi-strategy hedge funds, US dollar stablecoins, and short-term treasury bonds. This approach strengthens liquidity and agility, enabling Noah to help clients build portfolios that effectively balance stability and long-term growth.

Empowering Chinese Investors through Global Insights and AI Innovation

Alternative investments in private equity, venture capital, and other strategies now account for approximately two-thirds of Noah's AUM, reflecting Chinese investors' appetite for differentiated, long-term strategies.

Extending this commitment to innovation, Noah has launched its AI-powered wealth management platform, iARK, designed to deliver smarter, more transparent, and personalized investment experiences. Through AI portfolio insights, investors gain a clear view of product selection, allocation, and performance, making portfolio analysis intuitive and data-driven.

Prominent shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman has been investigating theallegedclaims.

The firm urges investors in aTyr who suffered significant losses tosubmit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

Class Period: Jan. 16, 2025 – Sep. 12, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Dec. 8, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/atyrContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

The suit,Munguia v. aTyr Pharma Inc., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California,allegesthat aTyr and its top executives made false and misleading statements about the efficacy of its drug, Efzofitimod, leading investors to purchase stock at artificially inflated prices.

The proposed class covers all investors who acquired aTyr common stock between January 16, 2025, and September 12, 2025, inclusive.

At the heart of the allegations is aTyr's Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, known as EFZO-FIT, which evaluated intravenous Efzofitimod in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The drug was intended to help patients reduce their dependency on steroids.

According to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, aTyr executives expressed overwhelmingly positive statements and confidence in the study's design, particularly its forced taper approach intended to gauge the drug's ability to allow patients to completely wean themselves off steroids.

However, the lawsuit claims that concurrently with these optimistic pronouncements, the company wasallegedlyconcealing material adverse facts concerning Efzofitimod's capability to allow a patient to completely taper their steroid usage—a key measure of efficacy. The lawsuit asserts that aTyr's statements crossed the line into securities law violations byallegedlymisrepresenting the drug's true prospects.

The truth, asallegedin the complaint, came to light on Monday, September 15, 2025. Pre-market, aTyr hosted an investor call announcing that the EFZO-FIT study did not meet its primary endpoint: the change from baseline in mean daily oral corticosteroid (OSC) dose at week 48.

The disappointing topline results prompted a swift and brutal market reaction. aTyr's common stock, which had closed at $6.03 per share on the preceding Friday, September 12, cratered to close at just $1.02 per share on September 15—a catastrophic one-day decline of 83.2%.

In its post-announcement comments, the company stated that it would engage with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine a path forward, acknowledging the setback.

Hagens Berman is investigating whether aTyr may have misled investors about its data and trial design while emphasizing Efzofitimod's multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. ""We're scrutinizing whether aTyr's previous representations about the drug's efficacy were materially misleading to investors,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the firm's investigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. At the time Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

NEW YORK,Oct. 9, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against PubMatic, Inc. (""PubMatic"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:PUBM) and reminds investors of theOctober 20, 2025 deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaintallegesthat the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that a top DSP buyer was shifting a significant number of clients to a new platform which evaluated inventory differently; (2) that, as a result, PubMatic was seeing a reduction in ad spend and revenue from this top DSP buyer; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On August 11, 2025, after the market closed, PubMatic released its second quarter 2025 financial report. In its report, PubMatic's Chief Financial Officer, Steven Pantelick, revealed that the Company's outlook reflects ""a reduction in ad spend from one of [its] top DSP partners."" The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Rajeev Goel, further revealed that a ""top DSP buyer"" had ""shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently"" causing significant headwinds. Goel stated, in response to the inventory valuation change, the Company would ""need to do a better job . . . to prioritize across all the hundreds of billions of daily ad impressions that we have, which subset of those impressions that we send to this DSP.""

On this news, PubMatic's stock price fell $2.23, or 21.1%, to close at $8.34 per share on August 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding PubMatic's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

NEW YORK,Oct. 9, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Quanex Building Products Corporation (""Quanex"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:NX) and reminds investors of theNovember 18, 2025 deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaintallegesthat the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company's procedures and policies regarding tooling and equipment maintenance in its Tyman Mexico facility were significantly ""underinvested""; (2) as a result, the Company's tooling and equipment conditions had significantly degraded to near ""catastrophic"" levels; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company was likely to incur significant costs, ""pushing out the timing"" of expected benefits from the Tyman integration; (4) that Quanex had previously identified the foregoing issues; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On September 4, 2025, after the market closed, Quanex announced financial results for the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. Among other things, the Company disclosed ""operational issues related to the legacy Tyman window and door hardware business in Mexico that are ongoing"" which ""impacted results more than expected during the third quarter of 2025."" Specifically, the Company reported a diluted EPS of ($6.04), compared to $0.77 in the prior year period and an adjusted EBIDTA of $70.30. The Company further disclosed that it was ""adjusting for lower expected volumes and pushing out the timing of when [it] expect[s] to realize procurement savings"" from the integration of the Tyman business.

Then, on September 5, 2025, the Company held an earnings call pursuant to the Company's third quarter 2025 financial results. During the earnings call, Chief Executive Officer, George Wilson (""Wilson"") explained ""operational challenges"" in the Tyman facility in Mexico ""negatively impacted EBITDA in the Hardware Solutions segment by almost $5 million in the third quarter alone."" Wilson further explained that the issue was previously ""identified midyear"" as it got ""deeper into the integration"" with Tyman, and described how the systems used to ""anticipate and plan for tooling repairs"" were significantly deficient, indicating it was near ""nonexistent."" Wilson stated because Quanex was ""underinvested"" in ""the tooling condition and the equipment condition"" it ""had to make some changes and fix some things before it was catastrophic.""

On this news, Quanex's stock price fell $2.73, or 13.1%, to close at $18.18 per share on September 5, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The stock price continued to decline on the subsequent trading day, falling $1.98 or 10.9%, to close at $16.20 per share on September 8, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

NEW YORK,Oct. 9, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Tronox Holdings plc (""Tronox"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:TROX) and reminds investors of theNovember 3, 2025 deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Tronox's ability to forecast the demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise the true state of its commercial division, despite making lofty long-term projections, Tronox's forecasting processes fell short as sales continued to decline and costs increased, ultimately, derailing the Company's revenue projections.

On July 30, 2025, Tronox announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, revealing a significant reduction in TiO2 sales for the quarter. The Company attributed the decline to ""softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics."" As a result of the setback in sales, defendants revised the Company's 2025 financial outlook lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%.

Following this news, Tronox's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $5.14 per share on July 30, 2025, Tronox's stock price fell to $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, a decline of about 38% in the span of just a single day.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

The ready-mix concrete industry in the Sunbelt is highly-fragmented, consisting primarily of smaller, privately owned companies, many of which are going through generational transitions. We believe this will benefit Suncrete as we seek to execute on our acquisition strategy and expand our footprint in the Sunbelt. In addition, we are excited to partner with Haymaker. Combining with Haymaker provides a professional, sophisticated and experienced strategic partnership. This partnership has been critical to achieving commitments from institutional investors of $82.5 million in a common stock private placement, which provides considerable runway to execute the Company's growth objectives.""

Suncrete's local market leadership, scale and operational blueprint positions the business as a trusted partner in some of the nation's most attractive and resilient construction markets.""

Randall Edgar, CEO of Suncrete, stated, ""We are pleased to partner with SunTx, and we greatly value their participation in our shared vision. We are also excited to enter the public markets, and we aim for profitable growth to enhance shareholder value. Ready-mix concrete is a logistics business that combines raw materials, mixes them on delivery to the job site and provides materials on time, on spec to the customer. Our primary mission is to serve our customers. We believe we cultivate a competitive advantage in our service to customers by making our people, culture, and safety top priorities. Through this approach, we are able to leverage scale to be a leader in our local markets, improve purchasing power and apply operational best practices across our footprint. Through our team's substantial operational experience in executing a proven and repeatable strategy, one that we have developed over decades, we believe we can continue to gain scale and grow in the highly-fragmented ready-mix concrete industry across the high-growth Sunbelt region of the United States.""

""We are thrilled to partner with Suncrete and its impressive and experienced operational leadership team to scale a leading ready-mix concrete logistics and distribution platform company in the high-growth Sunbelt region of the United States,"" said Andrew R.

NEW YORK,Oct. 9, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Quantum Corporation (""Quantum Corporation"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:QMCO) and reminds investors of theNovember 3, 2025 deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

According to the lawsuit, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Quantum Corporation improperly recognized revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025; (2) Quantum Corporation would therefore need to restate its previously filed financial statements for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

On June 30, 2025, Quantum disclosed that it would be unable to timely file its annual financial report for the fiscal year 2025 as it is ""reviewing its accounting related to certain revenue contracts as well as the application of standalone selling price under applicable accounting standards.""

On this news, Quantum's stock price fell $1.00, or 10.03%, to close at $8.97 per share on June 30, 2025, thereby injuring investors.

Then, on August 8, 2025, Quantum announced that its third quarter 2024 financial statements ""should no longer be relied upon"" due to ""deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the Company's disclosure controls and procedures that constituted material weaknesses."" The Company further disclosed that the affected financial statements would be restated to show a new decrease of approximately $3.9 million in revenue.

On this news, Quantum's stock price fell $0.14, or 1.79%, to close at $7.66 per share on August 11, 2025.

Then, on August 18, 2025, Quantum disclosed that its CEO would be resigning from the role after only five months in the position.

On this news, Quantum's stock price fell $0.61, or 8.2%, to close at $6.83 per share on August 19, 2025, thereby injuring investors further.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Quantum Corporation's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: WPP brands itself as a creative transformation company that provides communications, experience, commerce, and technology services.

TheWPPclass action lawsuitallegesthat defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to WPP's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth while also minimizing risk from seasonality and macroeconomic fluctuations. In truth, according to the complaint, WPP's optimistic reports of its potential to achieve new client bid wins and retain its existing clientele fell short of reality as WPP's media arm was not equipped to compete effectively and had begun to lose market share to its competitors.

TheWPPclass action lawsuit furtherallegesthat on July 9, 2025, WPP published a trading update for the first half of 2025, alerting investors that WPP hadallegedly""seen a deterioration in performance as Q2 has progressed,"" attributing the deterioration to both ""continued macro uncertainty weighing on client spend and weaker net new business than originally anticipated,"" at least in part due to ""some distraction to the business"" as a result of the continued restructuring of WPP Media a.k.a. GroupM. The complaint alsoallegesthat in a same-day press release, WPP further announced that CEO, defendant Mark Read, ""will retire from the Board and as CEO on 31 December 2025."" On this news, the price of WPP stock fell more than 18%, according to the complaint.

THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired WPP common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in theWPPclass action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing theWPPclass action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate theWPPclass action lawsuit. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of theWPPclass action lawsuit.

After trading hours on February 28, 2025, Semler Scientific filed with the SEC its 2024 annual report on Form 10-K. The annual report disclosed that on February 11, 2025, Semler Scientific ""began initial settlement discussions with DOJ [(the United States Department of Justice)], but ceased initial discussions on that date.

NEW YORK,Oct. 9, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against V.F. Corporation (""VFC"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:VFC) and reminds investors of theNovember 12, 2025 deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaintallegesthat the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: the true state of VFC's turnaround plans; notably, that additional significant reset actions would be necessary to return the Vans brand to growth, resulting in significant setbacks to Vans' revenue growth trajectory. These statements caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase and/or acquire VFC's securities at artificially inflated prices.

The truth emerged on May 21, 2025, when VFC reported its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results, highlighting a significant decline in Vans' growth trajectory, which faltered from an 8% loss the quarter before to a 20% loss in the fourth quarter, and noting such decline would continue through the next quarter. The Company attributed its results and below-expectation guidance largely as ""a direct effect of deliberately reduced revenue to eliminate unprofitable or unproductive businesses"" and ""an additional set of deliberate actions"" already in-place but previously unannounced. VFC further noted that, disregarding these deliberate actions, Vans would still have shown a ""high single digit[]"" revenue decline, suggesting growth slowed in comparison to the prior years' sequential improvements irrespective of management's new ""deliberate actions.""

Investors and analysts reacted immediately to VFC's revelation. The price of VFC's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $14.43 per share on May 20, 2025, VFC's stock price fell to $12.15 per share on May 21, 2025, a decline of about 15.8% in the span of just a single day.
