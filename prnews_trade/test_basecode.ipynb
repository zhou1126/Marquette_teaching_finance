(\"Lantheus\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ:LNTH) and certain of its officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants forallegedviolations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Lantheus securities betweenFebruary 26, 2025andAugust 5, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site:bgandg.com/LNTH.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Complaintallegesthat, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Pylarify's competitive position; (2) Lantheus was not equipped to properly assess the pricing and competitive dynamics for Pylarify; (3) the Company failed to disclose that its early 2025 price increase—issued despite prior price erosion—created an opportunity for competitive pricing to flourish, thereby jeopardizing Pylarify's price point, revenue, and overall growth potential; and (4) as a result, Defendants' statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\n",

Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We represent investors in class actions on a contingency fee basis. That means we will ask the court to reimburse us for out-of-pocket expenses and attorneys' fees, usually a percentage of the total recovery, only if we are successful.\n",
