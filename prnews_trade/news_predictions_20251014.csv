FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Following a two-week drydock in Portland, Oregon, Sapphire Princess has set sail unveiling exciting new guest experiences, including the addition of two popular specialty restaurants - Makoto Ocean and Crown Grill. Makoto Ocean and Crown Grill will be open for guests starting November 16, 2025.

The 115,875-ton ship, which carries 2,670 guests, underwent general refurbishments and enhancements, highlighted by the transformation of two venues into specialty dining experiences.

Makoto Ocean Sushi by Chef Makoto OkuwaFollowing its acclaimed debut aboard Sun Princess and Star Princess, Makoto Ocean has been added to Sapphire Princess,in place of the former Internet Café located on Deck 7. The restaurant brings the authentic artistry of Chef Makoto Okuwa's Edomae-style sushi to sea. Guests can enjoy a premium menu of specialties, including truffle salmon, snow crab temaki, and toro tartare, alongside handcrafted cocktails such as the Genmai Negroni (a refined Japanese twist on the classic) and Kodai No Hana (blending yuzu juice with Doburoku, an ancient sake).

Crown Grill SteakhouseAnother highlight of the drydock is the addition of the award-winning Crown Grill, now occupying the former Savoy Dining Room on Deck 5. The Crown Grill is a longtime guest favorite, serving premium aged beef, chops and fresh seafood. With warm, elegant design and attentive service, the restaurant has been recognized as one of the ""Best Cruise Ship Steakhouses at Sea.""

Both dining experiences are priced at $60 per person and included as a specialty dining option for guests who book the Princess Premier package.

Upcoming Itineraries for Sapphire PrincessFresh from her revitalization, Sapphire Princess sets sail to Mexico before repositioning for a season of South America/Antarctica cruises, followed by Mediterranean and Northern Europe voyages in spring and summer 2026. In fall 2026, she will sail a series of Canada/New England cruises.

In a historic first for the cruise line, March 2027 will mark the reunion of sister ships Sapphire Princess and Diamond Princess in Japan. Both ships—built in Japan—will sail from the Tokyo region for Princess Cruises' most expansive Japan season ever, running March through December 2027.

""With the addition of Makoto Ocean and Crown Grill, our guests aboard Sapphire Princess will enjoy two of our most popular dining experiences, elevating the culinary journey across her itineraries,"" said Sami Kohen, Princess Cruises Vice President of Food and Beverage. ""We're especially proud to bring these enhancements as Sapphire Princess prepares for remarkable seasons ahead, including our historic dual-ship deployment in Japan in 2027.""

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) joined the arrival ceremony hosted by the Belgian Air Force at the base to celebrate the F-35's official incorporation into Belgian Air Force operations.

""Together with our NATO and European allies, we're building a wall of F-35s — a shield of over 700 aircraft securing our European skies, said General Frederik Vansina,"" Chief of Defence of the Belgian Armed Forces. ""That wall is not a symbol of aggression, but of determination. It says loud and clear: the skies over Europe belong to those who defend freedom, not to those who seek to destroy it.""

""Together with our NATO and European allies, we're building a wall of F-35s — a shield of over 700 aircraft securing our European skies, said General Frederik Vansina,"" Chief of Defence of the Belgian Armed Forces. ""That wall is not a symbol of aggression, but of determination. It says loud and clear: the skies over Europe belong to those who defend freedom, not to those who seek to destroy it.""

""With the F-35, Belgium is reclaiming its place among the world's leading air forces, equipped with the most advanced technology, integrated within a multinational and interconnected environment,"" said Major General Geert De Decker, Commander of the Belgian Air Force.

""The F-35 is a testament to the power of allied air power, providing a critical advantage to all who operate it. As we've seen in recent operations on Europe's eastern flank, this aircraft is making a difference for the deterrence and defense of NATO,"" said Greg Ulmer, president, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. ""For more than 70 years, we have proudly partnered with Belgium to strengthen its national security and defense industrial base, and this milestone is a major step toward ensuring the Belgian Air Force will continue staying ahead of adversarial threats for decades to come.""

The combat-proven F-35 is the fighter of choice for 20 allied nations – including 13 in Europe – with active operations across 16 services and more than 1,900 global suppliers. By providing stability, interoperability and unmatched value, the program serves as a strong network of integrated deterrence, reinforces partnerships and fuels the allied defense industrial base.

Including the aircraft delivered in country, Belgium has received 11 of its 34 F-35A aircraft. Eight aircraft are stationed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where Belgian pilots and maintainers conduct training. In July, Belgium announced its intent to procure 11 additional F-35As, which would bring the total program of record to 45 aircraft.

About the F-35 Lightning IIMore than 1,245 F-35s are currently operational around the globe, and the fleet has surpassed 1 million flight hours. The combat-proven F-35 operates from 50 bases worldwide, including 10 nations operating on home soil. As adversaries advance and legacy aircraft age, the F-35 is critical to maintaining air dominance for decades to come.

(Nasdaq:ATXG) (the ""Company"", ""ATXG"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") today announced that it is in discussions with KINGS UNITED HOLDING LIMITED (""KINGS"") regarding a potential strategic cooperation focused on integrating the Web3.0 payment infrastructure and Real-World Asset (""RWA"") enablement within ATXG's supply-chain and settlement ecosystem. The discussions are intended to assess how blockchain-native payment systems and tokenized settlement technologies could complement ATXG's digital transformation objectives and operational scalability.

The parties are evaluating a structured proposal that could involve the establishment of a Hong Kong-licensed trust vehicle and the potential transfer of up to 100,000,000 KINGS native tokens (representing an indicative 1% allocation) at a notional valuation of approximately USD 10 million, with potential consideration including issuance of common shares to the trust entity. KINGS, a BVI-incorporated holding group, wholly owns ALL INFintechLimited (Kings UnitedFintechLimited), a New York-registered entity holding FinCEN MSB Registration No. 31000289207014. The group develops multi-chain prepaid card systems, distributed credit frameworks, and global acquiring networks designed to bridge Web2.0 and Web3.0 payment environments.

Management believes that a collaboration of this nature could enhance ATXG's capabilities in piloting tokenized settlement and RWA-based infrastructure, improve transparency across international payment flows, and open additional digital monetization channels consistent with its governance and compliance framework.

""We are reviewing opportunities where blockchain infrastructure can tangibly strengthen our supply-chain operations and international payment architecture,"" said Mr. Hong Zhida, Chief Executive Officer.

Management intends to further advance ATXG's strategic positioning indigital assetinfrastructure through potential collaborations that align with its long-term growth roadmap and innovation priorities. ATXG continues to evaluate strategic alternatives and will take such actions as may be appropriate to preserve shareholder value and address the operational and regulatory considerations relevant to any future execution.

(Nasdaq:ATXG) (the ""Company"", ""ATXG"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") today announced that it is in discussions with KINGS UNITED HOLDING LIMITED (""KINGS"") regarding a potential strategic cooperation focused on integrating the Web3.0 payment infrastructure and Real-World Asset (""RWA"") enablement within ATXG's supply-chain and settlement ecosystem. The discussions are intended to assess how blockchain-native payment systems and tokenized settlement technologies could complement ATXG's digital transformation objectives and operational scalability.

The parties are evaluating a structured proposal that could involve the establishment of a Hong Kong-licensed trust vehicle and the potential transfer of up to 100,000,000 KINGS native tokens (representing an indicative 1% allocation) at a notional valuation of approximately USD 10 million, with potential consideration including issuance of common shares to the trust entity. KINGS, a BVI-incorporated holding group, wholly owns ALL INFintechLimited (Kings UnitedFintechLimited), a New York-registered entity holding FinCEN MSB Registration No. 31000289207014. The group develops multi-chain prepaid card systems, distributed credit frameworks, and global acquiring networks designed to bridge Web2.0 and Web3.0 payment environments.

Management believes that a collaboration of this nature could enhance ATXG's capabilities in piloting tokenized settlement and RWA-based infrastructure, improve transparency across international payment flows, and open additional digital monetization channels consistent with its governance and compliance framework.

""We are reviewing opportunities where blockchain infrastructure can tangibly strengthen our supply-chain operations and international payment architecture,"" said Mr. Hong Zhida, Chief Executive Officer.

Management intends to further advance ATXG's strategic positioning indigital assetinfrastructure through potential collaborations that align with its long-term growth roadmap and innovation priorities. ATXG continues to evaluate strategic alternatives and will take such actions as may be appropriate to preserve shareholder value and address the operational and regulatory considerations relevant to any future execution.

183,2025-10-14,09:12 ET,ERShares' XOVR ETF Opens the Door to Pre-IPO Stage InvestingERShares' Private-Public Crossover ETF (XOVR) has become the first ETF to provide investors exposure at the IPO stage. This milestone - historically...,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ershares-xovr-etf-opens-the-door-to-pre-ipo-stage-investing-302583501.html,"NEW YORK,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- ERShares' Private-Public Crossover ETF (XOVR) has become the first ETF to provide investors exposure at the IPO stage. This milestone - historically reserved for venture capital, insiders, and institutions - was illustrated with Klarna's recent IPO.

XOVR was relaunched on August 30, 2024, when ERShares combined its proprietary Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) with selective private equity exposure, building a structure designed to capture growth opportunities across both the public and private markets.

Traditionally, ETFs only gave investors access to companies after they became public. By incorporating Klarna shares ahead of its IPO, XOVR demonstrated that exposure to the private-to-public transition can be delivered within a regulated, liquid framework.

Eva Ados, COO and Chief Investment Strategist at ERShares:

""It's time retail investors finally get a seat at the IPO table. For too long, this dynamic stage of growth has been reserved for institutions and insiders only. With Klarna, XOVR demonstrated that the gap can be narrowed - offering everyday investors exposure at the same point insiders participate. Markets are at a turning point, and we believe the opportunity to expand private equity exposure has never been more compelling.""

""XOVR is not just another ETF - it's a breakthrough. We anchor in the ER30TR Index to capture leading-edge public innovators, while our private equity allocation is designed to extend access to opportunities that retail investors have historically been shut out of.""

""Much of today's wealth creation occurs before the opening bell ever rings. We believe XOVR helps break down that barrier and opens the door for everyday investors to participate in growth across the full cycle - private and public - all in one ETF, with daily liquidity.""

Since its relaunch on August 30, 2024, when ERShares combined the ER30TR Index with selective private equity exposure, XOVR has delivered a total return of +37.2% (with dividends reinvested)*. Over the same period:

Source: ERShares, Bloomberg. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Indices are unmanaged, not investable, and included for illustrative purposes only.

For decades, much of the wealth creation in leading companies has taken place in private markets before IPO. As companies remain private longer, retail investors have been locked out of their most dynamic growth phases. XOVR's approach seeks to bridge this gap, connecting investors to innovation across multiple stages of growth.

Current holdings include both public and private companies such as SpaceX, Anduril, and Klarna. These are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent buy or sell recommendations. (Holdings are subject to change). Management believes that additional opportunities may arise in late 2025 as more private companies approach public markets.

ERShares focuses on global investment strategies driven by entrepreneurship and innovation. XOVR is the first ETF designed to include a measured allocation to private equity exposure while maintaining the liquidity, transparency, and regulatory oversight of an ETF.

NEW YORK and STOCKHOLM,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Dashlane, a credential security leader, and Yubico, a modern cybersecurity company and creator of the most secure passkeys, have partnered to launch phishing-resistant, passwordless login to Dashlane, offering the strongest passkey protection for vault login and encryption without the need for a master password. By integrating Yubico's signature product, the YubiKey, with Dashlane's passwordless login, new personal users are empowered with strong, hardware-backed authentication and the ability to access their vault, all with the simple touch of a YubiKey. Users can also register multiple keys to ensure they maintain access if their primary YubiKey is lost or damaged and set up additional devices without typing a single password.

""Achieving a phishing-resistant, passwordless future is dependent on whether our industry can make security and passkey authentication accessible and easy to use for everyone,"" said Sheryl Chamberlain, senior vice president, business development, Yubico. ""Both Yubico and Dashlane have a deep history of security innovation in service of making the internet more secure, and are at the forefront of reaching the next horizon using passkeys for both authentication and encryption. As society faces evolving threats like AI-driven phishing attacks, it's more important than ever to streamline access to device-bound passkeys that address the biggest threat today in stolen login credentials.""

""Achieving a phishing-resistant, passwordless future is dependent on whether our industry can make security and passkey authentication accessible and easy to use for everyone,"" said Sheryl Chamberlain, senior vice president, business development, Yubico. ""Both Yubico and Dashlane have a deep history of security innovation in service of making the internet more secure, and are at the forefront of reaching the next horizon using passkeys for both authentication and encryption. As society faces evolving threats like AI-driven phishing attacks, it's more important than ever to streamline access to device-bound passkeys that address the biggest threat today in stolen login credentials.""

With the release, Dashlane is the first major credential manager to adopt FIDO2 security keys as the primary method for vault access, an advancement made possible by leveraging the WebAuthn PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension. Instead of using the security key as an authentication factor, the WebAuthn PRF extension enables the YubiKey to both authenticate the user and unlock the vault. This is achieved by securely generating a strong, cryptographically unique-secret intrinsically bound to the passkey, which is then used as a critical input to the key derivation function that generates the final vault encryption/decryption key. This powerful mechanism facilitates a seamless, phishing-resistant, and entirely passwordless flow that dramatically enhances usability, security and user privacy.

""The password is a fundamentally flawed security control that still lies at the root of most of the breaches that occur today,"" said John Bennett, chief executive officer, Dashlane. ""The Dashlane and Yubico integration combines the most advanced security available to protect sensitive credentials while eliminating the friction often caused by password-based logins, drastically raising costs for attackers and making good security hygiene easy for users.""

A framework for cross-platform security key support

Currently available using the browser extension, passwordless login with YubiKeys is the first critical step towards establishing a cross-platform, phishing-resistant framework that scales to protect Dashlane users and enterprise customers on all platforms.

Security key-based encryption/decryption using WebAuthn PRF is currently unavailable on mobile devices as the relevant OS APIs are not available on all mobile operating systems or on non-Chromium browsers. As part of Dashlane and Yubico's partnership, development of a Yubico SDK is underway to extend security key PRF support from web to mobile, providing seamless security across platforms.

""Dashlane and Yubico are leading the push towards a broader, passwordless vision where credential vaults are completely phishing resistant across all platforms, whether you're using Dashlane personally or at work,"" said Bennett.

As credential theft continues to be at the heart of the majority of breaches, Dashlane's partnership with Yubico is another milestone in its journey towards a passwordless future:

Yubico has pioneered enterprise hardware-based security keys since 2007, championing open authentication standards and delivering modern, device-bound passkey authentication securityat scale. YubiKeys support multiple phishing-resistant authentication protocols such as FIDO2/WebAuthn, U2F, and Smart Card (PIV) – providing a seamless pathway to passwordless authentication for enterprises of any size. Withsupportfor hundreds of applications and services, YubiKeys deliver seamless operation across all operating systems and mobile devices. This form of modern MFA empowers enterprises to take advantage of passwordless environments across their many applications, teams and business processes – and can be seamlessly rolled out globally to employees throughYubiKey as a Service.

Passwordless login with YubiKeys is currently in beta for new Dashlane personal users, with support for existing personal users and business customers to follow.

SOUTHLAKE, Texas,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR), a leading software and technology provider powering the global travel industry, today announced the launch of SabreMosaic™ Continuous Revenue Optimizer (CRO), an industry-first AI-driven modular solution that enables airlines to move beyond traditional fare classes and deliver continuous pricing recommendations for each shopping request.

Built in partnership with Riyadh Air, CRO expands on the momentum of SabreMosaic, the modular, AI-native platform introduced last year that has already delivered more than 16 new products for over 10 airline customers, generating tens of millions of dollars in estimated incremental revenue to its airline users. The new solution combines Sabre's proprietary data and algorithms with Sabre's AI capabilities to continuously determine the optimal price for every seat per customer segment.

By analyzing real-time demand, booking patterns and competitive market conditions, CRO enables airlines to present each passenger with the most relevant and competitive fare for their journey. This helps travelers find offers that best match their preferences, while allowing airlines to adjust pricing—sometimes downward—to absorb additional demand and thereby increase total revenue. In doing so, airlines can achieve up to a 3.5% uplift in overall revenue without adding capacity.

CRO is powered by Sabre IQ, Sabre's systemic AI layer combining proprietary algorithms with the scale of its Travel Data Cloud. With over 50 petabytes of aggregated, anonymized travel intelligence, this foundation gives Sabre the richest base of travel industry knowledge anywhere. Sabre's data and AI infrastructure enables smarter pricing, retailing, and servicing at scale. CRO exemplifies how Sabre applies this capability to deliver measurable airline results today.

""The next paradigm shift in revenue optimization is here,"" said Mike Reyes, Senior Vice President, Product Management at Sabre. ""We are thrilled to be making this technical leap forward with Riyadh Air, a likeminded partner who has gone on the journey with us to reimagine what the future of revenue optimization can look like.""

Reyes explains, ""Continuous Revenue Optimizer applies the science of real-time pricing to airline retailing in a way that helps airlines meet customer and business objectives while moving to a fully modern offer and order-based environment. What excites me most about our approach is that we've used Sabre IQ to help the next generation of airline analysts embrace this new technology easier than ever before, helping our airlines deliver faster, measurable revenue gains.""

Through this partnership with Sabre, and as the industry's first airline to employ this revolutionary solution, Riyadh Air is fine-tuning its pricing science to maximize revenue opportunities while navigating a hybrid environment where most partners still operate with fare rules.

""We have a bold vision to reimagine the entire traveler experience,"" said Shihaj Kutty, VP Pricing and Revenue Management at Riyadh Air. ""With a digitally-savvy population to serve, we knew we needed cutting-edge technology to understand our customers in new ways, so that we could present relevant and optimized offers at the time of search and shop. Sabre's legacy of expertise in this area, paired with their innovative approach to solving this problem, gave us confidence that Sabre was the right partner.

When evaluating technology to meet this need, what set CRO apart was its approach to segment-based continuous pricing, allowing us to balance commercial performance with traveler value – all while supporting the long-term growth of our business,"" said Kutty.

The introduction of CRO comes at a time when airlines are under increasing pressure to optimize every seat sold. A study from MIT1found that airlines implementing segmented continuous pricing—especially classless models—can achieve revenue gains of 3% to 6% in realistic competitive scenarios. By enabling continuous, classless pricing, CRO addresses a long‑standing limitation of legacy revenue management systems and positions airlines to compete more effectively in markets where demand patterns shift rapidly.

CRO was previewed during Sabre's keynote session at the recent T2RL Engage conference, where executives from Riyadh Air joined Sabre leaders on stage to share their firsthand experiences. Their joint presence underscored the industry momentum behind classless revenue management and the accelerating adoption of next generation offer and order capabilities.

Following the announcement at T2RL Engage, CRO is available for any airline to purchase as a standalone module, or in conjunction with the SabreMosaic platform.

STAMFORD, Conn. and NEW YORK,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Synchrony(NYSE:SYF), a leading consumer financing company, today announced a new partnership with Pumpkin Pet Insurance, to bring its pet health reimbursement solution to even more pet parents. This collaboration provides pet owners with a convenient and simplified way to manage veterinary care costs.

With this offering, Pumpkin Pet Insurance policyholders can utilize their CareCredit credit card to pay for veterinary services upfront at locations in the CareCredit network and select their card to receive payment for their submitted claim. Once their claim is processed and approved by Pumpkin Pet Insurance, the eligible reimbursement is then directly applied to their CareCredit account. This streamlined process eliminates the need to wait for a check from Pumpkin, providing access to funds and reducing the financial stress of paying for veterinary care.

SEOUL, South Korea,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Lunit (KRX:328130.KQ), a leading provider of AI for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, today announced the presentation of three studies at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025, taking place October 17–21 in Berlin, Germany. All three studies highlight how Lunit's AI pathology solution, Lunit SCOPE IO®, can identify biomarkers that predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), offering new potential to guide more effective and personalized cancer treatment.

Among these, the first study, selected for oral presentation, was conducted in collaboration with Chiara Cremolini, MD, PhD, Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Pisa, Italy. Researchers applied Lunit SCOPE IO to pre-treatment H&E slides from patients with proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) enrolled in the AtezoTRIBE and AVETRIC trials. The AI quantified multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment, generating a biomarker that stratified patients into ""biomarker-high"" and ""biomarker-low"" groups.

In the AtezoTRIBE trial, biomarker-high patients treated with atezolizumab plus FOLFOXIRI/bevacizumab showed significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to biomarker-low patients, while no such benefit was observed in the control arm. Validation in the AVETRIC cohort confirmed improved survival outcomes for biomarker-high patients receiving ICI-based therapy, with better PFS and OS compared to biomarker-low patients. These results suggest that an AI-derived tumor microenvironment biomarker could help identify patients with pMMR mCRC who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy combinations—an urgent unmet need in this population.

A collaborative study with Yonsei University College of Medicine, Korea, evaluated whether AI-defined immune phenotypes (IP) could predict outcomes in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) treated with either nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO+IPI) or sunitinib (SUN). Using Lunit SCOPE IO, tumors were classified as inflamed or non-inflamed, based on the density and spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Patients with inflamed tumors treated with NIVO+IPI demonstrated significantly longer PFS, OS, and higher response rates (60.5% vs. 23.2%) compared to those with non-inflamed tumors. No such benefit was observed in the SUN arm. Findings were validated in an independent ccRCC cohort and aligned with inflamed gene expression signatures from The Cancer Genome Atlas, supporting AI-based immune phenotyping as a promising biomarker to guide treatment selection between immunotherapy combinations and targeted therapies in first-line treatment for ccRCC.

The third study, conducted in collaboration with the National Cancer Center Hospital East (NCCHE) Japan, further validated the predictive power of Lunit SCOPE IO for ICI treatment response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this multicenter prospective study, tumors classified as inflamed showed significantly better responses and longer survival with ICI therapy compared to non-inflamed tumors, a difference not observed among patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. This result strengthens the evidence supporting Lunit SCOPE IO as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy benefit in NSCLC.

""At ESMO 2025, we are demonstrating how AI can unlock predictive biomarkers directly from routine pathology slides,"" said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. ""These findings show the potential of Lunit SCOPE IO to help identify patients who will truly benefit from immunotherapy—whether in colorectal or kidney cancer—and to guide treatment strategies that can make cancer care more precise and effective.""

(Nasdaq:ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today announced the launch of ADI Power Studio, a comprehensive family of products that offers advanced modeling, component recommendations and efficiency analysis with simulation. In addition, ADI is introducing early versions of two new web-based tools with a modernized user experience under the Power Studio umbrella: ADI Power StudioPlannerand ADI Power StudioDesigner. These new tools, together with the full ADI Power Studio portfolio, including LTspice®, SIMPLIS®, LTpowerCAD®, LTpowerPlanner®, EE-Sim®, LTpowerPlay® and LTpowerAnalyzer™, streamline the entire power system design process. The Power Studio tools support engineers from initial concept through measurement and evaluation, empowering engineers to design with confidence and efficiency.

Today's electronic systems require more power density than ever, with dozens or even hundreds of power rails and interdependent voltage domains. That complexity creates bottlenecks and requires rework during architecture decisions, component selection and validation. Power Studio addresses these challenges by providing a unified, intuitive workflow that helps engineering teams make better decisions earlier by simulating real-world performance with accurate models and automating key outputs, such as bill of materials and report generation. Together, the family of tools can facilitate shorter development cycles, reduce rework and increase speed at which engineers bring power-dense systems to market.

""ADI Power Studio is more than a set of tools — it's a design ecosystem,"" said Robert Reay, Vice President and Fellow, Power Products, ADI. ""By integrating new system-level and IC-level design capabilities into a single product family, we're enabling engineers to streamline power management design and optimization so they have the potential to get solutions to their customers faster.""

ADI remains committed to supporting its portfolio of existing desktop and web-based power management tools, including  LTspice, SIMPLIS, LTpowerCAD, LTpowerPlanner, EE-Sim, LTpowerPlay and LTpowerAnalyzer, to ensure customer continuity.

Power StudioPlannerand Power StudioDesignerare available now as part of the ADI Power Studio. These tools represent the first phase of ADI's vision to deliver a fully connected power design workflow for customers, with ongoing updates and product announcements planned in the months ahead.

These new tools, together with the full ADI Power Studio portfolio, including LTspice®, SIMPLIS®, LTpowerCAD®, LTpowerPlanner®, EE-Sim®, LTpowerPlay® and LTpowerAnalyzer™, streamline the entire power system design process. The Power Studio tools support engineers from initial concept through measurement and evaluation, empowering engineers to design with confidence and efficiency.

Today's electronic systems require more power density than ever, with dozens or even hundreds of power rails and interdependent voltage domains. That complexity creates bottlenecks and requires rework during architecture decisions, component selection and validation. Power Studio addresses these challenges by providing a unified, intuitive workflow that helps engineering teams make better decisions earlier by simulating real-world performance with accurate models and automating key outputs, such as bill of materials and report generation. Together, the family of tools can facilitate shorter development cycles, reduce rework and increase speed at which engineers bring power-dense systems to market.

""ADI Power Studio is more than a set of tools — it's a design ecosystem,"" said Robert Reay, Vice President and Fellow, Power Products, ADI. ""By integrating new system-level and IC-level design capabilities into a single product family, we're enabling engineers to streamline power management design and optimization so they have the potential to get solutions to their customers faster.""

ADI remains committed to supporting its portfolio of existing desktop and web-based power management tools, including  LTspice, SIMPLIS, LTpowerCAD, LTpowerPlanner, EE-Sim, LTpowerPlay and LTpowerAnalyzer, to ensure customer continuity.

Power StudioPlannerand Power StudioDesignerare available now as part of the ADI Power Studio. These tools represent the first phase of ADI's vision to deliver a fully connected power design workflow for customers, with ongoing updates and product announcements planned in the months ahead.

""TrueFrame allows contractors to spend less time culling boards and planing down joists on the jobsite and more time building,"" said Grace Bilbrough, Director of Marketing at ProWood. ""It's lighter than LVL or steel and built for dependable performance in substructure, the foundation to many outdoor projects.""

Available in 2x8, 2x10, and 2x12 in lengths of 12, 14, 16, and 20 feet, TrueFrame Joists deliver optimal spans and consistent sizing for dependable framing that exceeds expectations. Under wet-use conditions (40 PSF live load + 10 PSF dead load, L/360), TrueFrame spans up to 20 7"" for 2x12 at 12"" OC, outperforming typical framing materials while reducing callbacks and jobsite headaches.

TrueFrame Joists feature ProWood's new enhanced preservation treatment with proprietary additives, ensuring less checking, greater stability, and straighter boards. Treated to meet UC4A Ground Contact standards, TrueFrame delivers unmatched durability in substructure applications, while color infusion ensures lasting beauty for projects demanding visible framing. Each joist is factory-planed within 1/16"" for flat edges and uniform sizing, ensuring a straight, stable installation that saves time, reduces waste, and delivers exceptional end results.

""What sets ProWood TrueFrame apart is the precision. With KDAT and pre-planed boards, the joists install cleanly and consistently, cutting days off the framing process,"" says pro builder Jonathan Moeller of Colorado Custom Covers & Decks. ""It's engineered for efficiency and gives me confidence the frame will stay true and stable over time.""

Additionally, this new product is covered by ProWood's Limited Lifetime Warranty, providing builders and their clients with peace of mind and confidence in the framing that supports every deck, porch, or outdoor living space.

The TrueFrame Joist is now available through ProWood dealers in the Denver Metro area and is coming to new markets throughout the Great Lakes and Northeastern regions in early 2026. For span charts, technical details, and dealer locations, visithttps://www.prowood.com/c/trueframe-joist.

Investor Deadline:Investors who purchased or acquiredFLRsecurities during the Class Period may, no later thanNovember 14, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights,CLICK HERE.

FLR, headquartered in Irving, Texas, provides engineering, procurement, and construction, as well as project management services worldwide. Its Urban Solutions segment is the largest revenue driver of three segments.

According to the lawsuit, FLR isallegedto have concealed significant cost overruns and execution problems on key infrastructure projects, including the Gordie Howe International Bridge, I-635/LBJ, and I-35. These projects—central to the Company's Urban Solutions segment—saw cost increases due to subcontractor errors, supply chain inflation, and construction delays. At the same time, the Companyallegedlyoverstated the strength of its risk mitigation strategy while failing to disclose the full impact of reduced client spending and macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite these mounting issues, FLR reaffirmed its financial guidance in May 2025. On August 1, 2025, the Company reported second-quarter results that sharply missed expectations, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 (missing by $0.13) and revenue of $3.98 billion (missing by $570 million). FLR cut its full-year guidance to reflect these challenges. Following these disclosures, the Company's stock fell27.04%to a closing price of $41.42 on August 1, 2025. Following the news, analysts downgraded the stock, citing lost confidence in management's disclosures and project oversight.

FLR, headquartered in Irving, Texas, provides engineering, procurement, and construction, as well as project management services worldwide. Its Urban Solutions segment is the largest revenue driver of three segments.

According to the lawsuit, FLR isallegedto have concealed significant cost overruns and execution problems on key infrastructure projects, including the Gordie Howe International Bridge, I-635/LBJ, and I-35. These projects—central to the Company's Urban Solutions segment—saw cost increases due to subcontractor errors, supply chain inflation, and construction delays. At the same time, the Companyallegedlyoverstated the strength of its risk mitigation strategy while failing to disclose the full impact of reduced client spending and macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite these mounting issues, FLR reaffirmed its financial guidance in May 2025. On August 1, 2025, the Company reported second-quarter results that sharply missed expectations, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 (missing by $0.13) and revenue of $3.98 billion (missing by $570 million). FLR cut its full-year guidance to reflect these challenges. Following these disclosures, the Company's stock fell27.04%to a closing price of $41.42 on August 1, 2025. Following the news, analysts downgraded the stock, citing lost confidence in management's disclosures and project oversight.

This milestone marks TOYO's commencement of full commercial operations at the Houston Facility, reinforcing TOYO's commitment to expanding its U.S.-based manufacturing footprint.

The Houston Facility is designed to produce up to 1 GW of high-efficiency solar modules annually. During the trial production phase, the Company has received strong demand from its U.S. clients for the modules manufactured at the Houston Facility. As operations scale, TOYO anticipates robust demand from utility-scale developers seeking reliable and domestically manufactured modules that qualify for favorable tax incentives.

""This certification is a major step forward in our 'made-in-USA-for-the-USA' strategy,"" said Junsei Ryu, Chairman and CEO of TOYO. ""We're proud to bring high-quality solar module production to Texas and to support our partners with dependable U.S.-based supply. The strong momentum in customer orders reflects our partners' trust in TOYO's technology, execution and long-term commitment to the U.S. market.""

The Houston Facility is expected to qualify for tax incentives under Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, providing up to $0.07 per watt in production credits through 2030. This strengthens TOYO's cost competitiveness while supporting broader goals for domestic energy manufacturing.

TOYO is a solar solutions company committed to becoming a full-service solar solutions provider in the global market, integrating upstream production of wafers and silicon, midstream production of solar cells, downstream production of photovoltaic modules, and potentially other stages of the solar power supply chain. TOYO is well-positioned to produce high-quality solar cells at a competitive scale and cost.

(NASDAQ:BDMD) (""BAIRD MEDICAL"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in minimally invasive Microwave Ablation (MWA) technology, highlighted the significant findings of a cost-utility analysis conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The study abstract, presented at the recent American Thyroid Association (ATA) Annual Meeting, concludes that management strategies incorporating transcutaneous thyroid nodule ablation (TNA) can lead to lower healthcare costs and improved patient quality of life.

The independent research, ""Cost-Utility Analysis of Management Strategies Incorporating Transcutaneous Thyroid Nodule Ablation for Benign and Malignant Thyroid Nodules,"" developed a health economic model to compare TNA with traditional approaches such as surgery and observation. The model revealed that incorporating TNA into treatment plans resulted in projected per-patient cost savings of $1,641 for benign nodules and $380 for thyroid microcarcinomas over a five-year horizon, while also yielding gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

The study's analysis suggests that TNA is the preferred management strategy from a health economic perspective in a significant majority of scenarios. These findings provide valuable, data-driven insights that can help inform the decisions of clinicians, payors, and patients regarding the management of thyroid nodules.

Baird Medical supported this study as part of its ongoing commitment to advancing evidence-based innovation in interventional medicine. The Company will continue to evaluate the research findings for their potential to inform future developments in patient care.

Baird Medical is a forward-thinking medical device company specializing in minimally invasive diagnostics and treatment. It is dedicated to the research and development of surgical robotic systems and innovative minimally invasive surgical instruments. Our mission is to enhance patient outcomes through precision technology and advanced diagnostic solutions. The company will foster strategic collaborations with leading academic institutions. Our vision extends beyond surgical assistance, aiming to develop intelligent systems that proactively guide diagnostic decisions and preventive healthcare strategies. As an FDA 510(k)-certified medical device company, Baird Medical's solutions have been used in over 30 prestigious hospitals and clinics across the United States, including Johns Hopkins Hospital, Tulane Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Columbia University Medical Center.

(NASDAQ:BDMD) (""BAIRD MEDICAL"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in minimally invasive Microwave Ablation (MWA) technology, highlighted the significant findings of a cost-utility analysis conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The study abstract, presented at the recent American Thyroid Association (ATA) Annual Meeting, concludes that management strategies incorporating transcutaneous thyroid nodule ablation (TNA) can lead to lower healthcare costs and improved patient quality of life.

The independent research, ""Cost-Utility Analysis of Management Strategies Incorporating Transcutaneous Thyroid Nodule Ablation for Benign and Malignant Thyroid Nodules,"" developed a health economic model to compare TNA with traditional approaches such as surgery and observation. The model revealed that incorporating TNA into treatment plans resulted in projected per-patient cost savings of $1,641 for benign nodules and $380 for thyroid microcarcinomas over a five-year horizon, while also yielding gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

The study's analysis suggests that TNA is the preferred management strategy from a health economic perspective in a significant majority of scenarios. These findings provide valuable, data-driven insights that can help inform the decisions of clinicians, payors, and patients regarding the management of thyroid nodules.

Baird Medical supported this study as part of its ongoing commitment to advancing evidence-based innovation in interventional medicine. The Company will continue to evaluate the research findings for their potential to inform future developments in patient care.

(NASDAQ:OSRH) today announced that it has executed a definitive agreement to acquire Woori IO Co., Ltd. (""WORIO""), a pioneer in noninvasive glucose monitoring (NIGM), via a comprehensive share exchange. The acquisition reinforces OSRH's dedication to advancing biomedical innovation by adding a potential breakthrough technology for diabetes care, bringing truly needle-free glucose monitoring closer to patients globally and promising a safer, more convenient and accurate alternative to currently available technologies.

Through this acquisition, OSRH aims to strengthen its medical-device platform, diversify its healthcare portfolio, and capture recurring revenue from the global glucose-monitoring market. Strategic highlights of the WORIO acquisition include:

Under the definitive agreement, WORIO will become a wholly owned subsidiary of OSRH's Korean affiliate, OSR Holdings Co., Ltd. (""OSRK""). WORIO shareholders will receive newly issued OSRK shares worth KRW15bn (~$10.5 million) in exchange for WORIO shares. If, within 3 years of the share exchange, OSRH reaches at least $10 per share, OSRK shares may be converted into OSRH common stock at a ratio of 12.96:1 or approximately 1.09 million new shares.

""The acquisition of Woori IO delivers significant upside for OSRH shareholders,"" said Peter Hwang, CEO of OSRH. ""Acquired at a valuation of less than $11 million, Woori IO is an undervalued opportunity compared with multi-billion-dollar continuous glucose monitor (CGM) peers like Dexcom. We believe WORIO brings a recognized, high-growth noninvasive glucose-monitoring platform into the OSRH ecosystem. Importantly, there is no immediate dilution for OSRH shareholders, allowing them to participate in the potential upside from a disruptive technology well-positioned to enter the fast-growing global glucose-monitoring market while preserving existing ownership stakes.""

""We're thrilled to become an OSR Company, a major milestone for Woori IO"" said Sunkie Park, CEO of WORIO. ""We have full confidence in OSR Holdings' global expertise to not only help us develop and scale our needle-free glucose monitoring solution for diabetes care but also explore additional use cases and broader digital health initiatives, maximizing the impact of our proprietary NIRS-based technology for patients and healthcare providers worldwide.""

WORIO has partnered with a major global consumer electronics company to advance the clinical development of its noninvasive glucose-monitoring devices. The collaboration included non-dilutive funding and participation of the partner's employees in initial proof-of-concept trials. WORIO's regulatory strategy includes launching its clinical trials in Korea at a leading medical center in Seoul, utilizing the center's deep domain expertise to advance studies and generate data that can potentially support approvals for medical devices regionally.

Following the acquisition, WORIO will leverage OSRH's governance, global partnerships and clinical development resources to accelerate product development, enhance supply readiness, and boost commercialization speed and efficiency. ""This technology could redefine glucose monitoring for millions living with diabetes,"" said Dr. Constance Höfer, CSO of OSRH. ""By enabling continuous, truly needle-free data collection, it also supports deeper research into metabolic health, cancer recurrence, exercise physiology, and human performance.""

This press release includes forward-looking statements regarding the expected benefits, synergies, timing, and operations related to this acquisition. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, including regulatory approvals, market conditions, integration execution, and other transaction-related contingencies.

SAN FRANCISCO,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- A federal class-action lawsuit has been filed against aTyr Pharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:ATYR)following a devastating 83% drop in the biotech company's stock price after its lead drug candidate failed to meet its primary endpoint in a critical Phase 3 trial.

Prominent shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman has been investigating theallegedclaims.

The firm urges investors in aTyr who suffered significant losses tosubmit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

Class Period: Jan. 16, 2025 – Sep. 12, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Dec. 8, 2025Visit:www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/atyrContact the Firm Now:[email protected]844-916-0895

The suit,Munguia v. aTyr Pharma Inc., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California,allegesthat aTyr and its top executives made false and misleading statements about the efficacy of its drug, Efzofitimod, leading investors to purchase stock at artificially inflated prices.

The proposed class covers all investors who acquired aTyr common stock between January 16, 2025, and September 12, 2025, inclusive.

At the heart of the allegations is aTyr's Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, known as EFZO-FIT, which evaluated intravenous Efzofitimod in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The drug was intended to help patients reduce their dependency on steroids.

According to the complaint, throughout the Class Period, aTyr executives expressed overwhelmingly positive statements and confidence in the study's design, particularly its forced taper approach intended to gauge the drug's ability to allow patients to completely wean themselves off steroids.

However, the lawsuit claims that concurrently with these optimistic pronouncements, the company wasallegedlyconcealing material adverse facts concerning Efzofitimod's capability to allow a patient to completely taper their steroid usage—a key measure of efficacy.  The lawsuit asserts that aTyr's statements crossed the line into securities law violations byallegedlymisrepresenting the drug's true prospects.

The truth, asallegedin the complaint, came to light on Monday, September 15, 2025. Pre-market, aTyr hosted an investor call announcing that the EFZO-FIT study did not meet its primary endpoint: the change from baseline in mean daily oral corticosteroid (OSC) dose at week 48.

The disappointing topline results prompted a swift and brutal market reaction. aTyr's common stock, which had closed at $6.03 per share on the preceding Friday, September 12, cratered to close at just $1.02 per share on September 15—a catastrophic one-day decline of 83.2%.

In its post-announcement comments, the company stated that it would engage with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine a path forward, acknowledging the setback.

Hagens Berman is investigating whether aTyr may have misled investors about its data and trial design while emphasizing Efzofitimod's multi-billion-dollar market opportunity.  ""We're scrutinizing whether aTyr's previous representations about the drug's efficacy were materially misleading to investors,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the firm's investigation.

Enables customers to achieve breakthrough insights, innovations, and productivity across multicloud and on-premises environments

New Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse supports the Apache Iceberg open table format, enabling customers to use the power of Oracle AI Database for their data lake data

LAS VEGAS,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Oracle AI World-- Oracle AI Database 26ai architects AI into the core of data management, furthering Oracle's commitment to help customers securely bring AI to all their data, everywhere. This milestone advances Oracle's ""AI for Data"" vision of a next-generation AI-native database with use of AI across the entire data and development stack, including AI Vector Search, AI for Database Management, AI for Data Development, AI for Application Development, and AI for Analytics. Customers can now run dynamic agentic AI workflows to provide sophisticated answers and actions that combine private database data with public information.

""By architecting AI and data together, Oracle AI Database makes 'AI for Data' simple to learn and simple to use,"" said Juan Loaiza, executive vice president, Oracle Database Technologies, Oracle. ""We enable our customers to easily deliver trusted AI insights, innovations, and productivity for all their data, everywhere, including both operational systems and analytic data lakes.""

Oracle's ""AI for Data"" strategy is open and ubiquitous. Oracle AI Database's built-in AI capabilities provide customers wide freedom of choice when building and deploying AI applications including support for: the Apache Iceberg open table format; Model Context Protocol (MCP); industry-leading LLMs; popular agentic AI frameworks; and Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) embedding models. Oracle AI Database's mission-critical functionality brings AI to data securely, efficiently, and reliably wherever it resides—Oracle Cloud, leading hyperscale clouds, private cloud, or on-premises.

Oracle AI Database implements NIST-approved quantum-resistant algorithms (ML-KEM) to encrypt data-in-flight. Combined with the existing support for quantum-resistant encryption for data-at-rest, Oracle AI Database's data protection approach is designed to prevent hackers from harvesting organizational data now and decrypting it using quantum computers later. Other vendors have implemented quantum-resistant algorithms either in their network and storage architectures or in their database services, but not both.

""Great AI needs great data. With Oracle AI Database 26ai, customers get both. It's the single place where their business data lives—current, consistent, and secure. And it's the best place to use AI on that data without moving it,"" said Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst, Constellation Research. ""To help simplify and accelerate AI adoption, AI Database 26ai includes impressive new AI features that go beyond AI Vector Search. A highlight is Oracle's architecting Agentic AI into the database, enabling customers to build, deploy, and manage their own in-database AI agents using a no-code visual platform that includes pre-built agents. As Oracle's converged database leadership in transaction processing goes unchallenged, its leadership position in the data and AI space continues to rise sharply as well.""

Oracle AI Database 26ai is a long-term support release that replaces Oracle Database 23ai. Customers can simply apply the October 2025 release update to transition from 23ai to the currently available features of 26ai. Customers will receive the immediately available features and will be ready for additional features as they are released. There is no database upgrade or application re-certification required. Advanced AI features such as AI Vector Search are included at no additional charge.

Oracle AI Database 26ai features that are planned include:

Now available on OCI, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Exadata Cloud@Customer

LAS VEGAS,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Oracle AI World --Oracle today introduced Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse, an open, interoperable data platform. It combines Oracle Autonomous AI Database with the popular Apache Iceberg standard to avoid functionality tradeoffs, break down analytic silos, and accelerate how teams build AI and analytics solutions. Oracle also introduced Autonomous AI Database Catalog—a ""catalog of catalogs"" that unifies enterprise data and metadata from other catalogs and platforms—to simplify data discovery and access across multiple data platforms and clouds.

""With Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse, we are offering customers a lakehouse platform without compromise by combining the highly trusted and industry-hardened Autonomous AI Database—executing in excess of 48 billion queries per hour—with the openness of Apache Iceberg,"" said Çetin Özbütün, executive vice president, Autonomous Database Technologies, Oracle. ""Not only is Oracle breaking down the data silos between analytic systems with Iceberg, we are also enabling customers to access Iceberg data in any platform—operational or analytic—in the cloud or on-premises.""

With native support for Apache Iceberg, Autonomous AI Lakehouse provides simple, high-performance access to any Iceberg table by integrating with catalogs including Databricks Unity, AWS Glue, and Snowflake Polaris. Powerful capabilities such as Select AI—which provides natural language-to-SQL transformation and an agentic AI framework—along with JSON-Relational Duality, Property Graph Analytics, and AI Vector Search are available for processing data on Iceberg tables—all underpinned by the performance, availability, and security of Exadata but with vendor independence and while avoiding the operational drag of data movement. Autonomous AI Lakehouse is available on OCI, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Exadata Cloud@Customer.

""Customers consistently tell us they want to use the tools they already have on top of their data,"" said Stephen Orban, senior vice president, Product Ecosystem & Partnerships, Databricks. ""Databricks is committed to open and interoperable data access for analytics and AI, and Unity Catalog helps make that possible by providing a unified governance layer for formats like Apache Iceberg. We welcome Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse's integration with Unity Catalog, giving joint customers seamless access to their data and the flexibility to use Oracle and Databricks together.""

In addition, Oracle unveiled Data Lake Accelerator, which speeds large-scale queries across Iceberg tables by dynamically scaling network and compute capacity to Autonomous AI Database and bills only for the resources used.

""As part of Oracle's Limited Availability program for Data Lake Accelerator, SKY had the opportunity to test this new capability and was impressed by its performance,"" said Rosiane Porto, Data Services Team - Big Data, SKY Brazil. ""Data Lake Accelerator significantly improved query speeds on external data stored in object stores, enabling us to analyze large datasets faster and more efficiently—without moving data or changing our workflows. The ability to dynamically scale compute resources on demand gave us the flexibility to handle complex queries when needed, while keeping costs under control. We are excited about the potential of Data Lake Accelerator to simplify and accelerate external data processing for our business.""

Key features of Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse include:

""The days of trade-offs between enterprise-grade scalability and open source flexibility are over,"" said Ron Westfall, vice president, Practice Lead, Networking and Infrastructure, HyperFRAME Research. ""Oracle' s support for Apache Iceberg with Autonomous AI Lakehouse means organizations get cutting-edge AI, high-octane analytics, and secure, open access—all in one shot—on the hyperscaler cloud of their choice. By wrapping a 'catalog of catalogs' around Iceberg and its Autonomous AI Database, Oracle is making it radically simpler for teams to discover, secure, and leverage data everywhere. It's a game-changer for breaking down barriers in today's fragmented data landscape.""

(NASDAQ:RNAZ) announces completion of Phase 1a clinical trial with TTX-MC138, an investigational inhibitor of microRNA-10b, or miR-10b. By meeting its primary safety endpoint and defining a recommended Phase 2 dose, TTX-MC138 is moving forward into the next stage of clinical evaluation to assess its efficacy across selected metastatic diseases and for multiple indications.

Primary objectives of the trial focused on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (""PK"") and establishment of a Phase 2 dose (RP2D). A total of sixteen patients were treated across four escalating dose levels. No significant treatment-related safety events or dose limiting toxicities were observed.

TTX-MC138 was administered to 16 patients (77 total doses to date) with positive pharmacodynamic effects over all four administered dose range levels. Currently three patients remain on trial receiving TTX-MC138. The median treatment duration was four months. Importantly, the duration of treatment for all patients ranged from two to 12 cycles, indicative of tolerability and disease control. Forty-four per cent or seven out of sixteen patients were classified as having stable disease lasting 4 months or longer. Preliminary data in 16 patients showed positive pharmacodynamic effects over a wide dose range, consistent with preclinical models and TransCode's Phase 0 clinical trial. Of note, one patient diagnosed with thyroid cancer and historic evidence of an increase in thyroglobulin levels, demonstrated a reversal of the trend during treatment and presented at the most recent measurement with undetectable thyroglobulin levels.

Study investigator William McKean, MD, PhD (The START Center for Cancer Research) stated, ""The clinical benefit we are observing in patients treated with TTX-MC138 is compelling given the pre-clinical data and length of time the drug remains in the tumor cells"".

Data analysis and monitoring are ongoing.  A final clinical study report, scientific presentations and publications are planned.

The treatment response, safety and durability profile provides the basis for TransCode's decision to proceed with the TTX-MC138 program in a Phase 2a clinical trial. TransCode's Daniel Vlock, MD, Consulting Clinician noted ""the observed safety profile, coupled with the durability of TTX-MC138's anti-tumor effects, is particularly encouraging. These findings are consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and provide a basis for a more rigorous efficacy evaluation. This positions us to potentially intervene earlier in the patient's disease, offering a new therapeutic option for patients at risk of developing metastatic disease.""

Further information about the trial is available atwww.clinicaltrials.govNCT Identifier: (NCT06260774).

Preliminary data to be presented in a poster session at ESMO Congress October 17-21, 2025, taking place in Berlin, Germany. (FPN: 983P)

TTX-MC138 is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate designed to inhibit microRNA-10b, or miR-10b, a microRNA widely believed to be critical to the emergence and progression of many metastatic cancers. TransCode's Phase 0 clinical trial produced evidence of delivery of a radiolabeled version of TTX-MC138 to metastatic lesions and pharmacodynamic activity, even at a microdose of the drug candidate, suggesting a broad therapeutic window for TTX-MC138.

TransCode Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology and targeted cancer therapy company with a focus on treating advanced malignancy.  The company's lead therapeutic candidate, TTX-MC138, is focused on treating metastatic tumors that overexpress microRNA-10b, a unique, well-documented biomarker of metastasis. In addition, TransCode has a portfolio of other first-in-class therapeutic candidates designed to mobilize the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

LAS VEGAS,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Oracle AI World-- To help more customers gain the agility, economics, and scale of the public cloud, Oracle today announced the availability ofOracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Dedicated Region25. With OCI Dedicated Region25, organizations can rapidly deploy full-stack OCI in a Dedicated Region within weeks, starting as small as three racks in a space-constrained environment.

""Organizations want the freedom to run AI and cloud services where they deliver the most value, a need that's only growing as sovereign AI considerations drive stricter requirements around data location and control,"" said Scott Twaddle, senior vice president, Product and Industries, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. ""With OCI Dedicated Region25, we're bringing the full power of Oracle Cloud to virtually any data center. This new deployment option enables unmatched flexibility, operational simplicity, and enterprise-grade sovereignty—redefining what a dedicated cloud can be and helping ensure customers are ready for the future.""

With OCI Dedicated Region25, part of Oracle'sdistributed cloudportfolio, public and private organizations can increase agility and accelerate time-to-market by leveraging a sovereign, enterprise-grade cloud with modular infrastructure and streamlined service design. Only Oracle offers a complete public cloud region with 200+ AI and cloud services, deployable in as few as three racks, scalable to hyperscale, and securely run in customer data centers. This enables customers that previously lacked the space, time, or regulatory flexibility to run a dedicated cloud region to accelerate innovation and pursue new business models.

""As we continue to leverage the cloud to help deliver the best possible customer experience, gaining flexibility in how and where we deploy services has become a key element of our cloud strategy,"" said Kazushi Koga, corporate executive officer, SEVP, Head of Platform, Fujitsu Limited. ""With OCI Dedicated Region25delivering the full range of OCI services via a small physical footprint inside our own data centers, we will be able to deploy apps and services quickly and easily to our customers while benefiting from the flexibility to expand our deployment without downtime or re-architecting. As a result, OCI Dedicated Region25will enable us to run AI and cloud services anywhere they deliver the most value for our business.""

Since the introduction of OCI Dedicated Region in 2020, it has evolved from a large, hyperscale form factor to a far more flexible footprint. With more than 60 OCI Dedicated Regions and Oracle Alloy regions live or planned globally, customers can choose the deployment model that best fits their scale without compromising performance, governance, or compatibility with the public OCI experience.

Traditional dedicated cloud regions block many organizations from full cloud transformation. OCI Dedicated Region25removes these barriers by providing:

Ranked among the top 10 pediatric hospitals in the U.S., CHLA has nearly 8,000 employees and conducts more than 16,000 surgeries and 747,000 patient visits annually. Previously, CHLA had been using Oracle Base Database Service on OCI for its PeopleSoft enterprise resource planning and human capital management applications. To support continual growth, enhance data security, and boost performance and availability for an optimal user experience, CHLA needed a fully managed solution. After careful evaluation, CHLA selected Oracle Autonomous AI Database to support its business systems and has embarked on a long-term plan to move finance, HR, supply chain, and customer experience processes to Oracle Fusion Applications.

7MW4911 is an investigational CDH17-targeting ADC developed using Mabwell's proprietary IDDC™ platform. Its highly optimized structure integrates three key elements:

- Mab0727: A highly specific CDH17 monoclonal antibody with rapid internalization properties, cross-species (human/monkey) moderate affinity, and minimal off-target binding.

- Novel cleavable linker: Ensures precise payload release in tumor tissues.

- MF-6 payload: A proprietary DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor designed to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR), exhibiting superior plasma stability, controlled drug release, and potent bystander effects.

In July 2025, Mabwell published preclinical data in Cell Reports Medicine (""Overcoming multidrug resistance in gastrointestinal cancers with a CDH17-targeted ADC conjugated to a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor""), demonstrating 7MW4911's tumor-selective cytotoxicity via CDH17-mediated internalization. Key advantages include:

- Optimized molecular design: Homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR=4, >95%) and stable linker confer exceptional plasma stability, while membrane-permeable MF-6 drives potent bystander killing.

- Broad Antitumor Efficacy: Demonstrates robust tumor regression in colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer PDX/CDX models, including tumors with RAS/BRAF mutations and diverse Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS).

- MDR resistance: Outperforms MMAE/DXd-based ADCs in ABC transporter-mediated MDR models and reverses tumor progression post-ADC treatment.

- Target versatility: Active even in tumors with low-to-moderate CDH17 expression, expanding potential patient eligibility.

- Favorable safety profile: Limited tissue distribution in mice, controllable pharmacokinetics (moderate half-life, no accumulation), and a wide therapeutic window in cynomolgus monkeys, with no significant toxicity signals.

With this profile, 7MW4911 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for advanced gastrointestinal cancers. 7MW4911 has also received IND clearance from US FDA to initiate clinical study in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and other advanced gastrointestinal tumors.

CDH17 is a pan-cancer validated target with restricted expression in normal intestinal epithelium but marked overexpression in gastrointestinal cancers (e.g., colorectal, gastric, pancreatic). Its aberrant expression correlates with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis, positioning it as an ideal therapeutic target.

Mabwell (688062.SH) is an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company with capabilities spanning the entire pharmaceutical value chain. The company is committed to providing more effective and accessible therapies to meet global medical needs, with a focus on oncology and aging-related diseases. Mabwell's mission is ""Explore Life, Benefit Health"" and its vision is ""Innovation, from Ideas to Reality."" For more information, please visitwww.mabwell.com/en.

By the end of the year, the airline expects to have an additional aircraft type certified to offer Starlink.

More than 170 customers onboard the Boeing 737-800 will enjoy the same kind of high-speed, low-latency internet experience they have at home, unlocking experiences like live TV and streaming services, shopping, gaming and more. On October 15, the Starlink-equipped mainline aircraft is also expected to fly from Houston (IAH) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on flight 365 and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Houston (IAH) on flight 445 where it will end the day in Houston.

United will install two Starlink antennas on each 737-800 aircraft. The airline is set to install nearly 2,940 antennas across its entire fleet – the flight number for the first customer flight.

Starlink Wi-Fi is free for United MileagePlus®members, and customers will receive a notification before their flight if it's equipped with Starlink.

""We're committed to raising the bar when it comes to the onboard experience, and with Starlink, we're changing how people fly,"" said David Kinzelman, United's Chief Customer Officer. ""Whether it's catching a live game, streaming an award show or working, United customers won't miss a beat when they're onboard a Starlink-equipped flight.""

United's Starlink is breaking the Wi-Fi barrier, and the new service unlocks a new way to travel with experiences like:

United's first Starlink-equipped regional flight took place on a regional jet in May 2025, and the airline now has Starlink installed on more than half of the aircraft in its regional fleet. Initial customer scores on those flights have been noteworthy with 90% of customers appreciating the ability to stream onboard with Starlink's high-speed, easy-to-use and consistent connection.

The rollout of Starlink across United's fleet aligns with the airline's plans to have 300,000+ seatback screens across its fleet – more than any other U.S. airline – as it takes delivery of hundreds of new airplanes and retrofits existing aircraft. Over the last several years, United has invested billions of dollars in enhancing the customer experience, and by providing more value for customers, the airline aims to earn stronger brand loyalty.

PowerBank intends to develop, finance and construct the Projects, a combination of behind-the-meter systems and community solar projects on land owned by the DMNA. Once operational, the clean energy generated by the Projects will be sold to the DMNA under long term power purchase agreements that have an initial term of 20 years or will be sold to local residents through community solar subscriptions.

PowerBank, through its US subsidiary Abundant Solar Power, was selected in a competitive bidding process managed by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) for the development of the Projects with DMNA. The portfolio consists of approximately 19MW of solar photovoltaic systems and 1MW/2MWh of battery energy storage.  Individual systems will be located at a variety of New York Army National Guard facilities or properties across New York State administered by the DMNA.  Developing the portfolio will help DMNA meet a variety of resiliency, climate, and economic savings goals. Construction is expected to start by the end of the 2025 calendar year.

Dr. Richard Lu, President & CEO of PowerBank commented: ""This is another exciting development project for PowerBank. With over a decade of experience as a trusted developer of power projects, PowerBank was able to secure the support of the DMNA to develop these projects that will provide sustainable green energy and resiliency services for years to come.""

""The Division of Military and Naval Affairs is looking forward to partnering with PowerBank and the New York Power Authority to bring this first of its kind 20-megawatt renewable energy and microgrid project to our Camp Smith Training Site and facilities in Ithaca, Kingston, and Newark.  This project will decrease utility costs and increase energy resiliency while making significant progress towards meeting Governor Hochul's efforts to reduce carbon emissions"", said Major General Ray Shields, the Adjutant General of New York.

Justin E. Driscoll, President and CEO of the Power Authority, said: ""The Power Authority is pleased to collaborate with PowerBank on this extensive set of projects that will make the Department of Military and Naval Affairs one of New York State's leaders in on-site solar generation. Public-private partnerships that provide power and help local residents through utility bill credits are a significant factor in delivering New York State's reliable, affordable and clean energy future.""

The DMNA is New York State's executive agency responsible to the governor for managing New York's military forces, which consist of nearly 20,000 personnel. DMNA has direct responsibility to maintain and secure more than 50 installations across the Empire State. These installations are state owned or federally licensed properties which include air bases, armories, armed forces readiness centers and other logistical and training sites.

Some of the projects in the portfolio will be operated as community solar projects. The clean energy generated by a community solar project feeds directly into the local electricity grid. Depending on the size and number of panels the project has, dozens or even hundreds of renters and homeowners can earn credits on their electric bill and save money from the electricity that is generated by the project. By subscribing to a project, community members can access the benefits of renewable energy without having to install panels on their home. PowerBank's strategic focus on community solar aligns with its goal of powering thousands of homes with clean and affordable energy.

Any project development is subject to receipt of interconnection approval, required permits, the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project and battery energy storage project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future projects no longer being economically feasible. Please refer to ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the statements in this press release.

PowerBank Corporation is an independent renewable and clean energy project developer and owner focusing on distributed and community solar projects in Canada and the USA. The Company develops solar and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) projects that sell electricity to utilities, commercial, industrial, municipal and residential off-takers. The Company maximizes returns via a diverse portfolio of projects across multiple leading North America markets including projects with utilities, host off-takers, community solar, and virtual net metering projects. The Company has a potential development pipeline of over one gigawatt and has developed renewable and clean energy projects with a combined capacity of over 100 megawatts built.

Number of pharmacy technicians who want to become pharmacists has increased significantly since 2024

WOONSOCKET, R.I.,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- CVS Health® (NYSE:CVS) today released the 2025Rx Report: Community Pharmacy Reimagined, which explores how community pharmacies are adapting to meet patient demand while supporting pharmacy teams and addressing industry challenges with sustainable models of care.

""As one of the most trusted health care brands, CVS Pharmacy® is committed to delivering personalized, accessible care that meets patients where they are,"" said Len Shankman, Executive Vice President and President of Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health. ""Our latest Rx Report shows that patients want more care from their local pharmacies, and pharmacy teams are ready to provide it. By combining the power of human connection with innovative digital tools and a more sustainable reimbursement model, we're building the future of community pharmacy today.""

The 2025 Rx Report is based on a CVS Health survey of more than 2,200 consumers and more than 1,060 pharmacists and pharmacy technicians1, revealing several trends:

""Community pharmacy teams do so much more than fill prescriptions and, as patients increasingly rely on them for local access to care, we are reimagining the role they play to have an even greater impact on public health,"" said Lucille Accetta, Senior Vice President and Chief Pharmacy Officer, CVS Health. ""It's why we're continuing to develop new ways to support our colleagues, giving them more time to care for patients, advancing smart public policy that enables them to play an expanded care role and helping to champion the next generation of community pharmacists.""

The recent CVS Health survey data indicates that patients prefer face-to-face care over digital-only options. CVS Pharmacy's approach is tech-enabled but powered by colleagues – prioritizing the long-standing trust of pharmacy teams in local communities and using technology in innovative new ways to enhance pharmacist-patient interactions.

To meet growing patient needs in local communities, CVS Pharmacy is also expanding access by opening nearly 100 new community locations this year — including more than 60 acquired from Rite Aid in the Pacific Northwest. The company is also launchingnew small-format storesin underserved areas, which will offer full prescription services, immunizations, refills and medication support, along with a curated selection of health essentials.

Smart technology supports pharmacy teams and patients

Survey results also highlight the importance of supporting pharmacy teams, with two-thirds of retail pharmacists saying technology integration can improve workflow and patient care. CVS Pharmacy continues to invest in innovations that support its pharmacy colleagues, including a dynamic workload-sharing model, SmartDUR™ drug utilization review system, and a modernized pharmacy operating system developed with input from colleagues themselves.

An expanded scope of practice – such as prescribing certain medications – is among the top changes pharmacy professionals want to see in the industry over the next several years. CVS Pharmacy has expanded the types of care and services it provides – from administering more than a dozen vaccines to testing for certain illnesses and prescribing certain therapies, where allowed by state law, and performing comprehensive medication reviews. But there is still more that both pharmacists and technicians can do to play an expanded role in public health.

It is why the company is also advocating for public policy solutions that support sustainable pharmacy care. This includes supporting the Ensuring Community Access to Pharmacy Services Act of 2025 (H.R. 3164/S.2426), which would help preserve access to pharmacist-led testing and services that have become mainstays since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report underscores the need for new reimbursement models to stabilize community pharmacies, as traditional market-basket approaches have challenged community pharmacies.

CVS CostVantage™, the company's cost-based pricing framework, establishes reimbursement based on actual drug cost, a defined markup and a dispensing fee, delivering transparency for payors while ensuring fair compensation for pharmacy services. In 2026, the company plans to transition several government services programs to the cost-based pricing model.

CVS Health is also addressing workforce sustainability with investments in tuition assistance, scholarships and partnerships with pharmacy schools. Through programs such as the PharmD Tuition Assistance Program and partnerships with the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy and Duquesne University, CVS Health is helping to prepare tomorrow's pharmacy leaders.

Community pharmacy is at an inflection point. To meet rising demand and market pressures, the industry must evolve by combining technology that drives convenience with the human connections patients trust most. With more than 9,000 community health destinations and a 60-year legacy of innovation, CVS Pharmacy is reimagining what local pharmacy care can be — because the future starts now.

LAS VEGAS,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- At the annual meeting of the National Business Aviation Association yesterday, Pratt & Whitney Canada joined Textron Aviation to celebrate the world debut of the Cessna Citation Ascend. The new business jet is powered by twin PW545D engines. Pratt & Whitney is an RTX (NYSE:RTX) business.

SEATTLE and NEW YORK,Oct. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Renters who pay on time deserve credit for it. Zillow® is expanding its rent reporting capabilities through a new partnership with Esusu, making it easier for millions of renters tobuild their credit historyand improve financial readiness for their next move.

Under this expansion, any renter — not just those paying rent through Zillow — can now have their on-time rent payments reported to all major credit bureaus for $20 per year. Starting in November, renters simply verify their lease details and payment method, and Zillow and Esusu handle the rest.

Zillow first launched free rent reporting in early 2024 for renters who pay through Zillow, and so far has reported on-time payments to help more than 141,000 renters. Esusu, the market leader in rent reporting, has seen an average positive credit score increase of 45 points for renters in its program. With this partnership, Zillow and Esusu aim to reach millions more renters, especially those seeking to improve their credit standing and move closer to homeownership.

""Paying rent is often a renter's biggest and most consistent monthly expense. It makes sense that this payment should help build their credit."" said Michael Sherman, senior vice president of Zillow Rentals. ""By expanding rent reporting, we're helping more renters build their credit history and take control of their financial future while reinforcing Zillow's role as a trusted partner throughout their housing journey.""

Rent reporting is a key part ofZillow's broader effort to help renters and buyersaccess and afford housing. About87% of rentersdon't currently see their rent payments reflected in their credit reports — a gap that can hold back those with limited or no credit history. By making credit-building easier and more accessible, Zillow and Esusu are helping more renters turn responsible renting intoreal financial progress.

""At Esusu, we believe everyone deserves credit for paying their rent on time. By including rent in the credit system, we're helping to build economic mobility and unlock the American Dream for millions,"" said Esusu Co-Founders and Co-CEOs Wemimo Abbey and Samir Goel. ""We are proud to partner with Zillow to reimagine financial access and open the pathway to homeownership and generational wealth.""

The Administration's announcement earlier this year authorizingFannie Mae and Freddie Mac to accept loans using VantageScore 4.0makes rental payment reporting more impactful than ever. These significant changes better incorporate rental payment history into the lending process, which could expand access to the American Dream of homeownership through rent reporting. Illustratively, renters on the Esusu platform have unlocked over $30 billion in mortgages after participating in rent reporting.

Renters can sign up for rent reporting directly through Zillow to start having their payments reported each month. More information about Zillow's current program is available atZillow.com/rent/rent-reporting.

Under the agreements, Boeing will deliver more than 3,000 seekers at rates of up to 750 units per year through 2030.

Boeing is working closely with prime contractor Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Army to further increase production rates and meet new targets for the PAC‑3 interceptor. Scaling seeker output is critical to ensuring the Patriot system can continue to defend service members, civilians and critical infrastructure worldwide as threats proliferate.

Boeing is working closely with prime contractor Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Army to further increase production rates and meet new targets for the PAC‑3 interceptor. Scaling seeker output is critical to ensuring the Patriot system can continue to defend service members, civilians and critical infrastructure worldwide as threats proliferate.

""Our team has never been better positioned to answer the nation's call for greater air and missile defense,"" said Jim Bryan, executive director of Boeing Integrated Air & Missile Defense. ""These multiyear awards recognize the progress we've made and will allow us to meet growing global demand for the PAC‑3 seeker.""

Boeing‑built PAC‑3 seekers enable Patriot interceptors to identify, track and defeat advanced threats, including hypersonic threats, hostile aircraft, and ballistic and cruise missiles. Demand for PAC‑3 interceptors has grown in response to recent conflicts and rapidly changing threat environments in Ukraine, the Middle East and the Indo‑Pacific.

In 2025, the company set new monthly and 12‑month rolling average production records and is targeting delivery of a record 650 to 700 seekers by year's end. Years of internal investment, modernization of production lines, strengthened supplier partnerships and the completion of a new 35,000‑square‑foot factory expansion have increased Boeing's production capacity.

Since 2000, Boeing has delivered more than 6,000 increasingly sophisticated PAC‑3 seekers to the U.S. Army as a Lockheed Martin subcontractor from its Huntsville, Alabama facilities. Seventeen countries, including the United States, rely on PAC‑3 interceptors to protect people and critical infrastructure around the globe.

A leading global aerospace company and top U.S. exporter, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. Our U.S. and global workforce and supplier base drive innovation, economic opportunity, sustainability and community impact. Boeing is committed to fostering a culture based on our core values of safety, quality and integrity.
