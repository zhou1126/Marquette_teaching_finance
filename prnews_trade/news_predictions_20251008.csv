SANFORD, Fla.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Hoverfly Technologies, the leading provider of tethered drone systems for defense and security, is proud to announce the successful close of its $20 million Series B funding round, led by existing investor Leonardo DRS (DRS) and new partner Korea Robot Manufacturing (KRM).

The investment is the single largest capital raise in company history and will support Hoverfly's continued dominance of the tethered drone sector, which is at the forefront of U.S. and allied defense initiatives.

Learn more about Hoverfly Technologies athoverflytech.com.

Leonardo DRS, Inc. (Nasdaq:DRS), a leading provider of advanced defense technologies, invested $15 million in this round, reaffirming its confidence in Hoverfly's business model and vision for sustained growth. As part of the investment, Hoverfly signed a manufacturing agreement with DRS to expand production of the Hoverfly Sentry and to launch a new production line for theHoverfly Spectre system.

""Our continued investment in Hoverfly Technologies reflects our unwavering confidence in their innovative tethered drone solutions,"" said Aaron Hankins, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Leonardo DRS Land Systems Business Unit, and a member of the Hoverfly Board of Directors. ""This partnership enables us to bolster U.S. defense capabilities through expanded domestic production and aligns with our shared commitment to strengthening national security.""

Korea Robot Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (KRM) is a South Korean engineering and manufacturing company specializing in sensors and advanced technologies for quadrupedal robots and UAVs. KRM invested $5 million in this round. As part of its U.S. expansion, KRM will partner with Hoverfly to establish a new facility dedicated to the domestic production of key components—strengthening support for the U.S. defense sector and enhancing supply chain resilience.

To ensure long-term stability in sourcing critical materials, KRM has secured a reliable supply of high-performance components through a strategic partnership with a supplier outside traditional high-risk regions. This move ensures Hoverfly access to a stable, U.S.-based supply of essential inputs. Through this investment, KRM becomes Hoverfly's exclusive manufacturer of key components and preferred vendor for future component needs.

""Partnering with Hoverfly enables us to establish a U.S.-based supply chain for critical UAV components—a strategic move aligned with national security priorities, especially amid restrictions on imports from traditional high-risk regions,"" said Kwangsik Park, CEO of KRM.

Both DRS and KRM will now serve as official resellers and integrators of Hoverfly's Sentry and Spectre systems, further expanding Hoverfly's global reach and production capacity.

""This funding round marks a defining moment for our company,"" said Steve Walters, CEO of Hoverfly Technologies. ""With the backing of world-class international partners like DRS and KRM, we are poised to rapidly scale operations, expand product offering, and capture new markets, to further establish our market leadership and continue delivering systems that advance and unleash U.S. drone dominance.""

Hoverfly's investment comes at a pivotal time as theU.S. Department of Defense prioritizes the development of secure, American-made unmanned systems. As the only tethered drone on the DIU Blue List, the company's technology offers a trusted, domestically sourced alternative to foreign drone manufacturers, aligning directly with U.S. national security objectives.

By partnering with KRM, Hoverfly is taking its first strategic steps into custom and broadly adopted, expendable drone key components. The goal is straightforward: leverage KRM's leading engineering and reliability to supply U.S. end-users with cost-effective, high-performance technology.

Hoverfly'snewest capabilityNEXUS(Network Extension of Unmanned Systems) also supports the rapidly growing need for unmanned ecosystems—a critical infrastructure that emerged from the war in Ukraine. Adopted by the U.S. Army in concept and demonstrated alongside industry partners, NEXUS allows Hoverfly to function as both targeting and command-and-control system, significantly extending ranges Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconaissance (ISR), First-Person View (FPV), and loitering drone munitions across land, sea, and air domains. This innovative capability positions Hoverfly as a combat multiplier ready to lead the next wave of U.S. drone defense evolution.

Though the tethered drone sector remains niche, it continues to expand rapidly with industry forecasts projecting growth from approximately $140 million in 2023 to over $2.6 billion by 2032 at a combined annual growth rate of 38%. Hoverfly has already sold over800 tethered dronesto U.S. and allied defense customers, demonstrating strong market traction and underscoring that our technology addresses mission-critical needs for persistent ISR, targeting, and tactical network extension.

Hoverfly Technologies (Sanford, Florida) is a U.S. based innovator and supplier of tethered drone systems tailored for defense and security applications. Its flagship platforms, Sentry and Spectre, enable extended duration, persistent aerial surveillance, and network extension. Founded to serve mission-critical needs, Hoverfly delivers trusted, American-made systems with expanding production and industry partnerships. Hoverfly also provides training, spare parts, and global maintenance worldwide to its large installed base.

SANFORD, Fla.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Hoverfly Technologies, the leading provider of tethered drone systems for defense and security, is proud to announce the successful close of its $20 million Series B funding round, led by existing investor Leonardo DRS (DRS) and new partner Korea Robot Manufacturing (KRM).

The investment is the single largest capital raise in company history and will support Hoverfly's continued dominance of the tethered drone sector, which is at the forefront of U.S. and allied defense initiatives.

Leonardo DRS, Inc. (Nasdaq:DRS), a leading provider of advanced defense technologies, invested $15 million in this round, reaffirming its confidence in Hoverfly's business model and vision for sustained growth. As part of the investment, Hoverfly signed a manufacturing agreement with DRS to expand production of the Hoverfly Sentry and to launch a new production line for theHoverfly Spectre system.

""Our continued investment in Hoverfly Technologies reflects our unwavering confidence in their innovative tethered drone solutions,"" said Aaron Hankins, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Leonardo DRS Land Systems Business Unit, and a member of the Hoverfly Board of Directors. ""This partnership enables us to bolster U.S. defense capabilities through expanded domestic production and aligns with our shared commitment to strengthening national security.""

Korea Robot Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (KRM) is a South Korean engineering and manufacturing company specializing in sensors and advanced technologies for quadrupedal robots and UAVs. KRM invested $5 million in this round. As part of its U.S. expansion, KRM will partner with Hoverfly to establish a new facility dedicated to the domestic production of key components—strengthening support for the U.S. defense sector and enhancing supply chain resilience.

To ensure long-term stability in sourcing critical materials, KRM has secured a reliable supply of high-performance components through a strategic partnership with a supplier outside traditional high-risk regions. This move ensures Hoverfly access to a stable, U.S.-based supply of essential inputs. Through this investment, KRM becomes Hoverfly's exclusive manufacturer of key components and preferred vendor for future component needs.

""Partnering with Hoverfly enables us to establish a U.S.-based supply chain for critical UAV components—a strategic move aligned with national security priorities, especially amid restrictions on imports from traditional high-risk regions,"" said Kwangsik Park, CEO of KRM.

Both DRS and KRM will now serve as official resellers and integrators of Hoverfly's Sentry and Spectre systems, further expanding Hoverfly's global reach and production capacity.

""This funding round marks a defining moment for our company,"" said Steve Walters, CEO of Hoverfly Technologies. ""With the backing of world-class international partners like DRS and KRM, we are poised to rapidly scale operations, expand product offering, and capture new markets, to further establish our market leadership and continue delivering systems that advance and unleash U.S. drone dominance.""

Hoverfly's investment comes at a pivotal time as theU.S. Department of Defense prioritizes the development of secure, American-made unmanned systems. As the only tethered drone on the DIU Blue List, the company's technology offers a trusted, domestically sourced alternative to foreign drone manufacturers, aligning directly with U.S. national security objectives.

By partnering with KRM, Hoverfly is taking its first strategic steps into custom and broadly adopted, expendable drone key components. The goal is straightforward: leverage KRM's leading engineering and reliability to supply U.S. end-users with cost-effective, high-performance technology.

Hoverfly'snewest capabilityNEXUS(Network Extension of Unmanned Systems) also supports the rapidly growing need for unmanned ecosystems—a critical infrastructure that emerged from the war in Ukraine. Adopted by the U.S. Army in concept and demonstrated alongside industry partners, NEXUS allows Hoverfly to function as both targeting and command-and-control system, significantly extending ranges Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconaissance (ISR), First-Person View (FPV), and loitering drone munitions across land, sea, and air domains. This innovative capability positions Hoverfly as a combat multiplier ready to lead the next wave of U.S. drone defense evolution.

Though the tethered drone sector remains niche, it continues to expand rapidly with industry forecasts projecting growth from approximately $140 million in 2023 to over $2.6 billion by 2032 at a combined annual growth rate of 38%. Hoverfly has already sold over800 tethered dronesto U.S. and allied defense customers, demonstrating strong market traction and underscoring that our technology addresses mission-critical needs for persistent ISR, targeting, and tactical network extension.

Hoverfly Technologies (Sanford, Florida) is a U.S. based innovator and supplier of tethered drone systems tailored for defense and security applications. Its flagship platforms, Sentry and Spectre, enable extended duration, persistent aerial surveillance, and network extension. Founded to serve mission-critical needs, Hoverfly delivers trusted, American-made systems with expanding production and industry partnerships. Hoverfly also provides training, spare parts, and global maintenance worldwide to its large installed base.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence. Multiple blood tests from thefirst fourpatients showed measurable increases in natural killer cell activity and expansion, and the first patient in Cohort 3 has shown promising evidence of immune activation consistent with levels of activity observed in patients from the previous two lower-dose cohorts. This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma. ""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550).""

Beyond blood cancers,GT Biopharmahas a second drug candidate moving toward the clinic.

Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXEO)has achievedsignificant progresswith the FDA regarding its LX2006 gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy, with the agency indicating openness to pooling Phase I/II data with pivotal study data to support an accelerated approval pathway. Interim clinical data showed participants with abnormal left ventricular mass index achieved an 18% mean reduction at 6 months and 23% mean reduction at 12 months, exceeding the FDA-aligned 10% threshold, while more than 70% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures.

""We are encouraged by our recent dialogue with the FDA on LX2006, and we appreciate the Agency's collaborative spirit as we work to deliver a potentially life-changing therapy to the FA community as efficiently as possible,"" said R. Nolan Townsend, CEO ofLexeo Therapeutics. ""Given the highly compelling data to date that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures of FA, we are now pursuing a development strategy that could enable a smaller pivotal study, given the potential to pool data with the ongoing Phase I/II trials, as well as potentially assessing the co-primary endpoint of LVMI earlier than 12 months.""

The company plans to initiate its pivotal study in the first half of 2026, with LX2006 having received Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Treatment with LX2006 has been generally well tolerated with no Grade 3+ serious adverse events to date across 17 participants.

Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANIX)has completed thefinal patient visitin its Phase 1 breast cancer vaccine clinical trial, marking a major milestone in the first-in-human evaluation of this novel vaccine invented atCleveland Clinic. The trial enrolled 35 women across three cohorts: 26 patients with triple-negative breast cancer at risk of recurrence, four in a prevention group with genetic mutations who elected preventive mastectomy, and five receiving the vaccine concurrently with pembrolizumab.

""While cancer vaccines have historically faced considerable challenges, our approach targets a novel antigen that has not been explored in this setting,"" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences. ""We believe this strategy could represent a new paradigm in immuno-oncology, with potential utility in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.""

Cleveland Clinicwill present full clinical results at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 11, 2025, following submission of the final study report to the U.S. Department of Defense and a Clinical Study Report to the FDA.

Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:TEM)subsidiaryAmbry Geneticshas announced anenhanced breast cancer risk assessmentsolution through its Ambry CARE Program that integrates breast density into the Tyrer-Cuzick scoring model within electronic health records. The enhancement addresses a critical gap in breast cancer screening, as 93% of women with elevated risk who qualify for breast MRI based on medical and family history never receive one, with the updated tool providing four Tyrer-Cuzick score options aligned with BI-RADS breast density categories to guide screening decisions.

""Accurately assessing breast cancer risk is key to improving outcomes, but important factors like breast density often get overlooked,"" said Tom Schoenherr, CEO ofAmbry Genetics. ""By bringing together Tyrer-Cuzick scoring and breast density right in the EHR, CARE shows how Ambry is making it easier for providers to get actionable insights within their workflow, ultimately helping patients get the care they need.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated that CARE interprets NCCN Guidelines with 99.5% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability as a trusted digital risk assessment tool for clinicians and patients.

Citius Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTOR)has establishedinternational accessto LYMPHIR (denileukin diftitox-cxdl) through Named Patient Programs in Europe, South America and the Middle East, including an exclusive distribution agreement withIntegris Pharma S.A.covering Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia. LYMPHIR, approved by the FDA in August 2024 for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy, targets an initial U.S. market that management estimates exceeds $400 million and continues to grow.

""As we prepare to launch LYMPHIR in the U.S., expanding access to international markets through Named Patient Programs is both a patient-driven mission and a strategic opportunity for Citius Oncology,"" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO ofCitius OncologyandCitius Pharmaceuticals. ""These programs allow us to serve patients who urgently need new treatment options, while also giving physicians valuable firsthand experience with LYMPHIR. Our recently signed exclusive distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. further strengthens this effort, establishing a trusted partner to help us bring LYMPHIR to patients across Southern Europe and the Balkans.""

The company is in active discussions with multiple prospective distribution partners across several European Union member states, South America, and select Middle Eastern territories, reflecting its commitment to positioning LYMPHIR for growth in key markets outside the United States. Named Patient Programs provide formally recognized pathways for physicians to request promising therapies on behalf of individual patients when no adequate approved alternatives exist, bridging the gap between clinical trial completion and broad market introduction while LYMPHIR remains available only through country-specific programs where permitted by local law.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence. Multiple blood tests from thefirst fourpatients showed measurable increases in natural killer cell activity and expansion, and the first patient in Cohort 3 has shown promising evidence of immune activation consistent with levels of activity observed in patients from the previous two lower-dose cohorts. This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma. ""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550).""

Beyond blood cancers,GT Biopharmahas a second drug candidate moving toward the clinic. GTB-5550 targets a protein called B7H3 that appears in many different types of solid tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers.

Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXEO)has achievedsignificant progresswith the FDA regarding its LX2006 gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy, with the agency indicating openness to pooling Phase I/II data with pivotal study data to support an accelerated approval pathway. Interim clinical data showed participants with abnormal left ventricular mass index achieved an 18% mean reduction at 6 months and 23% mean reduction at 12 months, exceeding the FDA-aligned 10% threshold, while more than 70% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures.

""We are encouraged by our recent dialogue with the FDA on LX2006, and we appreciate the Agency's collaborative spirit as we work to deliver a potentially life-changing therapy to the FA community as efficiently as possible,"" said R. Nolan Townsend, CEO ofLexeo Therapeutics. ""Given the highly compelling data to date that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures of FA, we are now pursuing a development strategy that could enable a smaller pivotal study, given the potential to pool data with the ongoing Phase I/II trials, as well as potentially assessing the co-primary endpoint of LVMI earlier than 12 months.""

The company plans to initiate its pivotal study in the first half of 2026, with LX2006 having received Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Treatment with LX2006 has been generally well tolerated with no Grade 3+ serious adverse events to date across 17 participants.

Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANIX)has completed thefinal patient visitin its Phase 1 breast cancer vaccine clinical trial, marking a major milestone in the first-in-human evaluation of this novel vaccine invented atCleveland Clinic. The trial enrolled 35 women across three cohorts: 26 patients with triple-negative breast cancer at risk of recurrence, four in a prevention group with genetic mutations who elected preventive mastectomy, and five receiving the vaccine concurrently with pembrolizumab.

""While cancer vaccines have historically faced considerable challenges, our approach targets a novel antigen that has not been explored in this setting,"" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences. ""We believe this strategy could represent a new paradigm in immuno-oncology, with potential utility in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.""

Cleveland Clinicwill present full clinical results at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 11, 2025, following submission of the final study report to the U.S. Department of Defense and a Clinical Study Report to the FDA.

Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:TEM)subsidiaryAmbry Geneticshas announced anenhanced breast cancer risk assessmentsolution through its Ambry CARE Program that integrates breast density into the Tyrer-Cuzick scoring model within electronic health records. The enhancement addresses a critical gap in breast cancer screening, as 93% of women with elevated risk who qualify for breast MRI based on medical and family history never receive one, with the updated tool providing four Tyrer-Cuzick score options aligned with BI-RADS breast density categories to guide screening decisions.

""Accurately assessing breast cancer risk is key to improving outcomes, but important factors like breast density often get overlooked,"" said Tom Schoenherr, CEO ofAmbry Genetics. ""By bringing together Tyrer-Cuzick scoring and breast density right in the EHR, CARE shows how Ambry is making it easier for providers to get actionable insights within their workflow, ultimately helping patients get the care they need.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated that CARE interprets NCCN Guidelines with 99.5% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability as a trusted digital risk assessment tool for clinicians and patients.

Citius Oncology, Inc.

LYMPHIR, approved by the FDA in August 2024 for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy, targets an initial U.S. market that management estimates exceeds $400 million and continues to grow.

""As we prepare to launch LYMPHIR in the U.S., expanding access to international markets through Named Patient Programs is both a patient-driven mission and a strategic opportunity for Citius Oncology,"" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO ofCitius OncologyandCitius Pharmaceuticals. ""These programs allow us to serve patients who urgently need new treatment options, while also giving physicians valuable firsthand experience with LYMPHIR. Our recently signed exclusive distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. further strengthens this effort, establishing a trusted partner to help us bring LYMPHIR to patients across Southern Europe and the Balkans.""

The company is in active discussions with multiple prospective distribution partners across several European Union member states, South America, and select Middle Eastern territories, reflecting its commitment to positioning LYMPHIR for growth in key markets outside the United States. Named Patient Programs provide formally recognized pathways for physicians to request promising therapies on behalf of individual patients when no adequate approved alternatives exist, bridging the gap between clinical trial completion and broad market introduction while LYMPHIR remains available only through country-specific programs where permitted by local law.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence. Multiple blood tests from thefirst fourpatients showed measurable increases in natural killer cell activity and expansion, and the first patient in Cohort 3 has shown promising evidence of immune activation consistent with levels of activity observed in patients from the previous two lower-dose cohorts. This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma. ""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650.

""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550).""

Beyond blood cancers,GT Biopharmahas a second drug candidate moving toward the clinic. GTB-5550 targets a protein called B7H3 that appears in many different types of solid tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. The company expects tosubmit itsapplication to start human testing of GTB-5550 during the fourth quarter of this year. Unlike many cancer immunotherapies that require lengthy hospital infusions, GTB-5550 is being developed as a simple injection that patients could potentially give themselves at home, similar to insulin shots.

Both drug candidates are built onGT Biopharma'sproprietary TriKE platform, which uses specialized antibody fragments originally discovered in camels and llamas. These molecules are smaller and more stable than traditional antibodies, allowing them to work more effectively.GT Biopharmaholds an exclusive worldwide license from theUniversity of Minnesotato develop and commercialize therapies using this technology.

As of June 30, 2025,GT Biopharmareported cashand cash equivalents of approximately $5.3 million, which management expected would fund operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXEO)has achievedsignificant progresswith the FDA regarding its LX2006 gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy, with the agency indicating openness to pooling Phase I/II data with pivotal study data to support an accelerated approval pathway. Interim clinical data showed participants with abnormal left ventricular mass index achieved an 18% mean reduction at 6 months and 23% mean reduction at 12 months, exceeding the FDA-aligned 10% threshold, while more than 70% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures.

""We are encouraged by our recent dialogue with the FDA on LX2006, and we appreciate the Agency's collaborative spirit as we work to deliver a potentially life-changing therapy to the FA community as efficiently as possible,"" said R. Nolan Townsend, CEO ofLexeo Therapeutics. ""Given the highly compelling data to date that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures of FA, we are now pursuing a development strategy that could enable a smaller pivotal study, given the potential to pool data with the ongoing Phase I/II trials, as well as potentially assessing the co-primary endpoint of LVMI earlier than 12 months.""

The company plans to initiate its pivotal study in the first half of 2026, with LX2006 having received Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Treatment with LX2006 has been generally well tolerated with no Grade 3+ serious adverse events to date across 17 participants.

Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANIX)has completed thefinal patient visitin its Phase 1 breast cancer vaccine clinical trial, marking a major milestone in the first-in-human evaluation of this novel vaccine invented atCleveland Clinic. The trial enrolled 35 women across three cohorts: 26 patients with triple-negative breast cancer at risk of recurrence, four in a prevention group with genetic mutations who elected preventive mastectomy, and five receiving the vaccine concurrently with pembrolizumab.

""While cancer vaccines have historically faced considerable challenges, our approach targets a novel antigen that has not been explored in this setting,"" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences. ""We believe this strategy could represent a new paradigm in immuno-oncology, with potential utility in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.""

Cleveland Clinicwill present full clinical results at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 11, 2025, following submission of the final study report to the U.S. Department of Defense and a Clinical Study Report to the FDA.

Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:TEM)subsidiaryAmbry Geneticshas announced anenhanced breast cancer risk assessmentsolution through its Ambry CARE Program that integrates breast density into the Tyrer-Cuzick scoring model within electronic health records. The enhancement addresses a critical gap in breast cancer screening, as 93% of women with elevated risk who qualify for breast MRI based on medical and family history never receive one, with the updated tool providing four Tyrer-Cuzick score options aligned with BI-RADS breast density categories to guide screening decisions.

""Accurately assessing breast cancer risk is key to improving outcomes, but important factors like breast density often get overlooked,"" said Tom Schoenherr, CEO ofAmbry Genetics. ""By bringing together Tyrer-Cuzick scoring and breast density right in the EHR, CARE shows how Ambry is making it easier for providers to get actionable insights within their workflow, ultimately helping patients get the care they need.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated that CARE interprets NCCN Guidelines with 99.5% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability as a trusted digital risk assessment tool for clinicians and patients.

Citius Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTOR)has establishedinternational accessto LYMPHIR (denileukin diftitox-cxdl) through Named Patient Programs in Europe, South America and the Middle East, including an exclusive distribution agreement withIntegris Pharma S.A.covering Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia. LYMPHIR, approved by the FDA in August 2024 for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy, targets an initial U.S. market that management estimates exceeds $400 million and continues to grow.

""As we prepare to launch LYMPHIR in the U.S., expanding access to international markets through Named Patient Programs is both a patient-driven mission and a strategic opportunity for Citius Oncology,"" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO ofCitius OncologyandCitius Pharmaceuticals. ""These programs allow us to serve patients who urgently need new treatment options, while also giving physicians valuable firsthand experience with LYMPHIR. Our recently signed exclusive distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. further strengthens this effort, establishing a trusted partner to help us bring LYMPHIR to patients across Southern Europe and the Balkans.""

The company is in active discussions with multiple prospective distribution partners across several European Union member states, South America, and select Middle Eastern territories, reflecting its commitment to positioning LYMPHIR for growth in key markets outside the United States. Named Patient Programs provide formally recognized pathways for physicians to request promising therapies on behalf of individual patients when no adequate approved alternatives exist, bridging the gap between clinical trial completion and broad market introduction while LYMPHIR remains available only through country-specific programs where permitted by local law.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence. Multiple blood tests from thefirst fourpatients showed measurable increases in natural killer cell activity and expansion, and the first patient in Cohort 3 has shown promising evidence of immune activation consistent with levels of activity observed in patients from the previous two lower-dose cohorts. This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma.

The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma. ""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550).""

Beyond blood cancers,GT Biopharmahas a second drug candidate moving toward the clinic. GTB-5550 targets a protein called B7H3 that appears in many different types of solid tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. The company expects tosubmit itsapplication to start human testing of GTB-5550 during the fourth quarter of this year. Unlike many cancer immunotherapies that require lengthy hospital infusions, GTB-5550 is being developed as a simple injection that patients could potentially give themselves at home, similar to insulin shots.

Both drug candidates are built onGT Biopharma'sproprietary TriKE platform, which uses specialized antibody fragments originally discovered in camels and llamas. These molecules are smaller and more stable than traditional antibodies, allowing them to work more effectively.GT Biopharmaholds an exclusive worldwide license from theUniversity of Minnesotato develop and commercialize therapies using this technology.

As of June 30, 2025,GT Biopharmareported cashand cash equivalents of approximately $5.3 million, which management expected would fund operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXEO)has achievedsignificant progresswith the FDA regarding its LX2006 gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy, with the agency indicating openness to pooling Phase I/II data with pivotal study data to support an accelerated approval pathway. Interim clinical data showed participants with abnormal left ventricular mass index achieved an 18% mean reduction at 6 months and 23% mean reduction at 12 months, exceeding the FDA-aligned 10% threshold, while more than 70% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures.

""We are encouraged by our recent dialogue with the FDA on LX2006, and we appreciate the Agency's collaborative spirit as we work to deliver a potentially life-changing therapy to the FA community as efficiently as possible,"" said R. Nolan Townsend, CEO ofLexeo Therapeutics. ""Given the highly compelling data to date that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures of FA, we are now pursuing a development strategy that could enable a smaller pivotal study, given the potential to pool data with the ongoing Phase I/II trials, as well as potentially assessing the co-primary endpoint of LVMI earlier than 12 months.""

The company plans to initiate its pivotal study in the first half of 2026, with LX2006 having received Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Treatment with LX2006 has been generally well tolerated with no Grade 3+ serious adverse events to date across 17 participants.

Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANIX)has completed thefinal patient visitin its Phase 1 breast cancer vaccine clinical trial, marking a major milestone in the first-in-human evaluation of this novel vaccine invented atCleveland Clinic. The trial enrolled 35 women across three cohorts: 26 patients with triple-negative breast cancer at risk of recurrence, four in a prevention group with genetic mutations who elected preventive mastectomy, and five receiving the vaccine concurrently with pembrolizumab.

""While cancer vaccines have historically faced considerable challenges, our approach targets a novel antigen that has not been explored in this setting,"" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences. ""We believe this strategy could represent a new paradigm in immuno-oncology, with potential utility in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.""

Cleveland Clinicwill present full clinical results at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 11, 2025, following submission of the final study report to the U.S. Department of Defense and a Clinical Study Report to the FDA.

Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:TEM)subsidiaryAmbry Geneticshas announced anenhanced breast cancer risk assessmentsolution through its Ambry CARE Program that integrates breast density into the Tyrer-Cuzick scoring model within electronic health records. The enhancement addresses a critical gap in breast cancer screening, as 93% of women with elevated risk who qualify for breast MRI based on medical and family history never receive one, with the updated tool providing four Tyrer-Cuzick score options aligned with BI-RADS breast density categories to guide screening decisions.

""Accurately assessing breast cancer risk is key to improving outcomes, but important factors like breast density often get overlooked,"" said Tom Schoenherr, CEO ofAmbry Genetics. ""By bringing together Tyrer-Cuzick scoring and breast density right in the EHR, CARE shows how Ambry is making it easier for providers to get actionable insights within their workflow, ultimately helping patients get the care they need.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated that CARE interprets NCCN Guidelines with 99.5% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability as a trusted digital risk assessment tool for clinicians and patients.

Citius Oncology, Inc.

LYMPHIR, approved by the FDA in August 2024 for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy, targets an initial U.S. market that management estimates exceeds $400 million and continues to grow.

""As we prepare to launch LYMPHIR in the U.S., expanding access to international markets through Named Patient Programs is both a patient-driven mission and a strategic opportunity for Citius Oncology,"" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO ofCitius OncologyandCitius Pharmaceuticals. ""These programs allow us to serve patients who urgently need new treatment options, while also giving physicians valuable firsthand experience with LYMPHIR. Our recently signed exclusive distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. further strengthens this effort, establishing a trusted partner to help us bring LYMPHIR to patients across Southern Europe and the Balkans.""

The company is in active discussions with multiple prospective distribution partners across several European Union member states, South America, and select Middle Eastern territories, reflecting its commitment to positioning LYMPHIR for growth in key markets outside the United States. Named Patient Programs provide formally recognized pathways for physicians to request promising therapies on behalf of individual patients when no adequate approved alternatives exist, bridging the gap between clinical trial completion and broad market introduction while LYMPHIR remains available only through country-specific programs where permitted by local law.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence. Multiple blood tests from thefirst fourpatients showed measurable increases in natural killer cell activity and expansion, and the first patient in Cohort 3 has shown promising evidence of immune activation consistent with levels of activity observed in patients from the previous two lower-dose cohorts. This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7.

This suggests the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do—wake up the immune system and direct it against cancer.

The Phase 1 protocol allows evaluation of GTB-3650 in up to approximately 14 patients, with two patients in each of seven cohorts and doses ranging from 1.25μg/kg/day in Cohort 1 to 100μg/kg/day in Cohort 7. The trial will continue to dose-escalate into the higher ranges anticipated to be necessary to translate heightened immune activation into clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic activity.

""We are pleased with the enrollment momentum in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating GTB-3650 in cancer patients, which continues to advance on schedule,"" said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and CEO ofGT Biopharma. ""Moving into the third dose cohort after a successful safety review and encouraging early evidence of immunological activity, mark important steps forward in the development of GTB-3650. We look forward to sharing more data later this year to reinforce the ability of our TriKE constructs to activate endogenous NK cells, and the potential for broader utility with other targets to treat solid tumors (GTB-5550) and autoimmune indications (GTB-7550).""

Beyond blood cancers,GT Biopharmahas a second drug candidate moving toward the clinic. GTB-5550 targets a protein called B7H3 that appears in many different types of solid tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, and prostate cancers. The company expects tosubmit itsapplication to start human testing of GTB-5550 during the fourth quarter of this year. Unlike many cancer immunotherapies that require lengthy hospital infusions, GTB-5550 is being developed as a simple injection that patients could potentially give themselves at home, similar to insulin shots.

Both drug candidates are built onGT Biopharma'sproprietary TriKE platform, which uses specialized antibody fragments originally discovered in camels and llamas. These molecules are smaller and more stable than traditional antibodies, allowing them to work more effectively.GT Biopharmaholds an exclusive worldwide license from theUniversity of Minnesotato develop and commercialize therapies using this technology.

As of June 30, 2025,GT Biopharmareported cashand cash equivalents of approximately $5.3 million, which management expected would fund operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXEO)has achievedsignificant progresswith the FDA regarding its LX2006 gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia cardiomyopathy, with the agency indicating openness to pooling Phase I/II data with pivotal study data to support an accelerated approval pathway. Interim clinical data showed participants with abnormal left ventricular mass index achieved an 18% mean reduction at 6 months and 23% mean reduction at 12 months, exceeding the FDA-aligned 10% threshold, while more than 70% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures.

""We are encouraged by our recent dialogue with the FDA on LX2006, and we appreciate the Agency's collaborative spirit as we work to deliver a potentially life-changing therapy to the FA community as efficiently as possible,"" said R. Nolan Townsend, CEO ofLexeo Therapeutics. ""Given the highly compelling data to date that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements across both cardiac and neurologic measures of FA, we are now pursuing a development strategy that could enable a smaller pivotal study, given the potential to pool data with the ongoing Phase I/II trials, as well as potentially assessing the co-primary endpoint of LVMI earlier than 12 months.""

The company plans to initiate its pivotal study in the first half of 2026, with LX2006 having received Breakthrough Therapy, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA. Treatment with LX2006 has been generally well tolerated with no Grade 3+ serious adverse events to date across 17 participants.

Anixa Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANIX)has completed thefinal patient visitin its Phase 1 breast cancer vaccine clinical trial, marking a major milestone in the first-in-human evaluation of this novel vaccine invented atCleveland Clinic. The trial enrolled 35 women across three cohorts: 26 patients with triple-negative breast cancer at risk of recurrence, four in a prevention group with genetic mutations who elected preventive mastectomy, and five receiving the vaccine concurrently with pembrolizumab.

""While cancer vaccines have historically faced considerable challenges, our approach targets a novel antigen that has not been explored in this setting,"" said Dr. Amit Kumar, Chairman and CEO ofAnixa Biosciences. ""We believe this strategy could represent a new paradigm in immuno-oncology, with potential utility in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.""

Cleveland Clinicwill present full clinical results at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 11, 2025, following submission of the final study report to the U.S. Department of Defense and a Clinical Study Report to the FDA.

Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:TEM)subsidiaryAmbry Geneticshas announced anenhanced breast cancer risk assessmentsolution through its Ambry CARE Program that integrates breast density into the Tyrer-Cuzick scoring model within electronic health records. The enhancement addresses a critical gap in breast cancer screening, as 93% of women with elevated risk who qualify for breast MRI based on medical and family history never receive one, with the updated tool providing four Tyrer-Cuzick score options aligned with BI-RADS breast density categories to guide screening decisions.

""Accurately assessing breast cancer risk is key to improving outcomes, but important factors like breast density often get overlooked,"" said Tom Schoenherr, CEO ofAmbry Genetics. ""By bringing together Tyrer-Cuzick scoring and breast density right in the EHR, CARE shows how Ambry is making it easier for providers to get actionable insights within their workflow, ultimately helping patients get the care they need.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network demonstrated that CARE interprets NCCN Guidelines with 99.5% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability as a trusted digital risk assessment tool for clinicians and patients.

Citius Oncology, Inc.

LYMPHIR, approved by the FDA in August 2024 for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after at least one prior systemic therapy, targets an initial U.S. market that management estimates exceeds $400 million and continues to grow.

""As we prepare to launch LYMPHIR in the U.S., expanding access to international markets through Named Patient Programs is both a patient-driven mission and a strategic opportunity for Citius Oncology,"" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO ofCitius OncologyandCitius Pharmaceuticals. ""These programs allow us to serve patients who urgently need new treatment options, while also giving physicians valuable firsthand experience with LYMPHIR. Our recently signed exclusive distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. further strengthens this effort, establishing a trusted partner to help us bring LYMPHIR to patients across Southern Europe and the Balkans.""

The company is in active discussions with multiple prospective distribution partners across several European Union member states, South America, and select Middle Eastern territories, reflecting its commitment to positioning LYMPHIR for growth in key markets outside the United States. Named Patient Programs provide formally recognized pathways for physicians to request promising therapies on behalf of individual patients when no adequate approved alternatives exist, bridging the gap between clinical trial completion and broad market introduction while LYMPHIR remains available only through country-specific programs where permitted by local law.

These breakthroughs are propelling the global cancer treatment market from $282 billion in 2025 toward $643.5 billion by 2034[3], creating powerful momentum for companies pioneering next-generation approaches includingGT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP),Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:LXEO),Anixa Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:ANIX),Tempus AI, Inc.(NASDAQ:TEM), andCitius Oncology, Inc.(NASDAQ:CTOR).

Cancer immunotherapy spending alone is forecast to double from $58 billion in 2024 to $120 billion by 2030, according toMordor Intelligence[4], while over 120 clinical trials are testing RNA-based cancer vaccines that have already reduced melanoma recurrence by 44%[5].

GT Biopharma, Inc.(NASDAQ:GTBP) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company making significant progress in its fight against difficult-to-treat cancers. The San Francisco-based biotech announced today that both patients in Cohort 3 of its Phase 1 trial testing GTB-3650 have successfully initiated treatment with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities or safety concerns to date. The company is now well on track with enrollment and plans to begin dosing patients in Cohort 4 by year-end 2025, with additional data updates anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

The Phase 1 trial is testing GTB-3650 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-expressing blood cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These are patients whose cancers have come back or never responded to standard therapies. The drug works by activating the body's own natural killer cells to attack cancer cells. Patients receive the treatment through continuous infusions in two-week cycles, alternating two weeks on and two weeks off, for up to four months based on how well they're responding.

Recently, the company successfullymoved intoCohort 3 after formal safety reviews of the first two patient groups showed no safety or tolerability problems. What makes the early data particularly interesting is the biomarker evidence.

FREMONT, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- For small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), outdated systems are becoming a quiet but serious liability. According to the new data fromASUS, global technology leader that provides the world's most innovative and intuitive devices, over a third of SMB owners struggle to keep devices up to date. And with critical operating systems like Windows 10 approaching end-of-support, where many existing devices will be ineligible for upgrade, the risk of falling behind is rising fast.

""In today's threat landscape, modern protection starts with both modern systems and hardware,"" said Benjamin Yeh, ASUS Computer International President. ""And for small business, that begins with staying current, which is especially relevant as the end of Windows 10 will soon be here, leaving many exposed to vulnerabilities and operational disruption.""

""In today's threat landscape, modern protection starts with both modern systems and hardware,"" said Benjamin Yeh, ASUS Computer International President. ""And for small business, that begins with staying current, which is especially relevant as the end of Windows 10 will soon be here, leaving many exposed to vulnerabilities and operational disruption.""

The ASUS survey, which tracked responses from over 100 SMB leaders across the United States, revealed a dangerous gap between awareness and action. While 9 in 10 SMB leaders say IT is more essential today than it was a decade ago, that awareness isn't always reflected in action. Fewer than 40% (35%) describe themselves as very proactive about updating systems. The rest either delay updates, apply them inconsistently, or struggle to prioritize them, especially without dedicated IT teams.

This gap between intent and execution is what makes outdated software and hardware so dangerous. Without regular patches and upgrades, businesses are left exposed to evolving security threats, compliance risks, and performance issues.

For many SMBs, the problem isn't technical, it's operational. About 64% of leaders agree that without an active IT team, system updates are more likely to slip through the cracks. And for lean teams already stretched thin, that means security gaps can widen quickly.

To help SMBs address this challenge, ASUS offers AI-powered PCs such as theASUS ExpertBook P Serieswith ASUS ExpertGuardian, which delivers performance features like automated updates, smart diagnostics, and embedded security features that run quietly in the background. These advanced tools help SMBs stay protected and up to date without adding complexity.

With Windows 10 support ending, SMBs that delay upgrading down the line will face Cybersecurity risks from unpatched vulnerabilities, compliance penalties for those in regulated industries, and even operational disruptions from system failures.

ASUS AI PCs provide a straightforward way for SMBs to stay current and protected, while boosting their productivity at the same time.

With its team of 5,000 in-house R&D experts, the company is world-renowned for continuously reimagining today's technologies.

NEW YORK,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Land O'Lakes Inc., one of America's premier agribusiness companies and farmer-owned cooperatives, is teaming up withGetty Images(NYSE:GETY), a preeminent global visual content creator and marketplace, to launchRepicturing Rural, a playbook offering both content and perspectives that brands and media can use to tell more authentic, elevated stories about rural America.

This launch is tied to Land O'Lakes' Modern Rural Collective (MRC) efforts, which is a network of storytellers, marketers and brands working to inspire a new narrative for both urban and rural communities rooted in mutual aspiration and authentic representation.

Getty Images' global insights platform,VisualGPS, reveals surging demand for visuals of rural America, with customer searches for this content up 22% in 2024 and 8% to-date in 2025. Yet accurate representation of these communities falls short, with 2 out of 3 Americans in rural communities say advertisers simply don't understand them1.

""In the United States, visuals depicting rural communities have long been oversimplified, or are simply inaccurate. When it comes to advertising and marketing, the visuals that do focus on rural places oftentimes do not represent the complexity and diversity inherent to these communities,"" saidTristen Norman, Head of Creative for the Americas at Getty Images.""Through this initiative, we are empowering those people who shape our visual culture – media outlets, publishers, brands and ad agencies- to use visuals that reflect the richness of rural life today in ways that paint a more accurate picture while meaningfully connecting with communities across the country.""

Alongside the playbook, Getty Images and Land O'Lakes Inc. have developed a dedicated library of visuals to support media outlets, publishers, brands and ad agencies in more accurately representing rural communities. Comprised of imagery and video from Getty Images' creative collection, alongside newly commissioned images viaGetty Images Custom Content, the library is designed to fill representation gaps highlighted by VisualGPS research.

""As one of the largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the U.S., telling authentic rural stories has always been core to who we are and was the impetus for convening the Modern Rural Collective – to help others do the same,"" saidHeather Malenshek, Senior Vice President & Chief Marketing Officer of Land O'Lakes, Inc.""That's why we're excited about this work with Getty Images to launch Repicturing Rural — a concrete, actionable playbook that gives the tools necessary to tell more authentic, modern stories that reflect the true value of rural communities and the role they play in shaping our shared future.""

The playbook and curated visuals dive into themes often oversimplified or overlooked, including the rural demographics, workplaces, healthcare, education, everyday family life, and even the livestock and landscapes that shape these communities. It challenges media outlets, publishers, brands and marketing agencies to ditch outdated stereotypes and capture the vibrancy of rural life.

Through tools and collaboration with organizations like Getty Images, MRC is helping to shape the portrayal of rural America, reflecting both its value and values.

NEW YORK,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Land O'Lakes Inc., one of America's premier agribusiness companies and farmer-owned cooperatives, is teaming up withGetty Images(NYSE:GETY), a preeminent global visual content creator and marketplace, to launchRepicturing Rural, a playbook offering both content and perspectives that brands and media can use to tell more authentic, elevated stories about rural America.

This launch is tied to Land O'Lakes' Modern Rural Collective (MRC) efforts, which is a network of storytellers, marketers and brands working to inspire a new narrative for both urban and rural communities rooted in mutual aspiration and authentic representation.

Getty Images' global insights platform,VisualGPS, reveals surging demand for visuals of rural America, with customer searches for this content up 22% in 2024 and 8% to-date in 2025. Yet accurate representation of these communities falls short, with 2 out of 3 Americans in rural communities say advertisers simply don't understand them1.

""In the United States, visuals depicting rural communities have long been oversimplified, or are simply inaccurate. When it comes to advertising and marketing, the visuals that do focus on rural places oftentimes do not represent the complexity and diversity inherent to these communities,"" saidTristen Norman, Head of Creative for the Americas at Getty Images.""Through this initiative, we are empowering those people who shape our visual culture – media outlets, publishers, brands and ad agencies- to use visuals that reflect the richness of rural life today in ways that paint a more accurate picture while meaningfully connecting with communities across the country.""

Alongside the playbook, Getty Images and Land O'Lakes Inc. have developed a dedicated library of visuals to support media outlets, publishers, brands and ad agencies in more accurately representing rural communities. Comprised of imagery and video from Getty Images' creative collection, alongside newly commissioned images viaGetty Images Custom Content, the library is designed to fill representation gaps highlighted by VisualGPS research.

""As one of the largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the U.S., telling authentic rural stories has always been core to who we are and was the impetus for convening the Modern Rural Collective – to help others do the same,"" saidHeather Malenshek, Senior Vice President & Chief Marketing Officer of Land O'Lakes, Inc.""That's why we're excited about this work with Getty Images to launch Repicturing Rural — a concrete, actionable playbook that gives the tools necessary to tell more authentic, modern stories that reflect the true value of rural communities and the role they play in shaping our shared future.""

The playbook and curated visuals dive into themes often oversimplified or overlooked, including the rural demographics, workplaces, healthcare, education, everyday family life, and even the livestock and landscapes that shape these communities. It challenges media outlets, publishers, brands and marketing agencies to ditch outdated stereotypes and capture the vibrancy of rural life.

Through tools and collaboration with organizations like Getty Images, MRC is helping to shape the portrayal of rural America, reflecting both its value and values.

Adversaries are using AI to move faster and hide better. OpenText Core Threat Detection and Response extends Microsoft Copilot for Security with behavior-based indicators and identity context from continuous endpoint and user analysis—yielding more relevant summaries, guided investigations, and recommended actions so analysts can quickly move from signal to response with higher confidence

OpenText Core Threat Detection and Response is a foundational element of the next-generation OpenText Cybersecurity Cloud. Now fully integrated with Microsoft security tools—including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Entra ID, and Microsoft Security Copilot— the solution is designed to help organizations with comprehensive visibility, identity-centric protection, accelerated detection, and coordinated enterprise-wide response.

""With OpenText Core Threat Detection and Response, we're simplifying security while delivering stronger protection against insider threats and sophisticated, hard-to-detect attacks,"" said Muhi Majzoub, OpenText EVP, Security Products. ""Powered by AI and built with deep integration into Microsoft security tools, OpenText Core Threat Detection and Response filters out the noise and surfaces the most relevant, high-confidence threats— including those that often go unnoticed.

PITTSBURGH,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Sumitomo Riko is implementingAnsys, part of Synopsys, Inc.(NASDAQ:SNPS) AI technology to accelerate time-to-solution and improve efficiency during the design and manufacturing of automotive components. SimAI rapidly analyzes new or legacy simulation data to generate high-fidelity AI models capable of quickly predicting performance. Sumitomo Riko is using SimAI to accelerate computation-heavy tasks like anti-vibration design and exploration, battery cooling, magnetic field analysis, and mixing heat transfer analysis.

Sumitomo Riko is a leading global manufacturer of high-performance rubber automotive components. To ensure a safe and smooth ride, engineers must understand how the various components within the system behave under extreme loads and stressors. This requires running hundreds of multiphysics simulations where pre-processing tasks, like defining geometric parameters for the model, require extensive time and simulation expertise.

To accelerate product development, Sumitomo Riko is using SimAI and previously generated data to train AI models of high-performance rubber products, such as vibration isolators and hoses, without having to parametrize the geometry. This approach delivers AI models capable of making performance predictions under five minutes — over one hour of time savings for each new design — with accuracy comparable to high-fidelity simulation.

For example, initial testing revealed that SimAI could accelerate simulation cycles over 10x when predicting the mechanical performance of certain rubber bushes — components that play a key role in reducing shock and vibration within suspension systems. This significant speedup enables faster design iterations and more efficient workflows.

""To remain at the forefront of polymer and comprehensive evaluation technology innovation, we are working to implement workflow automation capabilities across the entire product lifecycle"" said Noritaka Matsuoka, head of analysis and experiment division, advanced systems R&D Center at Sumitomo Riko. ""The first challenge is to promote the adoption of AI across our product development cycles. SimAI is an ideal platform to start this journey due to its robust capabilities that eliminate the need for parametrized geometries, making it easier for multiple teams to collaborate on one project.""

Sumitomo Riko is also working with Ansys to implement workflow automation capabilities across product design, manufacturing, and retirement processes.

""Modern product development begins with quality data and leading simulation solutions,"" said Walt Hearn, senior vice president of worldwide sales and customer excellence at Ansys, part of Synopsys. ""One of the biggest challenges in R&D is balancing speed and accuracy during the early design phase. Ansys AI capabilities enable lightning-fast predictions, regardless of how large or complex the computation is, so that customers can make data-driven decisions before prototyping begins.""

WILMINGTON, Del.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- DuPont (NYSE:DD) announced the winners of its global awards program, theTyvek®Sustainable Healthcare Packaging Awards, during the Medical Packaging Conference (MPC) hosted by DuPont October 6-8, 2025. This annual awards program recognizes leaders across the healthcare industry who are embracing and driving sustainability throughout the packaging lifecycle.

The three 2025 winners, who utilize healthcare packaging made with DuPont™ Tyvek®material and whose efforts show a significant focus on sustainability, are:

Packaging (re)design: EvercareEvercare developed the Endurance R50 film, a medical-grade packaging solution that incorporates up to 50% post-consumer advanced recycling technology supplied by sister company Selenis, while maintaining the performance and safety of virgin materials. When combined with Tyvek®lidding, the film provides superior thermoforming, sealing and sterilization resistance. This innovation helps reduce reliance on virgin fossil-fuel-based plastics, lowers carbon emissions and supports the healthcare industry's move toward circularity.

Operational efficiencies: AmcorAmcor created ACT2100™, a next-generation Tyvek®heat seal coating that delivers 25% stronger seals and 50% greater breathability than comparable products. These advances enable faster, more reliable sterilization cycles and improve packaging integrity under demanding conditions. With consistent application and fiber-free peels, ACT2100™ enhances user experience, reduces manufacturing risks and ensures supply chain reliability across multiple global sites.

Sustainability in-use: B. Braun Medical, Inc.B. Braun redesigned its regional anesthesia and procedure tray packaging to significantly reduce both plastic and paper use. By pairingAmcor's SureformUltra forming film withTyvek®1059Brollstock, the new sterile barrier system eliminates 64 metric tons of plastic and 4,400 pounds of paper annually. The change also lowers CO₂e emissions by 198 metric tons each year and makes packaging easier for hospitals to recycle—advancing B. Braun's global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030.

""The award-winning initiatives showcased in the 2025 DuPont™ Tyvek®Sustainable Healthcare Packaging Awards are a true testament to how the healthcare packaging industry continues to make meaningful strides in sustainable innovation,"" said David Domnisch, vice president and general manager, DuPont™ Tyvek®& Typar®. ""DuPont is proud to partner with customers in the healthcare and healthcare packaging industry to help them meet and exceed their sustainability goals while continuing to provide the highest level of product and patient safety.""

TheTyvek®Sustainable Healthcare Packaging Awardsprogram further supports the Tyvek®Healthcare Packaging team's work to help advance DuPont's global strategy of enabling a circular economy and working with global supply chains to reduce Scope 3 emissions. The program is open to any medical device and/or pharmaceutical manufacturer, sterile packaging manufacturer, healthcare facility, university, material recovery facility, or other healthcare company focused on sustainable packaging made with DuPont™ Tyvek®material. The next application period is expected to open in May 2026.

WILMINGTON, Del.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- DuPont (NYSE:DD) announced the winners of its global awards program, theTyvek®Sustainable Healthcare Packaging Awards, during the Medical Packaging Conference (MPC) hosted by DuPont October 6-8, 2025. This annual awards program recognizes leaders across the healthcare industry who are embracing and driving sustainability throughout the packaging lifecycle.

The three 2025 winners, who utilize healthcare packaging made with DuPont™ Tyvek®material and whose efforts show a significant focus on sustainability, are:

Packaging (re)design: EvercareEvercare developed the Endurance R50 film, a medical-grade packaging solution that incorporates up to 50% post-consumer advanced recycling technology supplied by sister company Selenis, while maintaining the performance and safety of virgin materials. When combined with Tyvek®lidding, the film provides superior thermoforming, sealing and sterilization resistance. This innovation helps reduce reliance on virgin fossil-fuel-based plastics, lowers carbon emissions and supports the healthcare industry's move toward circularity.

Operational efficiencies: AmcorAmcor created ACT2100™, a next-generation Tyvek®heat seal coating that delivers 25% stronger seals and 50% greater breathability than comparable products. These advances enable faster, more reliable sterilization cycles and improve packaging integrity under demanding conditions. With consistent application and fiber-free peels, ACT2100™ enhances user experience, reduces manufacturing risks and ensures supply chain reliability across multiple global sites.

Sustainability in-use: B. Braun Medical, Inc.B. Braun redesigned its regional anesthesia and procedure tray packaging to significantly reduce both plastic and paper use. By pairingAmcor's SureformUltra forming film withTyvek®1059Brollstock, the new sterile barrier system eliminates 64 metric tons of plastic and 4,400 pounds of paper annually. The change also lowers CO₂e emissions by 198 metric tons each year and makes packaging easier for hospitals to recycle—advancing B. Braun's global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030.

""The award-winning initiatives showcased in the 2025 DuPont™ Tyvek®Sustainable Healthcare Packaging Awards are a true testament to how the healthcare packaging industry continues to make meaningful strides in sustainable innovation,"" said David Domnisch, vice president and general manager, DuPont™ Tyvek®& Typar®. ""DuPont is proud to partner with customers in the healthcare and healthcare packaging industry to help them meet and exceed their sustainability goals while continuing to provide the highest level of product and patient safety.""

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

In many of the world's data centers, AI workloads are stretching power and space limitations. Hyperscalers can't scale-up (add more capacity into each individual system) or scale-out (connect multiple systems within a data center) any further. This dynamic puts increasing demand on data center interconnects, as the industry must ""scale-across"" by distributing AI workloads across multiple data centers. Without addressing the connection points between data centers, organizations could face performance challenges, capacity bottlenecks and suboptimal processing that wastes time, power and money. The Cisco 8223 system gives organizations the flexibility and programmability necessary to build these networks, with deep buffering to provide the cross-site security and reliability necessary for crucial workloads.

Power Efficient. Scalable. Programmable. Secure.Building a future-ready backbone AI network today is essential – one that can meet the power consumption challenges while remaining scalable, flexible and secure. The Cisco 8223 provides customers the capacity to handle surging workloads, the necessary flexibility with fully programmability, and the power efficiency to directly address power consumption challenges.

Flexibility – An AI 'Must Have'The demands of AI networking aren't simply growing, but are also constantly changing and evolving. Organizations demand infrastructure that is agile enough to change as business requirements do, and are seeking flexibility in deployment models so they can build networks for their exact needs. The Cisco 8223 will initially be available for open-source SONiC deployments, withIOS XRon the horizon.

In addition to its availability in the fixed 8223 system, the P200 silicon itself will be deployable in modular platforms and disaggregated chassis, offering customers architectural consistency for any size network. TheCisco Nexusportfolio will also support systems running NX-OS based on the P200 in the near future. Cisco is delivering the agility and operational flexibility required for today's AI infrastructure.

SAN JOSE, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Today, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) unveiled the Cisco 8223, the industry's most optimized routing system for efficiently and securely connecting data centers and powering the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. As AI adoption accelerates, data centers face soaring demand, rising power constraints, and evolving security threats. The Cisco 8223 rises to the challenge as the only 51.2 terabits per second (Tbps) Ethernet fixed router built for the intense traffic of AI workloads between data centers.  Cisco today also announced its latestSilicon Oneinnovation – the P200 chip – which sits at the core of the 8223. Together, these innovations empower organizations to shatter bottlenecks and future-proof their infrastructure for the AI era.

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

In many of the world's data centers, AI workloads are stretching power and space limitations. Hyperscalers can't scale-up (add more capacity into each individual system) or scale-out (connect multiple systems within a data center) any further. This dynamic puts increasing demand on data center interconnects, as the industry must ""scale-across"" by distributing AI workloads across multiple data centers. Without addressing the connection points between data centers, organizations could face performance challenges, capacity bottlenecks and suboptimal processing that wastes time, power and money. The Cisco 8223 system gives organizations the flexibility and programmability necessary to build these networks, with deep buffering to provide the cross-site security and reliability necessary for crucial workloads.

Power Efficient. Scalable. Programmable. Secure.Building a future-ready backbone AI network today is essential – one that can meet the power consumption challenges while remaining scalable, flexible and secure. The Cisco 8223 provides customers the capacity to handle surging workloads, the necessary flexibility with fully programmability, and the power efficiency to directly address power consumption challenges.

Flexibility – An AI 'Must Have'The demands of AI networking aren't simply growing, but are also constantly changing and evolving. Organizations demand infrastructure that is agile enough to change as business requirements do, and are seeking flexibility in deployment models so they can build networks for their exact needs. The Cisco 8223 will initially be available for open-source SONiC deployments, withIOS XRon the horizon.

In addition to its availability in the fixed 8223 system, the P200 silicon itself will be deployable in modular platforms and disaggregated chassis, offering customers architectural consistency for any size network. TheCisco Nexusportfolio will also support systems running NX-OS based on the P200 in the near future. Cisco is delivering the agility and operational flexibility required for today's AI infrastructure.

Cisco Silicon One: The Industry's Most Scalable and Programmable Unified Networking ArchitectureCisco Silicon One is a complete portfolio of networking devices across AI, hyperscaler, data center, enterprise and service provider use cases. Introduced in 2019, Cisco Silicon One is playing critical roles in major networks around the world.

Industry Reaction""The increasing scale of the cloud and AI requires faster networks with more buffering to absorb bursts.  We're pleased to see the P200 providing innovation and more options in this space.  Microsoft was an early adopter of Silicon One, and the common ASIC architecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.""- Dave Maltz, Technical Fellow and Corporate Vice President, Azure Networking, Microsoft

""As Alibaba continues to invest in and expand the cloud infrastructure, DCI is a critical pillar of our strategy. We are pleased to see the launch of Cisco Silicon One P200, the industry's first 51.2T routing ASIC that delivers high bandwidth, lower power consumption, and full P4 programmability. This breakthrough chip aligns perfectly with the evolution of Alibaba's eCore architecture. We plan to leverage the P200 to build a single chip platform, serving as a foundational building block for expanding our eCore deployment. Beyond supporting our Cisco Silicon One Q200 deployment scenarios, this new routing chip will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices. This transition will significantly enhance the stability, reliability, and scalability of our DCI network while keeping the simplicity. In addition, we are developing and exploring innovative disaggregated architectures using Cisco G200 for our high-performance datacenter network.

SAN JOSE, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Today, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) unveiled the Cisco 8223, the industry's most optimized routing system for efficiently and securely connecting data centers and powering the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. As AI adoption accelerates, data centers face soaring demand, rising power constraints, and evolving security threats. The Cisco 8223 rises to the challenge as the only 51.2 terabits per second (Tbps) Ethernet fixed router built for the intense traffic of AI workloads between data centers.  Cisco today also announced its latestSilicon Oneinnovation – the P200 chip – which sits at the core of the 8223. Together, these innovations empower organizations to shatter bottlenecks and future-proof their infrastructure for the AI era.

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

In many of the world's data centers, AI workloads are stretching power and space limitations. Hyperscalers can't scale-up (add more capacity into each individual system) or scale-out (connect multiple systems within a data center) any further. This dynamic puts increasing demand on data center interconnects, as the industry must ""scale-across"" by distributing AI workloads across multiple data centers. Without addressing the connection points between data centers, organizations could face performance challenges, capacity bottlenecks and suboptimal processing that wastes time, power and money. The Cisco 8223 system gives organizations the flexibility and programmability necessary to build these networks, with deep buffering to provide the cross-site security and reliability necessary for crucial workloads.

Power Efficient. Scalable. Programmable. Secure.Building a future-ready backbone AI network today is essential – one that can meet the power consumption challenges while remaining scalable, flexible and secure. The Cisco 8223 provides customers the capacity to handle surging workloads, the necessary flexibility with fully programmability, and the power efficiency to directly address power consumption challenges.

Flexibility – An AI 'Must Have'The demands of AI networking aren't simply growing, but are also constantly changing and evolving. Organizations demand infrastructure that is agile enough to change as business requirements do, and are seeking flexibility in deployment models so they can build networks for their exact needs. The Cisco 8223 will initially be available for open-source SONiC deployments, withIOS XRon the horizon.

In addition to its availability in the fixed 8223 system, the P200 silicon itself will be deployable in modular platforms and disaggregated chassis, offering customers architectural consistency for any size network. TheCisco Nexusportfolio will also support systems running NX-OS based on the P200 in the near future. Cisco is delivering the agility and operational flexibility required for today's AI infrastructure.

Cisco Silicon One: The Industry's Most Scalable and Programmable Unified Networking ArchitectureCisco Silicon One is a complete portfolio of networking devices across AI, hyperscaler, data center, enterprise and service provider use cases. Introduced in 2019, Cisco Silicon One is playing critical roles in major networks around the world.

Industry Reaction""The increasing scale of the cloud and AI requires faster networks with more buffering to absorb bursts.  We're pleased to see the P200 providing innovation and more options in this space.  Microsoft was an early adopter of Silicon One, and the commonASICarchitecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.""- Dave Maltz, Technical Fellow and Corporate Vice President, Azure Networking, Microsoft

""As Alibaba continues to invest in and expand the cloud infrastructure, DCI is a critical pillar of our strategy. We are pleased to see the launch of Cisco Silicon One P200, the industry's first 51.2T routingASICthat delivers high bandwidth, lower power consumption, and full P4 programmability. This breakthrough chip aligns perfectly with the evolution of Alibaba's eCore architecture. We plan to leverage the P200 to build a single chip platform, serving as a foundational building block for expanding our eCore deployment. Beyond supporting our Cisco Silicon One Q200 deployment scenarios, this new routing chip will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices. This transition will significantly enhance the stability, reliability, and scalability of our DCI network while keeping the simplicity. In addition, we are developing and exploring innovative disaggregated architectures using Cisco G200 for our high-performance datacenter network. The introduction of this advanced routing chip marks a pivotal step forward, empowering Alibaba to accelerate innovation and drive infrastructure expansion in the AI era.""-Dennis Cai, Vice President, Head of Network Infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud

""AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data center, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centers hundreds of miles apart,"" said Martin Lund, EVP, Cisco's Common Hardware Group. ""With the Cisco 8223, powered by the new Cisco Silicon One P200, we're delivering the massive bandwidth, scale and security needed for distributed data center architectures.""

In many of the world's data centers, AI workloads are stretching power and space limitations. Hyperscalers can't scale-up (add more capacity into each individual system) or scale-out (connect multiple systems within a data center) any further. This dynamic puts increasing demand on data center interconnects, as the industry must ""scale-across"" by distributing AI workloads across multiple data centers. Without addressing the connection points between data centers, organizations could face performance challenges, capacity bottlenecks and suboptimal processing that wastes time, power and money. The Cisco 8223 system gives organizations the flexibility and programmability necessary to build these networks, with deep buffering to provide the cross-site security and reliability necessary for crucial workloads.

Power Efficient. Scalable. Programmable. Secure.Building a future-ready backbone AI network today is essential – one that can meet the power consumption challenges while remaining scalable, flexible and secure. The Cisco 8223 provides customers the capacity to handle surging workloads, the necessary flexibility with fully programmability, and the power efficiency to directly address power consumption challenges.

Flexibility – An AI 'Must Have'The demands of AI networking aren't simply growing, but are also constantly changing and evolving. Organizations demand infrastructure that is agile enough to change as business requirements do, and are seeking flexibility in deployment models so they can build networks for their exact needs. The Cisco 8223 will initially be available for open-source SONiC deployments, withIOS XRon the horizon.

In addition to its availability in the fixed 8223 system, the P200 silicon itself will be deployable in modular platforms and disaggregated chassis, offering customers architectural consistency for any size network. TheCisco Nexusportfolio will also support systems running NX-OS based on the P200 in the near future. Cisco is delivering the agility and operational flexibility required for today's AI infrastructure.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Portland General Electric (PGE) and GridCARE successfully completed their first joint project to accelerate large load interconnections using flexibility for data centers in Hillsboro, Oregon. This will result in over 80 MW of incremental capacity available for data center load in 2026, part of a total of more than 400 MW that will be energized by 2029. The novel generative AI-forecasting methodology more efficiently uses existing grid infrastructure to meet growing electricity demand in key economic sectors.

Hillsboro is a major data center hub in the U.S., thanks to its access to a diverse energy mix, robust fiber connectivity, and temperate climate. These advantages have attracted a large number of data center projects with billions of dollars to invest. Meeting this demand requires innovative approaches that both accelerate load interconnections and safeguard affordability for all customers.

""Delivering safe, reliable electricity at the lowest possible cost are our core customer commitments,""said Larry Bekkedahl, SVP of Strategy and Advanced Energy Delivery, Portland General Electric.""By working with GridCARE, we've successfully implemented an AI-based approach that helps us serve fast-growing data center demand while keeping costs low and maintaining system reliability. This kind of beneficial electrification is a win for our customers, our communities, and Oregon's economy.""

""Delivering safe, reliable electricity at the lowest possible cost are our core customer commitments,""said Larry Bekkedahl, SVP of Strategy and Advanced Energy Delivery, Portland General Electric.""By working with GridCARE, we've successfully implemented an AI-based approach that helps us serve fast-growing data center demand while keeping costs low and maintaining system reliability. This kind of beneficial electrification is a win for our customers, our communities, and Oregon's economy.""

To identify and validate capacity on the existing system, PGE used GridCARE's patented DeFlex™ methodology, to apply generative AI forecasting, detailed hourly demand modeling, and grid flexibility solutions. By optimizing the use of flexible resources such as batteries and onsite generation, PGE is able to interconnect multiple data center customers years earlier than initially expected.

This breakthrough approach provides multiple benefits:

""The pace of AI and cloud growth demands new thinking about how we power the digital economy,""said Christian Belady, retired VP of Datacenter Advanced Development at Microsoft. ""What PGE and GridCARE have accomplished in Hillsboro is the kind of innovation that not only enables AI and cloud expansion — it unlocks billions in new investment and accelerates returns across the entire North American ecosystem.""

Nationally, electricity demand from data centers is projected to reach 6.7% to 12% of U.S. consumption by 2028, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Lab1. Utilities everywhere are grappling with how to deliver new capacity quickly while managing system costs and maintaining fair cost allocation for growth demand across customer classes.

GridCARE's platform helps utilities validate their planning, model flexibility at scale, and relieve interconnection queues. By doing so, it supports billions in new local and regional economic investment while reinforcing the utility's core mission of reliable and safe power delivery, while serving energy at the lowest cost possible.

This partnership strengthens Oregon's role as a national technology hub and also positions Portland General Electric as one of the first utilities to utilize AI for large-scale load forecasting to benefit the grid and customers.

""Utilities face a once-in-a-generation opportunity to meet exponential load growth,""said Amit Narayan, CEO of GridCARE.""By combining generative AI with grid flexibility, we help utilities like PGE move at the pace the AI economy requires. This project shows what's possible when utilities and innovators partner closely.""

Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss

There are no guarantees that dividend-paying stocks will continue to pay dividends. In addition, dividend-paying stocks may not experience the same capital appreciation potential as non-dividend-paying stocks.

The value of equity securities in the fund's portfolio will fluctuate and, as a result, the fund's share price may decline. Equity securities may decline in value because of an increase in interest rates or changes in the stock market.

The fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional instruments.

The fund is a new fund that recently commenced operations. New funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.

While stocks have higher return potential, they may be more volatile than bonds.

Writing option contracts can result in losses that exceed the seller's initial premium collected and may lead to additional turnover and higher tax liability.

ETFs are generally more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds due to their structure. When investors redeem shares, ETFs can do so in-kind, meaning they exchange shares for underlying assets without triggering capital gains taxes for remaining investors. ETFs often distribute fewer capital gains to investors compared to mutual funds, leading to lower tax liabilities.

As part of the fund's investment objective, the fund seeks to distribute current monthly income. As a result of market, interest rate and other circumstances, the amounts of such distributions may vary widely from month to month and in some months no distribution may be paid at all. There is no assurance that the fund will make a distribution in any given month. Distributions in excess of the fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital and a significant portion of the fund's distributions at any point in time may consist of return of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable currently but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those fund shares on which the distribution was received are sold.

ETF shares are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. However, shares may be redeemed at NAV directly by certain authorized broker-dealers (Authorized Participants) in very large creation/redemption units. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market price returns are based on the official closing price of an ETF share or, if the official closing price isn't available, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer (""NBBO"") as of the time the ETF calculates the current NAV per share. NAVs are calculated using prices as of the end of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 PM Eastern Time).

These closed-end funds are no longer available in initial public offerings and are only offered through broker-dealers on the secondary market. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. Shares of a fund may trade at either a premium or discount relative to the fund's net asset value, and there can be no assurance that any discount will decrease. The values of, and/or the income generated by, securities held by a fund may decline due to general market conditions or other factors, including those directly involving the issuers of such securities. Equity securities fluctuate in value in response to factors specific to the issuer of the security. Debt securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk, and high-yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality have a much greater risk of default and their values tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities with similar maturities. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with their large-cap counterparts. Each fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of the net asset value and the market price of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to hedge or closely track. There are numerous risks associated with transactions in options on securities.

Equity securities fluctuate in value in response to factors specific to the issuer of the security. Debt securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk, and high-yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality have a much greater risk of default and their values tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities with similar maturities. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with their large-cap counterparts. Each fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of the net asset value and the market price of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to hedge or closely track. There are numerous risks associated with transactions in options on securities.

These closed-end funds are no longer available in initial public offerings and are only offered through broker-dealers on the secondary market. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. Shares of a fund may trade at either a premium or discount relative to the fund's net asset value, and there can be no assurance that any discount will decrease. The values of, and/or the income generated by, securities held by a fund may decline due to general market conditions or other factors, including those directly involving the issuers of such securities. Equity securities fluctuate in value in response to factors specific to the issuer of the security. Debt securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk, and high-yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality have a much greater risk of default and their values tend to be more volatile than higher-rated securities with similar maturities. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with their large-cap counterparts. Each fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of the net asset value and the market price of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to hedge or closely track. There are numerous risks associated with transactions in options on securities.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Saxon Capital Group, Inc, SCGX (OTC) -- This winter, households across the country face a sharp surge in electricity heating costs, according to the latest update from theNational Energy Assistance Directors Association(NEADA). The average American family heating with electricity can expect to pay $1,205, up 10.2% from $1,093 last year—an increase that's more than twice the current inflation rate. Behind this hike are several factors: utilities investing heavily in new transmission and distribution systems, growing reliance on expensive natural gas for power generation, and an unprecedented boom in massive data centers that suck up more electricity each month.

Energy Glass™ simply replaces windows a home would naturally have, where solar panels are an add on costing substantially more than Energy Glass Solar windows.

Energy Glass Solar'spatented Energy Glass™ technology transforms ordinary windows into clear solar panels, silently converting sunlight into usable electricity all year. As more U.S. families struggle with heating bills boosted by inflation, transmission upgrades, and natural gas prices, innovations like these mean less monthly pain. Solar homes and Energy Glass™ energy-generating windows don't just help the environment—they pay off every winter by shrinking utility bills that would otherwise keep rising.

About Saxon Capital Group, Inc.Saxon Capital owns the Worldwide Exclusive Rights to produce and sell Energy Glass Solar™ Architectural Glass Products, A Patented, Electric Producing, Clear Architectural Solar Glass Technology that Creates Electricity from Solar, Diffused and Ambient Light.

About Solar Home BuildersSolar Home Builders designs and constructs residences powered by integrated solar technology. Using clear solar glass and energy-generating wall systems, the company delivers homes that produce renewable energy while maintaining modern aesthetics and comfort. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Solar Home Builders offers a range of housing solutions that combine environmental responsibility with long-term homeowner value.

About Energy Glass Solar™Energy Glass Solar™ is a patented, Optically Clear Vertical Building Photovoltaic Window System that produces continuous Energy from Sunlight, Diffused, Ambient Light and Ground Reflectance and has 100% field of vision. The entire surface of the windows is clear – No grids, dots or lines! This proprietary Inorganic Nano Technology and Solar Collector does not degrade from IR like typical solar cells do. DC electricity produced from Energy Glass Solar™ can be inverted and returned to the grid, charge batteries, be wired direct to DC electronics, and offers a value-added solution for power independence from the main electrical grid! Energy Glass Solar™ uses inorganic nano particles that are co-infused in a polycarbonate interlayer, which is then laminated between two lites of ¼"" inch glass. The nano particles redirect components of the light spectrum to the edge of the glass while letting most of the spectrum through. The light that reaches the edge of the glass is collected and sent to our patented edge frame collectors. Because our edge collectors are at the edge of our glass and actually fit inside of the photovoltaic curtain wall framing system, they are protected and do not suffer degradation from IR as typical solar cell installations do.

Using clear solar glass and energy-generating wall systems, the company delivers homes that produce renewable energy while maintaining modern aesthetics and comfort. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Solar Home Builders offers a range of housing solutions that combine environmental responsibility with long-term homeowner value.

About Energy Glass Solar™Energy Glass Solar™ is a patented, Optically Clear Vertical Building Photovoltaic Window System that produces continuous Energy from Sunlight, Diffused, Ambient Light and Ground Reflectance and has 100% field of vision. The entire surface of the windows is clear – No grids, dots or lines! This proprietary Inorganic Nano Technology and Solar Collector does not degrade from IR like typical solar cells do. DC electricity produced from Energy Glass Solar™ can be inverted and returned to the grid, charge batteries, be wired direct to DC electronics, and offers a value-added solution for power independence from the main electrical grid! Energy Glass Solar™ uses inorganic nano particles that are co-infused in a polycarbonate interlayer, which is then laminated between two lites of ¼"" inch glass. The nano particles redirect components of the light spectrum to the edge of the glass while letting most of the spectrum through. The light that reaches the edge of the glass is collected and sent to our patented edge frame collectors. Because our edge collectors are at the edge of our glass and actually fit inside of the photovoltaic curtain wall framing system, they are protected and do not suffer degradation from IR as typical solar cell installations do.

PLEASANTON, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Movano Health(Nasdaq:MOVE) announced today that it will implement a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its common stock (the ""Reverse Stock Split""), effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on October 10, 2025. The Company's common stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on Friday, October 10, 2025, and will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""MOVE."" The new CUSIP number for the common stock will be 62459M 305.

The Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the bid price of the common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stockholders authorized the reverse stock split at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on September 26, 2025, with the final ratio determined by the Company's Board of Directors.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of the Company's pre-split common stock issued and outstanding will be automatically reclassified into one new share of the Company's common stock. This will reduce the number of shares outstanding from approximately 8.3 million shares to approximately 0.8 million shares. The number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock will remain unchanged. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash in lieu of their fractional interests, after aggregating all the fractional interests of a holder resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. Proportionate adjustments will be made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company's equity plans and grants thereunder, as applicable. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the par value of the common stock.

The combination of, and reduction in, the shares of common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will occur automatically at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split without any additional action on the part of the Company's stockholders. The Company's transfer agent, Pacific Stock Transfer Company, is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split and will send stockholders of record holding their shares electronically in book-entry form a transaction notice indicating the number of shares of common stock held after the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee will have their positions adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to their broker, bank, or other nominee's particular processes, and are not expected to be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.

Additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company held on September 26, 2025, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 29, 2025, a copy of which is available atwww.sec.govand on the Company's website.

PLEASANTON, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Movano Health(Nasdaq:MOVE) announced today that it will implement a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its common stock (the ""Reverse Stock Split""), effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on October 10, 2025. The Company's common stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on Friday, October 10, 2025, and will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""MOVE."" The new CUSIP number for the common stock will be 62459M 305.

The Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the bid price of the common stock to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's stockholders authorized the reverse stock split at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on September 26, 2025, with the final ratio determined by the Company's Board of Directors.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of the Company's pre-split common stock issued and outstanding will be automatically reclassified into one new share of the Company's common stock. This will reduce the number of shares outstanding from approximately 8.3 million shares to approximately 0.8 million shares. The number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock will remain unchanged. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash in lieu of their fractional interests, after aggregating all the fractional interests of a holder resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. Proportionate adjustments will be made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the Company's equity plans and grants thereunder, as applicable. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the par value of the common stock.

The combination of, and reduction in, the shares of common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will occur automatically at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split without any additional action on the part of the Company's stockholders. The Company's transfer agent, Pacific Stock Transfer Company, is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split and will send stockholders of record holding their shares electronically in book-entry form a transaction notice indicating the number of shares of common stock held after the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee will have their positions adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to their broker, bank, or other nominee's particular processes, and are not expected to be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.

Additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company held on September 26, 2025, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 29, 2025, a copy of which is available atwww.sec.govand on the Company's website.

(""Needham"") (Nasdaq:NBBK), the holding company for Needham Bank, and Provident Bancorp, Inc. (""Provident"") (Nasdaq:PVBC), the holding company for BankProv, today announced that the election form and letter of transmittal (together with the related instructions, the ""Election Materials"") have been distributed to holders of Provident common stock so Provident stockholders may elect to receive either Needham common stock, cash or a combination of both upon the completion of the pending combination of Needham and Provident.

On June 5, 2025, Needham, Needham Bank, Provident, and BankProv entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Provident will merge with and into Needham, with Needham as the surviving entity (the ""Holdco Merger""), and, immediately thereafter, BankProv will merge with and into Needham Bank, with Needham Bank as the surviving entity (the ""Bank Merger"" and, together with the Holdco Merger, the ""Merger Transaction"").

On September 16, 2025, Provident announced that its stockholders had approved the Merger Agreement.

Needham anticipates that all required regulatory approvals will be received and all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied by November 14, 2025, and the Merger Transaction will become effective on November 15, 2025, although Needham cannot provide any assurance that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained, or whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals.

Stock and Cash Merger ConsiderationAs disclosed previously, including in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Needham with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on July 30, 2025 (the ""proxy statement/prospectus""), at the effective time of the Holdco Merger (the ""Effective Time""), shares of Provident common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each Provident stockholder, and subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, either:

The Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration are collectively referred to as the ""Merger Consideration."" The receipt of the Merger Consideration will be subject in each case to applicable withholding taxes, if any, and be payable without interest.

The allocation and proration provisions in the Merger Agreement ensure that 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Stock Consideration and 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Cash Consideration. (The allocation and proration procedures specified in the Merger Agreement are summarized in the Election Materials and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus.)

Needham and Provident intend to announce the definitive election deadline (the ""Election Deadline"") at least five business days (but not more than 15 business days) prior to the Election Deadline. Provident stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee should follow the instructions of such broker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to the procedures for making elections and exchanging their shares of Provident common stock.  For shares with respect to which a Provident stockholder has made an election as of the Election Deadline, those shares may not be traded through the Effective Time.

Any Provident stockholder who does not make a proper election by the Election Deadline will have their shares of Provident common stock exchanged for Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration or a combination of the two depending on the valid elections of other Provident stockholders and subject to the allocation and proration procedures in the Merger Agreement.  Provident ESOP and 401(k) plan participants who do not make a proper and timely election with respect to their indirect beneficial ownership of Provident common stock through the ESOP and/or 401(k) plans will have their shares elected by the respective plan trustee in proportion to the elections made by other plan participants, subject to the allocation and proration procedures in the Merger Agreement.

(""Needham"") (Nasdaq:NBBK), the holding company for Needham Bank, and Provident Bancorp, Inc. (""Provident"") (Nasdaq:PVBC), the holding company for BankProv, today announced that the election form and letter of transmittal (together with the related instructions, the ""Election Materials"") have been distributed to holders of Provident common stock so Provident stockholders may elect to receive either Needham common stock, cash or a combination of both upon the completion of the pending combination of Needham and Provident.

On June 5, 2025, Needham, Needham Bank, Provident, and BankProv entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Provident will merge with and into Needham, with Needham as the surviving entity (the ""Holdco Merger""), and, immediately thereafter, BankProv will merge with and into Needham Bank, with Needham Bank as the surviving entity (the ""Bank Merger"" and, together with the Holdco Merger, the ""Merger Transaction"").

On September 16, 2025, Provident announced that its stockholders had approved the Merger Agreement.

Needham anticipates that all required regulatory approvals will be received and all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied by November 14, 2025, and the Merger Transaction will become effective on November 15, 2025, although Needham cannot provide any assurance that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained, or whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals.

Stock and Cash Merger ConsiderationAs disclosed previously, including in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Needham with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on July 30, 2025 (the ""proxy statement/prospectus""), at the effective time of the Holdco Merger (the ""Effective Time""), shares of Provident common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each Provident stockholder, and subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, either:

Provident stockholders may also elect to receive a combination of Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration, subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement.

The Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration are collectively referred to as the ""Merger Consideration."" The receipt of the Merger Consideration will be subject in each case to applicable withholding taxes, if any, and be payable without interest.

The allocation and proration provisions in the Merger Agreement ensure that 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Stock Consideration and 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Cash Consideration. (The allocation and proration procedures specified in the Merger Agreement are summarized in the Election Materials and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus.)

Provident stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee should follow the instructions of such broker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to the procedures for making elections and exchanging their shares of Provident common stock.  For shares with respect to which a Provident stockholder has made an election as of the Election Deadline, those shares may not be traded through the Effective Time.

(""Needham"") (Nasdaq:NBBK), the holding company for Needham Bank, and Provident Bancorp, Inc. (""Provident"") (Nasdaq:PVBC), the holding company for BankProv, today announced that the election form and letter of transmittal (together with the related instructions, the ""Election Materials"") have been distributed to holders of Provident common stock so Provident stockholders may elect to receive either Needham common stock, cash or a combination of both upon the completion of the pending combination of Needham and Provident.

On June 5, 2025, Needham, Needham Bank, Provident, and BankProv entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Provident will merge with and into Needham, with Needham as the surviving entity (the ""Holdco Merger""), and, immediately thereafter, BankProv will merge with and into Needham Bank, with Needham Bank as the surviving entity (the ""Bank Merger"" and, together with the Holdco Merger, the ""Merger Transaction"").

On September 16, 2025, Provident announced that its stockholders had approved the Merger Agreement.

Needham anticipates that all required regulatory approvals will be received and all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied by November 14, 2025, and the Merger Transaction will become effective on November 15, 2025, although Needham cannot provide any assurance that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained, or whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals.

Stock and Cash Merger ConsiderationAs disclosed previously, including in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Needham with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on July 30, 2025 (the ""proxy statement/prospectus""), at the effective time of the Holdco Merger (the ""Effective Time""), shares of Provident common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each Provident stockholder, and subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, either:

Provident stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee should follow the instructions of such broker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to the procedures for making elections and exchanging their shares of Provident common stock.  For shares with respect to which a Provident stockholder has made an election as of the Election Deadline, those shares may not be traded through the Effective Time.

The partnership aims to establish a secure foundation for autonomous, real-time intelligence systems that operate on live mission data - without compromising security, confidentiality, or control.

The collaboration integrates VisionWave's advanced radar and AI-driven computer vision systems with PVML's secure, real-time data-AI infrastructure, connecting live defense data sources directly to active mission environments. This combination seeks to enable the development of an operational system powered by thousands of autonomous AI agents that plan missions, track execution, and respond dynamically to real-time deviations.

Early joint projects suggest that development cycles can be reduced by up to 70%, as VisionWave can now build trusted AI agents that securely connect to previously inaccessible data sources, thanks to a unified, secure, and infrastructure-agnostic foundation that preserves full control and confidentiality.

""This collaboration seeks to give VisionWave the foundation to redefine how intelligence operates,"" said Noam Kenig, Chief Executive Officer of VisionWave. ""Our goal is tobring trusted, autonomous systems to the center of mission execution - where every decision, in every moment, counts.""

The collaboration will progress through a series of joint initiatives beginning in 2026, focused on advancing secure, real-time intelligence capabilities across defense and homeland security. Building on early pilot programs, VisionWave and PVML intend to introduce a Secure Intelligence Platform and expand its reach into additional high-security and international domains over time.

VisionWave's field tested and innovative solutions are designed to enhance security, enable multi-domain operations, and drive innovation across defense and homeland security. Its technologies connect advanced analytics, AI, and real-time systems to empower decision-makers in complex operational environments.

PVML is a secure data–AI infrastructure that enables the connection of sensitive internal and operational data with AI. It provides real-time data access enforcement and instant, protocol-agnostic integration with the AI ecosystem - allowing systems and AI agents to operate safely, directly, and at scale.

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including but not limited to statements regarding the strategic collaboration with PVML, potential integrations of VisionWave's radar and AI-driven computer vision systems with PVML's data-AI infrastructure, anticipated reductions in development cycles, joint initiatives beginning in 2026, the introduction of a Secure Intelligence Platform, and expansion into additional domains. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to additional testing and qualification, export and other regulatory approvals, contract negotiations, funding, competitive pressures, technological changes, market conditions, and other factors described in VisionWave's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning. The two companies have reached an agreement to combine in a merger of equals to form the Anglo Teck group, a global critical minerals champion and top-five global copper producer, headquartered in Canada and expected to offer investors more than 70% exposure to copper. Bringing together the strengths of both companies, Anglo Teck will leverage proven capabilities in technical and operational excellence, sustainability, product marketing and project execution to deliver significant, value-accretive growth through the cycle.

B2Gold Corp.hasreleased an updateon its Goose Mine, noting that project commissioning activities are nearing completion.

Current daily throughput is approximately 75% of the 4,000 tonnes per day design capacity, and B2Gold anticipates achieving commercial production at the mine in the coming weeks.

Hudbay Minerals Inc.announcedthat Mitsubishi Corporation has agreed to acquire a 30% interest in Copper World LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudbay, which owns the fully permitted Copper World project in Arizona. ""Securing Mitsubishi as a 30% partner in Copper World is an important milestone for Hudbay as we establish a long-term strategic partnership to advance this high-quality copper project towards sanctioning and to unlock significant value in our copper growth portfolio,"" said Hudbay president and CEO Peter Kukielski.

Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp.hascompleted the acquisitionof all the issued and outstanding common shares of Orogen Royalties Inc. As part of the transaction, Triple Flag acquired 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Nevada-based Arthur gold project, formerly the Expanded Silicon gold project, being developed by AngloGold Ashanti PLC. ""The addition of a 1% NSR royalty on the Arthur gold project meaningfully enhances our portfolio with a high-quality gold asset located in a premier jurisdiction,"" said Triple Flag CEO Sheldon Vanderkooy. ""The project offers exceptional long-term growth potential, underpinned by a rapidly expanding resource base and significant exploration upside.""

From mergers and strategic partnerships to production milestones and portfolio expansions, these developments reflect a dynamic and rapidly evolving precious metals landscape. With companies positioning themselves for long-term growth, investors are watching closely as the sector continues to shine amid rising demand for gold, silver and other critical metals.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning. The two companies have reached an agreement to combine in a merger of equals to form the Anglo Teck group, a global critical minerals champion and top-five global copper producer, headquartered in Canada and expected to offer investors more than 70% exposure to copper. Bringing together the strengths of both companies, Anglo Teck will leverage proven capabilities in technical and operational excellence, sustainability, product marketing and project execution to deliver significant, value-accretive growth through the cycle.

B2Gold Corp.hasreleased an updateon its Goose Mine, noting that project commissioning activities are nearing completion. Since its first gold production in late June 2025, the Goose mill is achieving consistent performance and daily throughput is increasing. Current daily throughput is approximately 75% of the 4,000 tonnes per day design capacity, and B2Gold anticipates achieving commercial production at the mine in the coming weeks.

Hudbay Minerals Inc.announcedthat Mitsubishi Corporation has agreed to acquire a 30% interest in Copper World LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudbay, which owns the fully permitted Copper World project in Arizona. ""Securing Mitsubishi as a 30% partner in Copper World is an important milestone for Hudbay as we establish a long-term strategic partnership to advance this high-quality copper project towards sanctioning and to unlock significant value in our copper growth portfolio,"" said Hudbay president and CEO Peter Kukielski.

Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp.hascompleted the acquisitionof all the issued and outstanding common shares of Orogen Royalties Inc. As part of the transaction, Triple Flag acquired 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Nevada-based Arthur gold project, formerly the Expanded Silicon gold project, being developed by AngloGold Ashanti PLC.

ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning. The two companies have reached an agreement to combine in a merger of equals to form the Anglo Teck group, a global critical minerals champion and top-five global copper producer, headquartered in Canada and expected to offer investors more than 70% exposure to copper. Bringing together the strengths of both companies, Anglo Teck will leverage proven capabilities in technical and operational excellence, sustainability, product marketing and project execution to deliver significant, value-accretive growth through the cycle.

B2Gold Corp.hasreleased an updateon its Goose Mine, noting that project commissioning activities are nearing completion. Since its first gold production in late June 2025, the Goose mill is achieving consistent performance and daily throughput is increasing. Current daily throughput is approximately 75% of the 4,000 tonnes per day design capacity, and B2Gold anticipates achieving commercial production at the mine in the coming weeks.

Hudbay Minerals Inc.announcedthat Mitsubishi Corporation has agreed to acquire a 30% interest in Copper World LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudbay, which owns the fully permitted Copper World project in Arizona. ""Securing Mitsubishi as a 30% partner in Copper World is an important milestone for Hudbay as we establish a long-term strategic partnership to advance this high-quality copper project towards sanctioning and to unlock significant value in our copper growth portfolio,"" said Hudbay president and CEO Peter Kukielski.

Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp.hascompleted the acquisitionof all the issued and outstanding common shares of Orogen Royalties Inc. As part of the transaction, Triple Flag acquired 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Nevada-based Arthur gold project, formerly the Expanded Silicon gold project, being developed by AngloGold Ashanti PLC. ""The addition of a 1% NSR royalty on the Arthur gold project meaningfully enhances our portfolio with a high-quality gold asset located in a premier jurisdiction,"" said Triple Flag CEO Sheldon Vanderkooy. ""The project offers exceptional long-term growth potential, underpinned by a rapidly expanding resource base and significant exploration upside.""

From mergers and strategic partnerships to production milestones and portfolio expansions, these developments reflect a dynamic and rapidly evolving precious metals landscape. With companies positioning themselves for long-term growth, investors are watching closely as the sector continues to shine amid rising demand for gold, silver and other critical metals.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning. The two companies have reached an agreement to combine in a merger of equals to form the Anglo Teck group, a global critical minerals champion and top-five global copper producer, headquartered in Canada and expected to offer investors more than 70% exposure to copper.

Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning. The two companies have reached an agreement to combine in a merger of equals to form the Anglo Teck group, a global critical minerals champion and top-five global copper producer, headquartered in Canada and expected to offer investors more than 70% exposure to copper. Bringing together the strengths of both companies, Anglo Teck will leverage proven capabilities in technical and operational excellence, sustainability, product marketing and project execution to deliver significant, value-accretive growth through the cycle.

B2Gold Corp.hasreleased an updateon its Goose Mine, noting that project commissioning activities are nearing completion. Since its first gold production in late June 2025, the Goose mill is achieving consistent performance and daily throughput is increasing. Current daily throughput is approximately 75% of the 4,000 tonnes per day design capacity, and B2Gold anticipates achieving commercial production at the mine in the coming weeks.

Hudbay Minerals Inc.announcedthat Mitsubishi Corporation has agreed to acquire a 30% interest in Copper World LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudbay, which owns the fully permitted Copper World project in Arizona. ""Securing Mitsubishi as a 30% partner in Copper World is an important milestone for Hudbay as we establish a long-term strategic partnership to advance this high-quality copper project towards sanctioning and to unlock significant value in our copper growth portfolio,"" said Hudbay president and CEO Peter Kukielski.

Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp.hascompleted the acquisitionof all the issued and outstanding common shares of Orogen Royalties Inc. As part of the transaction, Triple Flag acquired 1% net smelter returns royalty on the Nevada-based Arthur gold project, formerly the Expanded Silicon gold project, being developed by AngloGold Ashanti PLC. ""The addition of a 1% NSR royalty on the Arthur gold project meaningfully enhances our portfolio with a high-quality gold asset located in a premier jurisdiction,"" said Triple Flag CEO Sheldon Vanderkooy. ""The project offers exceptional long-term growth potential, underpinned by a rapidly expanding resource base and significant exploration upside.""

From mergers and strategic partnerships to production milestones and portfolio expansions, these developments reflect a dynamic and rapidly evolving precious metals landscape. With companies positioning themselves for long-term growth, investors are watching closely as the sector continues to shine amid rising demand for gold, silver and other critical metals.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Hard Asset Rotation Strengthens as Miners Regain Leverage

Markets are undergoing a classic rotation, with leadership expanding beyond the megacap technology names into cyclical, commodity-linked sectors. Investors taking profits from crowded growth positions have turned toward underowned equities tied to hard assets.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

Historically, mining companies at or near production tend to see the strongest valuation multiples late in the cycle, as incremental increases in commodity prices flow directly into margins, boost cash generation and accelerate payback periods. Thisphenomenon, known by analysts as miners' ""torque,"" means even modest moves in metals can drive disproportionate improvements in earnings and net asset values for companies with largely fixed costs.

A weakening U.S. dollar combined with declining real yields has further fueled demand for nonyielding stores of value such as gold. When real yields fall, the cost of holding gold drops, which spurs demand both from institutional funds and long-term central bank buyers. Surveys and data from theWorld Gold Councilhighlight strong official sector accumulation and a revival of ETF inflows in recent quarters, underscoring that gold's momentum is driven not only by speculative flows but also by sustained structural demand. These forces — central bank purchases, ETF inflows and lower real rates — position gold's advance as more than a simple commodities rally, making it part of a larger currency and macroeconomic narrative.

Investor positioning reflects this shift. Mining-focused ETFs and equity baskets attracted meaningful inflows earlier in the cycle and have remained a consistent vehicle for exposure, even as flows rotate between metal ETFs and miners' ETFs. Strategists continue to emphasize that miners' earnings leverage and price-to-NAV ratios are central to the rerating thesis among institutional players. Thereturn of gold and silveras both hedges and tactical assets against inflation and FX risks has increased the spotlight on companies that can deliver near-term production with minimal capital dilution.

ESGold Positioned to Capitalize on Market Conditions

ESGold Corp.represents the type of mining company well placed to thrive in today's macro environment. The company's approach begins with a ""tailings-first"" strategy, focusing initially on itsQuebec-based Montauban project. This near-term development is designed to produce early-stage cash flow with low capital requirements and strong margins. By reducing the heavy upfront spending that typically delays returns and by limiting dilution risk, ESGold has adopted a business model that aligns with what investors reward most in a rising metals cycle.

According to the company, Montauban is fully permitted, environmentally conscious in scale and demonstrates robust economics in its updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA). ESGold has already secured financings sufficient to cover construction and early production, positioning the project to deliver cash flow in the near term. That revenue stream could, in turn, provide the means to fund additional exploration and future expansion internally. Company communications outline a phased roadmap: launch a compact processing facility to rework tailings at low cost; move quickly into sales and cash-flow generation; and then channel proceeds into further exploration, satellite projects or replicating the tailings-first template elsewhere.

In the current market, where investors are looking for both cash generation and growth potential, this dual track of early revenue and exploration upside stands out. Industry media andESGold updatesemphasize that the company is fully funded not only to complete construction at Montauban but also to advance validation work on its Colombian joint venture, key credibility markers for investor confidence.

The near-term cash flow narrative is reinforced by the latest PEA, which highlights low capital intensity, strong margins and tax advantages expected to enhance early free cash flow. For investors seeking tangible, early visibility on revenue, ESGold's business model reflects the type of project that tends to attract market rerating during commodity upcycles. Naturally, execution will hinge on factors such as construction timing, processing performance and commodity price trends, but the company's current positioning makes it a noteworthy contender.

With its latest financings secured, ESGold has indicated that it has the capital required to finish construction at Montauban and to move forward with validation efforts in Colombia. ESGold's financing plan strengthens its investment. The plan outlines its financing and how the funds are being allocated to advance the company toward production.

The difference between a company that is ""fully funded"" and one still facing funding shortfalls is significant. Firms with capital in place to reach production reduce the risk of future profile when compared with junior peers that continue to seek build-out capital.

Markets typically assign higher value to companies that can demonstrate both low capital costs and strong margins. Tailings reprocessing fits this profile well, since it generally requires less upfront investment than new mine development and often uses compact infrastructure while working with previously processed material.

ESGold's updated PEA, along with management's commentary, highlights a project expected to deliver low capex and solid operating margins. In an environment of rising precious metal prices, that mix offers meaningful leverage to free cash flow and the potential for valuation multiples above peers burdened by capital-intensive projects. Analysts frequently point to companies with these attributes as best positioned to outperform in a commodity upcycle, thanks to their speed to cash generation and low capital demands.

Tailings Reprocessing Supports ESGold's High-Margin Strategy

Tailings reprocessing offers compelling economics since the material is already located near the surface, has established grades of gold and silver, and typically requires less grinding and energy than processing fresh ore. ESGold's Montauban PEA underscores these benefits, pointing to lower operating costs, simple metallurgy and accelerated ramp-up timelines.

When combined with low capital intensity, high recoveries, if achieved at scale, can deliver top-tier operating margins, particularly in the context of rising precious metal prices. This margin structure provides investors with significant upside potential if gold and silver continue to set record highs, while also offering a degree of protection against short-term commodity price volatility.

Tailings projects also tend to face fewer permitting and environmental hurdles when designed with modern, reclamation-focused methods. ESGold has consistently promoted its clean-mining approach, positioning Montauban as a compact and permitted project with minimal environmental footprint. This strategy reduces the risk of lengthy approval processes that often delay greenfield developments. The company's regulatory readiness and local partnerships are expected to play an important role in balancing risk and reward for investors monitoring near-term execution.

Exploration Upside and Montauban's District-Scale Potential

ESGold's story extends beyond its near-term production plans. Thecompany has been advancing explorationthrough geophysics, most notably ambient noise tomography (ANT), which images to depths of 1.2 kilometers. Early results suggest structural continuity and possible deep targets beneath the tailings and zones of known mineralization.

If confirmed through drilling, advanced geophysics can open the door to district-scale opportunity. A producing tailings project paired with a discovery pipeline fits the classic ""cash flow today, exploration upside tomorrow"" model that often attracts investors. To underscore this potential, ESGold has referenced structural comparisons to Broken Hill-style systems, highlighting its belief that Montauban is best viewed as a broader district platform rather than a single-asset operation.

This concept of an embedded call option, where near-term revenue supports exploration that could dramatically revalue assets, has historically delivered strong returns when resource expansion coincides with production. At Montauban, the blend of ANT geophysics, a processing plant nearing operation and a supportive jurisdiction provides ESGold with a level of optionality uncommon among junior producers and late-stage developers. Investors are likely to pay close attention to drilling outcomes and future resource updates, since the market typically rewards visible growth that is funded by ongoing cash flow.

Colombia MOU Advances ESGold's Scalable Growth Strategy

ESGold is also moving forward with a broader, multijurisdictional expansion plan, highlighted by a binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) in Colombia aimed at validating its clean mining model across historic mining districts. This initiative reflects the company's strategy of diversifying operations while applying its tailings-first approach to regions with legacy infrastructure and known mineralization. By expanding into multiple jurisdictions, ESGold reduces concentration risk and opens additional pathways for both cash flow and asset replication.

Proving out the model in a second country could significantly amplify ESGold's growth prospects. When paired with strong environmental practices and local collaboration, replication of tailings projects can accelerate scaling while limiting permitting or technical hurdles, since such operations often rely on established remediation techniques and can align with existing environmental frameworks.

For ESGold, validation and eventual pilot production in Colombia would not only create an additional near-term revenue stream but also establish a repeatable framework for expansion across the Americas. This type of scalable trajectory is exactly the profile many value-oriented investors seek in junior mining companies that combine immediate cash flow opportunities with longer-term exploration upside.

As the precious metals market heats up, major industry players are making strategic moves to capitalize on growth and bolster their portfolios.

Teck Resources Limitedhasannounced a mergerwith Anglo American PLC designed to enhance portfolio quality, resilience and strategic positioning.

""The addition of a 1% NSR royalty on the Arthur gold project meaningfully enhances our portfolio with a high-quality gold asset located in a premier jurisdiction,"" said Triple Flag CEO Sheldon Vanderkooy. ""The project offers exceptional long-term growth potential, underpinned by a rapidly expanding resource base and significant exploration upside.""

From mergers and strategic partnerships to production milestones and portfolio expansions, these developments reflect a dynamic and rapidly evolving precious metals landscape. With companies positioning themselves for long-term growth, investors are watching closely as the sector continues to shine amid rising demand for gold, silver and other critical metals.

On June 5, 2025, Needham, Needham Bank, Provident, and BankProv entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Provident will merge with and into Needham, with Needham as the surviving entity (the ""Holdco Merger""), and, immediately thereafter, BankProv will merge with and into Needham Bank, with Needham Bank as the surviving entity (the ""Bank Merger"" and, together with the Holdco Merger, the ""Merger Transaction"").

On September 16, 2025, Provident announced that its stockholders had approved the Merger Agreement.

Needham anticipates that all required regulatory approvals will be received and all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied by November 14, 2025, and the Merger Transaction will become effective on November 15, 2025, although Needham cannot provide any assurance that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained, or whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals.

Stock and Cash Merger ConsiderationAs disclosed previously, including in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Needham with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on July 30, 2025 (the ""proxy statement/prospectus""), at the effective time of the Holdco Merger (the ""Effective Time""), shares of Provident common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each Provident stockholder, and subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, either:

On June 5, 2025, Needham, Needham Bank, Provident, and BankProv entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") pursuant to which Provident will merge with and into Needham, with Needham as the surviving entity (the ""Holdco Merger""), and, immediately thereafter, BankProv will merge with and into Needham Bank, with Needham Bank as the surviving entity (the ""Bank Merger"" and, together with the Holdco Merger, the ""Merger Transaction"").

On September 16, 2025, Provident announced that its stockholders had approved the Merger Agreement.

Needham anticipates that all required regulatory approvals will be received and all of the other closing conditions will be satisfied by November 14, 2025, and the Merger Transaction will become effective on November 15, 2025, although Needham cannot provide any assurance that all required regulatory approvals, waivers or consents will be obtained, when they will be obtained, or whether there will be burdensome conditions in the approvals or any litigation challenging the approvals.

Stock and Cash Merger ConsiderationAs disclosed previously, including in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Needham with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on July 30, 2025 (the ""proxy statement/prospectus""), at the effective time of the Holdco Merger (the ""Effective Time""), shares of Provident common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each Provident stockholder, and subject to the allocation, proration and other procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, either:

The allocation and proration provisions in the Merger Agreement ensure that 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Stock Consideration and 50% of the shares of Provident common stock will receive the Cash Consideration.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic disorders and cancer, today announced the first patient has been enrolled in the dose expansion phase of the ongoing Phase 1b study of R2891in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). R289 is Rigel's potent and selective dual inhibitor of interleukin receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4).

""Today marks an important step in the evaluation of R289 for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent lower-risk MDS, a disease with a persistent unmet need despite the availability of approved agents. In the dose expansion phase of this study, patients with transfusion dependent R/R lower-risk MDS will be randomized to receive a 500 mg R289 dose either once or twice daily,"" said Lisa Rojkjaer, M.D., Rigel's chief medical officer. ""The outcome of this phase of the study will be the selection of the recommended Phase 2 dose of R289 for future clinical studies. We remain grateful to our investigators for their continued support of our program.""

Rigel's open-label, Phase 1b study of R289 is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity in patients with R/R lower-risk MDS (NCT05308264). Enrollment in the dose escalation phase of the study was completed in July 2025, and the company expects to share updated data from the study later this year. In the dose expansion phase of the study, up to 40 patients will be randomized into dose levels of 500 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future development of R289. In addition, once the RP2D has been determined, an exploratory cohort of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) R/R, or ineligible, lower-risk MDS patients will be evaluated at the RP2D.

R289 was previously granted Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of previously-treated transfusion dependent lower-risk MDS by the FDA.

About R289R289 is a prodrug of R835, an IRAK1/4 dual inhibitor, which has been shown in preclinical studies to block inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family signaling. TLRs and IL-1Rs play a critical role in the innate immune response and dysregulation of these pathways can lead to various inflammatory conditions. Chronic stimulation of both these receptor systems is thought to cause the pro-inflammatory environment in the bone marrow responsible for persistent cytopenias in lower-risk MDS patients.2

About RigelRigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RIGL) is a biotechnology company dedicated to discovering, developing and providing novel therapies that significantly improve the lives of patients with hematologic disorders and cancer. Founded in 1996, Rigel is based in South San Francisco, California. For more information on Rigel, the Company's marketed products and pipeline of potential products, visithttp://www.rigel.com.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:RIGL), a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on hematologic disorders and cancer, today announced the first patient has been enrolled in the dose expansion phase of the ongoing Phase 1b study of R2891in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). R289 is Rigel's potent and selective dual inhibitor of interleukin receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4).

""Today marks an important step in the evaluation of R289 for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent lower-risk MDS, a disease with a persistent unmet need despite the availability of approved agents. In the dose expansion phase of this study, patients with transfusion dependent R/R lower-risk MDS will be randomized to receive a 500 mg R289 dose either once or twice daily,"" said Lisa Rojkjaer, M.D., Rigel's chief medical officer. ""The outcome of this phase of the study will be the selection of the recommended Phase 2 dose of R289 for future clinical studies. We remain grateful to our investigators for their continued support of our program.""

Rigel's open-label, Phase 1b study of R289 is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity in patients with R/R lower-risk MDS (NCT05308264). Enrollment in the dose escalation phase of the study was completed in July 2025, and the company expects to share updated data from the study later this year. In the dose expansion phase of the study, up to 40 patients will be randomized into dose levels of 500 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future development of R289. In addition, once the RP2D has been determined, an exploratory cohort of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) R/R, or ineligible, lower-risk MDS patients will be evaluated at the RP2D.

R289 was previously granted Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of previously-treated transfusion dependent lower-risk MDS by the FDA.

About R289R289 is a prodrug of R835, an IRAK1/4 dual inhibitor, which has been shown in preclinical studies to block inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family signaling. TLRs and IL-1Rs play a critical role in the innate immune response and dysregulation of these pathways can lead to various inflammatory conditions. Chronic stimulation of both these receptor systems is thought to cause the pro-inflammatory environment in the bone marrow responsible for persistent cytopenias in lower-risk MDS patients.2

(Nasdaq:RIGL) is a biotechnology company dedicated to discovering, developing and providing novel therapies that significantly improve the lives of patients with hematologic disorders and cancer.

As we enter the final quarter of 2025, we are writing to you to provide our latest update on the notable progress we have achieved in our plans to deliver improved customer support, financial performance and drive long-term growth.

The primary focus of our leadership and the Board is to ensure our business is managed effectively for the long-term benefit of our collective stakeholders – our customers, our patients, our employees and our shareholders. Following my appointment as Interim CEO in late May, andas outlined in my interim update back in June, we conducted a comprehensive top-to-bottom review of the business and created and implemented a strategic plan designed to address both the near-term challenges and future opportunities we see for NextPlat. It was clear that we needed to significantly reduce corporate overheads, recruit additional healthcare leadership, and reevaluate every operational aspect of the business. As of today, I am pleased to report that we have now made significant progress on these critical points:

Business Development and GrowthWhile reducing costs is central to our plan, supporting growth is also a critical element so I want to provide some insights on this.

NextPlat's business model is built around three core channels: Healthcare services through our PharmcoRx pharmacies; Communications products and services through our Global Telesat, Orbital Satcom and Outfitter Satellite subsidiaries; and our E-Commerce Development Program supporting the sales of U.S.-produced products into the vast Chinese market. I am pleased to report that over the past few months, significant progress has been achieved in each of these channels:

In addition to the activities outlined in this update letter, our team continues to execute across several business and product development and operational initiatives we believe have the potential to contribute to shareholder value over the long term. Some developments here to note include:

In conclusion, while challenges remain in the shorter-term, as evidenced by this CEO Update and our recent press releases, we are diligently making progress on our plans to drive measurable value for all our stakeholders and wish to thank our partners, customers, employees, and investors for their support. As a team, we intend to continue to honor our commitments to greater engagement and transparency in the months ahead and look forward to sharing additional updates on the progress we are making.

(NASDAQ:RNAZ) (""TransCode or the ""Company"") announced today that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Polynoma LLC, a privately-held biotechnology immuno-oncology company. Polynoma is developing a late-stage candidate, seviprotimut-L, a novel polyvalent shed antigen vaccine for the adjuvant treatment of stage IIB and IIC melanoma.

Concurrent with the Polynoma acquisition, TransCode announced a $25 million investment from CK Life Sciences Int'l., (Holdings) Inc. (""CK Life Sciences"") to be used primarily to advance clinical development of TransCode's lead microRNA asset, TTX-MC138, into a Phase 2 clinical trial.

Philippe Calais, PharmD, PhD, has been appointed as TransCode's Chief Executive Officer and remains Chairman of the Board of Directors, but has stepped down from his positions on the Board's Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Tom Fitzgerald steps down as Interim Chief Executive Officer but remains Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board Directors. There are no other changes to the executive team. TransCode expects to retain several finance, development and manufacturing professionals from Polynoma. Elizabeth Czerepak, MBA, has been selected as a new independent board member and becomes Chairperson of the Audit Committee, effective as of the closing of the transaction.

Dr.  Philippe Calais stated that ""I am very honored to deepen my commitment and lead TransCode's transformation into a one-of-a-kind leading oncology company at this critical time. We are grateful for CK Life Sciences' investment and their support of our miRNA candidate, TTX-MC138, as we now have the funding in place to fully execute our upcoming TTX-MC138 Phase 2. This acquisition allows us to create a unique and broader pipeline with Phase 3 ready seviprotimut-L, and potentially realize synergies between both technologies, for the ultimate benefit of patients suffering from cancer and metastases. Between the two programs, we see a unique potential to augment seviprotimut-L's focus with our microRNA lead program, TTX-MC138, by addressing the micrometastases in stage IIB and IIC melanoma patients.""

""Finally, I express my gratitude to Tom Fitzgerald for his remarkable dedication and commitment as he steps down from the Interim Chief Executive Officer position to revert to his previous role as Chief Financial Officer. I extend a warm welcome to all our new colleagues transitioning from Polynoma and to Elizabeth Czerepak, our new Independent Board member. All the ingredients are now in place to fully execute on our ambitious plan and deliver value to our shareholders"" said Dr. Calais.

Pursuant to the definitive agreement, the sole stockholder of Polynoma, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CK Life Sciences, will receive an aggregate of 83,285 shares of common stock and 1,152.9568 shares of non-voting Series A convertible preferred stock (with a 1:10,000 conversion ratio of preferred to common) (the ""Series A Preferred Stock""). Concurrent with the acquisition, TransCode entered into an investment agreement with a subsidiary  of CK Life Sciences in which that entity has purchased in a private placement an aggregate of 223.7337 shares of non-voting Series B convertible preferred stock (with a 1:10,000 conversion ratio of preferred to common) (the ""Series B Preferred Stock, and together with the Series A Preferred Stock,"" the ""Preferred Stock"") for an aggregate consideration of $25 million, consisting of $20 million in cash and a promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of $5 million.  Both transactions are expected to close on October 8, 2025. This represents, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 91% for CK Life Sciences and approximately 9% for the pre-acquisition stockholders of TransCode (including transaction fees) and a combined fully diluted equity value of approximately $165 million. Additional conditional payments totaling $95 million may be payable to the CK Life Sciences subsidiary upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for seviprotimut-L. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock issued in the acquisition and the financing shall be subject to stockholder approval in compliance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market where applicable. A non-transferrable CVR will be distributed to TransCode stockholders of record as of October 20, 2025 to receive certain proceeds received by TransCode, if any, related to future upfront, development or regulatory milestone payments resulting from a corporate partnering transaction of TTX-MC138.

Tungsten Advisors served as the exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent to TransCode. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, LLP is serving as legal counsel to TransCode. Freshfields US LLP served as legal counsel to CK Life Sciences and its subsidiaries.

TransCode is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on treating metastatic disease. The Company is committed to defeating cancer through the intelligent design and effective delivery of RNA therapeutics based on its proprietary TTX nanoparticle platform. The Company's lead therapeutic candidate, TTX-MC138, is focused on treating metastatic tumors which overexpress microRNA-10b, a unique, well-documented biomarker of metastasis. In addition, TransCode has a portfolio of other first-in-class RNA therapeutic candidates designed to overcome the challenges of RNA delivery and thus unlock therapeutic access to a variety of novel genetic targets that could be relevant to treating a variety of cancers.

(NASDAQ:RNAZ) (""TransCode or the ""Company"") announced today that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Polynoma LLC, a privately-held biotechnology immuno-oncology company. Polynoma is developing a late-stage candidate, seviprotimut-L, a novel polyvalent shed antigen vaccine for the adjuvant treatment of stage IIB and IIC melanoma.

Concurrent with the Polynoma acquisition, TransCode announced a $25 million investment from CK Life Sciences Int'l., (Holdings) Inc. (""CK Life Sciences"") to be used primarily to advance clinical development of TransCode's lead microRNA asset, TTX-MC138, into a Phase 2 clinical trial.

Philippe Calais, PharmD, PhD, has been appointed as TransCode's Chief Executive Officer and remains Chairman of the Board of Directors, but has stepped down from his positions on the Board's Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Tom Fitzgerald steps down as Interim Chief Executive Officer but remains Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board Directors. There are no other changes to the executive team. TransCode expects to retain several finance, development and manufacturing professionals from Polynoma. Elizabeth Czerepak, MBA, has been selected as a new independent board member and becomes Chairperson of the Audit Committee, effective as of the closing of the transaction.

Dr.  Philippe Calais stated that ""I am very honored to deepen my commitment and lead TransCode's transformation into a one-of-a-kind leading oncology company at this critical time. We are grateful for CK Life Sciences' investment and their support of our miRNA candidate, TTX-MC138, as we now have the funding in place to fully execute our upcoming TTX-MC138 Phase 2. This acquisition allows us to create a unique and broader pipeline with Phase 3 ready seviprotimut-L, and potentially realize synergies between both technologies, for the ultimate benefit of patients suffering from cancer and metastases. Between the two programs, we see a unique potential to augment seviprotimut-L's focus with our microRNA lead program, TTX-MC138, by addressing the micrometastases in stage IIB and IIC melanoma patients.""

""Finally, I express my gratitude to Tom Fitzgerald for his remarkable dedication and commitment as he steps down from the Interim Chief Executive Officer position to revert to his previous role as Chief Financial Officer. I extend a warm welcome to all our new colleagues transitioning from Polynoma and to Elizabeth Czerepak, our new Independent Board member. All the ingredients are now in place to fully execute on our ambitious plan and deliver value to our shareholders"" said Dr. Calais.

Pursuant to the definitive agreement, the sole stockholder of Polynoma, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CK Life Sciences, will receive an aggregate of 83,285 shares of common stock and 1,152.9568 shares of non-voting Series A convertible preferred stock (with a 1:10,000 conversion ratio of preferred to common) (the ""Series A Preferred Stock""). Concurrent with the acquisition, TransCode entered into an investment agreement with a subsidiary  of CK Life Sciences in which that entity has purchased in a private placement an aggregate of 223.7337 shares of non-voting Series B convertible preferred stock (with a 1:10,000 conversion ratio of preferred to common) (the ""Series B Preferred Stock, and together with the Series A Preferred Stock,"" the ""Preferred Stock"") for an aggregate consideration of $25 million, consisting of $20 million in cash and a promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of $5 million.  Both transactions are expected to close on October 8, 2025. This represents, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 91% for CK Life Sciences and approximately 9% for the pre-acquisition stockholders of TransCode (including transaction fees) and a combined fully diluted equity value of approximately $165 million. Additional conditional payments totaling $95 million may be payable to the CK Life Sciences subsidiary upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for seviprotimut-L. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock issued in the acquisition and the financing shall be subject to stockholder approval in compliance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market where applicable. A non-transferrable CVR will be distributed to TransCode stockholders of record as of October 20, 2025 to receive certain proceeds received by TransCode, if any, related to future upfront, development or regulatory milestone payments resulting from a corporate partnering transaction of TTX-MC138.

Tungsten Advisors served as the exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent to TransCode. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, LLP is serving as legal counsel to TransCode. Freshfields US LLP served as legal counsel to CK Life Sciences and its subsidiaries.

HENDERSON, Nev.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Research Solutions (NASDAQ:RSSS), a leading provider of AI-powered scientific research tools, today announced the launch ofScite Rankings, the first global research ranking system built on artificial intelligence-driven citation analysis.

Unlike traditional rankings that reward citation volume alone, Scite Rankings evaluates how research is cited, whether work is supported, contrasted, or simply mentioned, offering a more accurate and trustworthy measure of scientific influence across institutions, journals, and disciplines.

""For decades, research evaluation has been shaped by blunt instruments like Impact Factor and h-Index, which treat all citations equally,"" said Dr. Josh Nicholson, Chief Strategy Officer at Research Solutions. ""Scite Rankings signals a turning point. By assessing not just how often work is cited but the quality and context of those citations, we enable universities, investors, and policymakers to make evidence-based decisions about where to direct resources and build partnerships.""

At the heart of the system is Scite'sSmart Citationstechnology, which has processed more than 1.4 billion citation statements, creating the world's largest database of contextualized citation intelligence. This sophisticated AI categorizes citations as supporting, contrasting, or neutral, revealing a detailed picture of how research is received and validated by the scientific community.

The result is theScite Index, a next-generation metric that blends traditional bibliometrics with citation context. Early results show dramatic differences from conventional rankings. For example, while the University of Michigan places 47th in Times Higher Education's 2025 quality rankings and 21st in Shanghai's publication-based system, it ranks 8th in Scite's system due to the high proportion of supporting citations earned by its researchers.

""This is more than a new ranking. It is a new lens on the reliability of science,"" said Sean Rife, Head of Academic Relations for Scite. ""By emphasizing replicability and research reliability, we provide funders, governments, and investors with a clear line of sight into which institutions are delivering dependable research outcomes.""

For researchers, Scite Rankings delivers recognition for producing high-quality, reproducible work. For investors and research managers, it creates actionable intelligence for allocating capital, shaping collaborations, and reducing risk in a market where research quality directly impacts funding and innovation pipelines.

Full details of the methodology, including validation studies, are available here:https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05206.

(CSE: BIOV) (FRA: 5LB) (OTCQB:BVAXF) (""BioVaxys"" or ""Company"") is pleased to announce that James Tartaglia, PhD, a former top R&D and commercial development executive with Sanofi Vaccines, has been appointed to the BioVaxys Board of Directors.  Dr. Tartaglia fills a vacancy created by the resignation of Director Anthony Dutton, who has stepped down to focus on personal commitments. BioVaxys thanks Anthony for his outstanding service since his appointment in April 2022.

Dr. Tartaglia is an internationally recognized vaccine R&D leader with over 34 years of industry experience, including contributions to partnerships with private sector, government and international agencies.  Dr. Tartaglia recently retired as Global Head of Vaccine Development and Life Cycle Management for Sanofi, the global pharma giant with therapeutic interests in immunology and inflammation, rare diseases, neurology, oncology, and vaccines, and is the founder of Tartaglia Consulting, LLC.   During his twenty-seven years at Sanofi, Dr. Tartaglia was responsible for a vaccine portfolio of 25 projects extending from phase I/II through life cycle management in the areas of influenza, pediatric combination vaccines, RSV, rabies, Yellow Fever, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. Over his career, Dr. Tartaglia has been involved in the licensure of 20 vaccines in veterinary and human health.

Before joining Sanofi Pasteur-Canada in 1999, Dr. Tartaglia was Executive Director of Research at Virogenetics Corporation of Troy, New York, a former subsidiary of Sanofi Pasteur. At Virogenetics he helped develop the poxvirus vector technology as an immunization vehicle for both veterinary and human application, including HIV and cancer.   Prior to joining Virogenetics in 1990, Jim worked as a research scientist with the New York State Department of Health and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley, New Jersey.

BioVaxys President and Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Kovan stated, says ""We are very excited to have the support of Dr. Tartaglia on the BioVaxys board.  We are looking forward to tapping into his expertise as we prioritize DPX-based vaccine programs for fields of significant unmet need and build collaborations with global vaccine companies based on the DPX platform.""

(www.biovaxys.com), a biopharmaceuticals company registered in British Columbia, Canada, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient lives with novel immunotherapies based on the DPX™ immune-educating technology platform and it's HapTenix© tumor cell construct platform, for treating cancers, infectious disease, antigen desensitization for food allergy, and other immunological diseases. Through a differentiated mechanism of action, the DPX™ platform delivers instruction to the immune system to generate a specific, robust, and persistent immune response. The Company's clinical stage pipeline includes maveropepimut-S (MVP-S), based on the DPX™ platform, in Phase IIB clinical development for advanced Relapsed-Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and platinum resistant Ovarian Cancer. MVP-S delivers antigenic peptides from survivin, a well-recognized cancer antigen commonly overexpressed in advanced cancers, and also delivers an innate immune activator and a universal CD4 T cell helper peptide. MVP-S has been well tolerated and has demonstrated defined clinical benefit in multiple cancer indications as well as the activation of a targeted and sustained, survivin-specific anti-tumor immune response. BioVaxys is also developing DPX™+SurMAGE, a dual-targeted immunotherapy combining antigenic peptides for both the survivin and MAGE-A9 cancer proteins to elicit immune responses to these two distinct cancer antigens simultaneously, DPX™-RSV for Respiratory Syncytial Virus, DPX+rPA for peanut allergy prophylaxis, and BVX-0918, a personalized immunotherapeutic vaccine using its proprietary HapTenix© 'neoantigen' tumor cell construct platform for refractive late-stage ovarian cancer.

BOSTON,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Recorded Future, the world's leader in threat intelligence, today launched Autonomous Threat Operations at the Predict 2025 conference – a breakthrough cyber operations product that transforms how organizations defend against advanced threats.

Building on Recorded Future's industry-leading platform serving thousands of organizations worldwide, Autonomous Threat Operations represents an exponential shift in the market – transforming threat intelligence from isolated insights into automated, continuous defensive actions across the entire security ecosystem.

""Security teams are trapped by manual limitations, struggling with operationalizing threat intelligence to counter attacks that are happening at machine speed,"" said Colin Mahony, CEO of Recorded Future. ""Autonomous Threat Operations helps remove these limitations through AI-powered continuous hunting and automatic correlation within our Intelligence Graph®. This isn't incremental improvement – this is transformational.""

AI-Powered Autonomous Threat Hunting– The industry's first truly autonomous hunting capability operates continuously 24/7, eliminating the 8-12 hour weekly manual bottleneck that limits security teams to sporadic threat detection, and exponentially increasing the number of threat hunts that can be run.

Multi-Source Correlation– Automatically correlates third-party feeds (ISACs, Government feeds, etc.) within Recorded Future's Intelligence Graph®, maintaining source attribution while enabling automated actions instead of hours of manual correlation per incident.

Comprehensive Intelligence Operations requires complete coverage across three key pillars: Cyber Operations, Digital Risk Protection, and Third-party Risk Management. Autonomous Threat Operations initially focuses on Cyber Operations transformation, with new capabilities launching across the other pillars over the next quarters.

Autonomous Threat Operations is available in Early Access to Recorded Future customers. To learn more visithereor contact your Sales Representative.

Building on Recorded Future's industry-leading platform serving thousands of organizations worldwide, Autonomous Threat Operations represents an exponential shift in the market – transforming threat intelligence from isolated insights into automated, continuous defensive actions across the entire security ecosystem.

""Security teams are trapped by manual limitations, struggling with operationalizing threat intelligence to counter attacks that are happening at machine speed,"" said Colin Mahony, CEO of Recorded Future. ""Autonomous Threat Operations helps remove these limitations through AI-powered continuous hunting and automatic correlation within our Intelligence Graph®. This isn't incremental improvement – this is transformational.""

AI-Powered Autonomous Threat Hunting– The industry's first truly autonomous hunting capability operates continuously 24/7, eliminating the 8-12 hour weekly manual bottleneck that limits security teams to sporadic threat detection, and exponentially increasing the number of threat hunts that can be run.

Multi-Source Correlation– Automatically correlates third-party feeds (ISACs, Government feeds, etc.) within Recorded Future's Intelligence Graph®, maintaining source attribution while enabling automated actions instead of hours of manual correlation per incident.

Comprehensive Intelligence Operations requires complete coverage across three key pillars: Cyber Operations, Digital Risk Protection, and Third-party Risk Management. Autonomous Threat Operations initially focuses on Cyber Operations transformation, with new capabilities launching across the other pillars over the next quarters.

Autonomous Threat Operations is available in Early Access to Recorded Future customers. To learn more visithereor contact your Sales Representative.

Recorded Future is the world's largest threat intelligence company, serving over 1,900 businesses and government organizations across 80 countries. The Recorded Future platform provides the most complete coverage across adversaries, infrastructure, and targets through the Intelligence Graph® containing 200+ billion nodes of specialized threat data. By combining precise, AI-driven analytics with breakthrough autonomous capabilities, Recorded Future enables organizations to transform from manual threat intelligence limitations to Intelligence Operations that automatically operationalize threats across entire security ecosystems.

WASHINGTON,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Monumental Sports & Entertainment(MSE) today announcedVanda Pharmaceuticals(Nasdaq:VNDA), a leading global biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Washington, D.C., as the organization's newest Founding Partner for its next-generation arena in downtown Washington. A centerpiece of the agreement is Vanda's exclusive entitlement of the best-in-class Monumental Sports Network (MNMT) studio – now officially named the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio – home to pre- and post-game coverage, original content, and dynamic storytelling spanning MSE's full sports portfolio and more.

After signing on as the ""marquee"" jersey patch partner for the WNBA's Washington Mystics earlier this year, Vanda becomes the second Founding Partner of Monumental's transformative Capital One Arena project, joining United Airlines in supporting this world-class sports and entertainment destination. The multi-year, integrated partnership with MSE includes brand alignment with the NBA's Washington Wizards, NHL's Washington Capitals, Mystics, and extensive reach across MNMT – the company's award-winning regional media platform, setting new standards for local sports coverage.

""This is a bold, future-facing partnership that reflects the shared ambition of Monumental and Vanda to tell bigger stories, reach wider audiences, and uplift the D.C. community,"" said Ted Leonsis, Founder, Chairman, Managing Partner, and CEO at MSE. ""Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a hometown success story with a global footprint. As a Founding Partner and the entitlement sponsor of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, they will play a major role in shaping our media future, enhancing the fan experience, and powering this transformational development in downtown D.C.""

As MSE continues to redefine the regional sports media experience, a cornerstone of this partnership is Vanda's exclusive entitlement of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, the broadcast epicenter of MNMT. Opened in March 2024, the studio sits within MNMT's two-story, SMPTE 2110-certified facility, representing one of the most advanced regional media environments in the country. It features two fully equipped studios — with the ability to merge into a single national telecast-caliber set on non-conflict nights — powered by 24 cameras, 1,200 square feet of 4K LED displays, and cutting-edge robotics.

As the named studio partner, Vanda will be prominently embedded in every layer of content produced by MNMT, from pre- and post-game shows to digital and longform storytelling. Distributed via cable, streaming, and social platforms across the DMV and beyond, MSE's media platform has rapidly grown into one of the most influential and innovative regional sports networks in the country, connecting with millions of fans each season.

""As Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a Washington, D.C. headquartered company, we are honored to become an integral part of the 'Sports Capital' and help lead the exciting transformation of the sports and entertainment district in downtown Washington,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos MD, CEO, President and Chairman of the Board of Vanda Pharmaceuticals. ""This alliance with Monumental is a shared vision to promote growth and opportunity in the nation's capital, fostering innovation and community through sports, media, and shared experiences that bring people together.""

In addition to its entitlement of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, Vanda will be featured across multiple MSE platforms including:

Vanda will have a prominent presence in the newly transformed Capital One Arena — an iconic sports and entertainment destination in the heart of the nation's capital that welcomes three million guests each year. Today's announcement comes as Phase One of construction nears completion in the next-generation arena.

WASHINGTON,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Monumental Sports & Entertainment(MSE) today announcedVanda Pharmaceuticals(Nasdaq:VNDA), a leading global biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Washington, D.C., as the organization's newest Founding Partner for its next-generation arena in downtown Washington. A centerpiece of the agreement is Vanda's exclusive entitlement of the best-in-class Monumental Sports Network (MNMT) studio – now officially named the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio – home to pre- and post-game coverage, original content, and dynamic storytelling spanning MSE's full sports portfolio and more.

After signing on as the ""marquee"" jersey patch partner for the WNBA's Washington Mystics earlier this year, Vanda becomes the second Founding Partner of Monumental's transformative Capital One Arena project, joining United Airlines in supporting this world-class sports and entertainment destination. The multi-year, integrated partnership with MSE includes brand alignment with the NBA's Washington Wizards, NHL's Washington Capitals, Mystics, and extensive reach across MNMT – the company's award-winning regional media platform, setting new standards for local sports coverage.

""This is a bold, future-facing partnership that reflects the shared ambition of Monumental and Vanda to tell bigger stories, reach wider audiences, and uplift the D.C. community,"" said Ted Leonsis, Founder, Chairman, Managing Partner, and CEO at MSE. ""Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a hometown success story with a global footprint. As a Founding Partner and the entitlement sponsor of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, they will play a major role in shaping our media future, enhancing the fan experience, and powering this transformational development in downtown D.C.""

As MSE continues to redefine the regional sports media experience, a cornerstone of this partnership is Vanda's exclusive entitlement of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, the broadcast epicenter of MNMT. Opened in March 2024, the studio sits within MNMT's two-story, SMPTE 2110-certified facility, representing one of the most advanced regional media environments in the country. It features two fully equipped studios — with the ability to merge into a single national telecast-caliber set on non-conflict nights — powered by 24 cameras, 1,200 square feet of 4K LED displays, and cutting-edge robotics.

As the named studio partner, Vanda will be prominently embedded in every layer of content produced by MNMT, from pre- and post-game shows to digital and longform storytelling. Distributed via cable, streaming, and social platforms across the DMV and beyond, MSE's media platform has rapidly grown into one of the most influential and innovative regional sports networks in the country, connecting with millions of fans each season.

""As Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a Washington, D.C. headquartered company, we are honored to become an integral part of the 'Sports Capital' and help lead the exciting transformation of the sports and entertainment district in downtown Washington,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos MD, CEO, President and Chairman of the Board of Vanda Pharmaceuticals. ""This alliance with Monumental is a shared vision to promote growth and opportunity in the nation's capital, fostering innovation and community through sports, media, and shared experiences that bring people together.""

In addition to its entitlement of the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Studio, Vanda will be featured across multiple MSE platforms including:

Vanda will have a prominent presence in the newly transformed Capital One Arena — an iconic sports and entertainment destination in the heart of the nation's capital that welcomes three million guests each year. Today's announcement comes as Phase One of construction nears completion in the next-generation arena. MSE is taking a 360-degree approach to reimagining the fan experience, with a focus on cutting-edge technology, immersive design, and community impact — creating a high-tech, high-touch venue built to inspire millions of annual visitors for the next 25 years.

Leidos will upgrade the systems that help air traffic controllers safely manage planes on the ground and in the air. In addition to a hardware refresh, Leidos will install its SkyLine-X Air Traffic Management system that will provide controllers with end-to-end surveillance, improved safety functions and streamlined operations. SkyLine-X brings a common automation platform with a modular and open architecture that is designed to be resilient, easy to use, and flexible for future needs.

""Over the past 20 years, Leidos has been more than a supplier; they have been a strategic ally,"" said Faat Bogdashkin, Director General of Kazaeronavigatsia. ""They have consistently anticipated our needs and involved their solutions to help us navigate a changing market. We look forward to continuing our successful cooperation with Leidos on the Air Traffic Management System modernization with SkyLine-X. It is important to meet our mission to safely manage the growing volume of air traffic in Kazakhstan.""

The agreement has a 19-year period of performance and includes work at four control centers and 21 towers across the country.

""We value the trust we've built over the past two decades working with KAN,"" said Liz Porter, Leidos Health and Civil Sector president. ""The skies over Kazakhstan are key to international flight paths and this upgrade helps support the country's safe and reliable air traffic system and allows controllers to continue managing the airspace with increased confidence.""

According to the Kazakhstan government, by 2030, the country's annual passenger traffic is expected to reach 26 million people, up from almost 15 million, its civil aircraft fleet is expected to more than double, and 81 new international destinations are to be added. Drawing on a track record of safely guiding flights across U.S. and global skies, Leidos is well positioned to efficiently modernize Kazakhstan's air traffic control infrastructure and meet the demands of the future.

Kazakhstan currently has a flight safety rating of 82%, well above the global average of 70.8%, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Leidos is an industry and technology leader serving government and commercial customers with smarter, more efficient digital and mission innovations. Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, with 47,000 global employees, Leidos reported annual revenues of approximately $16.7 billion for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2025.

NEW YORK,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Roundhill Investments, an ETF sponsor recognized for its innovative financial products, today announced the launch of the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (NYSE Arca: MEME).

The Roundhill Meme Stock ETF offers targeted exposure to the retail-driven meme trade. What started with GameStop's historic short squeeze and AMC's headline-grabbing rallies has grown into a lasting feature of the market, whereby retail investors can collectively move public companies by billions in market value. Most recently, we've seen OpenDoor become the latest reminder of how quickly retail enthusiasm can fuel extreme volatility in stock prices.

MEME can be a potential tool for investors and traders alike, whether as a momentum-driven trade for those seeking to ride retail enthusiasm, or as a hedge against a short book given the unpredictable surges these names can experience.

""Meme stocks started as a rebellion but have grown into a revolution,"" said Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investments. ""From GameStop to AMC and beyond, retail investors have proven that they are here to stay as a permanent force in the market. With MEME, we offer investors a tool to capture that power through an actively managed ETF that can rotate quickly into the stocks dominating the conversation today.""

Meme Stock Risk.Meme Stocks are characterized by high trading volumes and significant price volatility, often driven by social media trends and investor interest. More traditional investing principles emphasize the intrinsic value of a company's underlying business such as its cash flows, competitive position, and long-term growth prospects, when determining whether to buy or sell a particular security. In contrast, Meme Stocks often trade untethered from such fundamentals, driven instead by speculative fervor and viral momentum. While the Fund seeks to capitalize on the trading momentum associated with Meme Stocks, there is a risk that such stocks may experience rapid and unpredictable price movements that could abate or reverse quickly. Because a stock only becomes eligible for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio after it has experienced a significant amount of liquidity and volatility, it is possible that by the time the Fund purchases shares of a Meme Stock it will have missed out on the initial gains, but will nevertheless experience any subsequent decline in value. Additionally, the identification of Meme Stocks is inherently subjective and may vary . As a result, stocks that are widely recognized as Meme Stocks may not be selected for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio. Conversely, stocks included in the Fund may not be perceived as Meme Stocks by the broader market. Investors should be aware that investing in Meme Stocks involves a high degree of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.The volatile nature of these investments may lead to significant fluctuations in the Fund's net asset value and could result in potential loss.

Active Management Risk.The Fund is actively-managed and its performance reflects investment decisions that the Adviser and/or Sub-Adviser makes for the Fund. Such judgments about the Fund's investments may prove to be incorrect. If the investments selected and the strategies employed by the Fund fail to produce the intended results, the Fund could underperform as compared to other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies, or could have negative returns.

Non-Diversification Risk.As a ""non-diversified"" fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of the Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.

Volatility Risk. Volatility is the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. The Fund will invest in securities that exhibit more volatility than the market as a whole. Such exposures could cause the Fund's net asset value to experience significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time.

New Fund Risk.The Fund is a recently organized investment company with a limited operating history. As a result, prospective investors have a limited track record or history on which to base their investment decision.

Roundhill Financial Inc. serves as the investment advisor. The Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC which is not affiliated with Roundhill Financial Inc., U.S. Bank, or any of their affiliates.

NEW YORK,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Roundhill Investments, an ETF sponsor recognized for its innovative financial products, today announced the launch of the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (NYSE Arca: MEME).

The Roundhill Meme Stock ETF offers targeted exposure to the retail-driven meme trade. What started with GameStop's historic short squeeze and AMC's headline-grabbing rallies has grown into a lasting feature of the market, whereby retail investors can collectively move public companies by billions in market value. Most recently, we've seen OpenDoor become the latest reminder of how quickly retail enthusiasm can fuel extreme volatility in stock prices.

MEME can be a potential tool for investors and traders alike, whether as a momentum-driven trade for those seeking to ride retail enthusiasm, or as a hedge against a short book given the unpredictable surges these names can experience.

""Meme stocks started as a rebellion but have grown into a revolution,"" said Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investments. ""From GameStop to AMC and beyond, retail investors have proven that they are here to stay as a permanent force in the market. With MEME, we offer investors a tool to capture that power through an actively managed ETF that can rotate quickly into the stocks dominating the conversation today.""

Meme Stock Risk.Meme Stocks are characterized by high trading volumes and significant price volatility, often driven by social media trends and investor interest. More traditional investing principles emphasize the intrinsic value of a company's underlying business such as its cash flows, competitive position, and long-term growth prospects, when determining whether to buy or sell a particular security. In contrast, Meme Stocks often trade untethered from such fundamentals, driven instead by speculative fervor and viral momentum. While the Fund seeks to capitalize on the trading momentum associated with Meme Stocks, there is a risk that such stocks may experience rapid and unpredictable price movements that could abate or reverse quickly. Because a stock only becomes eligible for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio after it has experienced a significant amount of liquidity and volatility, it is possible that by the time the Fund purchases shares of a Meme Stock it will have missed out on the initial gains, but will nevertheless experience any subsequent decline in value. Additionally, the identification of Meme Stocks is inherently subjective and may vary . As a result, stocks that are widely recognized as Meme Stocks may not be selected for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio. Conversely, stocks included in the Fund may not be perceived as Meme Stocks by the broader market. Investors should be aware that investing in Meme Stocks involves a high degree of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.The volatile nature of these investments may lead to significant fluctuations in the Fund's net asset value and could result in potential loss.

Active Management Risk.The Fund is actively-managed and its performance reflects investment decisions that the Adviser and/or Sub-Adviser makes for the Fund. Such judgments about the Fund's investments may prove to be incorrect. If the investments selected and the strategies employed by the Fund fail to produce the intended results, the Fund could underperform as compared to other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies, or could have negative returns.

Non-Diversification Risk.As a ""non-diversified"" fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of the Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.

Volatility Risk. Volatility is the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. The Fund will invest in securities that exhibit more volatility than the market as a whole. Such exposures could cause the Fund's net asset value to experience significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time.

New Fund Risk.The Fund is a recently organized investment company with a limited operating history. As a result, prospective investors have a limited track record or history on which to base their investment decision.

Most recently, we've seen OpenDoor become the latest reminder of how quickly retail enthusiasm can fuel extreme volatility in stock prices.

MEME can be a potential tool for investors and traders alike, whether as a momentum-driven trade for those seeking to ride retail enthusiasm, or as a hedge against a short book given the unpredictable surges these names can experience.

""Meme stocks started as a rebellion but have grown into a revolution,"" said Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investments. ""From GameStop to AMC and beyond, retail investors have proven that they are here to stay as a permanent force in the market. With MEME, we offer investors a tool to capture that power through an actively managed ETF that can rotate quickly into the stocks dominating the conversation today.""

Meme Stock Risk.Meme Stocks are characterized by high trading volumes and significant price volatility, often driven by social media trends and investor interest. More traditional investing principles emphasize the intrinsic value of a company's underlying business such as its cash flows, competitive position, and long-term growth prospects, when determining whether to buy or sell a particular security. In contrast, Meme Stocks often trade untethered from such fundamentals, driven instead by speculative fervor and viral momentum. While the Fund seeks to capitalize on the trading momentum associated with Meme Stocks, there is a risk that such stocks may experience rapid and unpredictable price movements that could abate or reverse quickly. Because a stock only becomes eligible for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio after it has experienced a significant amount of liquidity and volatility, it is possible that by the time the Fund purchases shares of a Meme Stock it will have missed out on the initial gains, but will nevertheless experience any subsequent decline in value. Additionally, the identification of Meme Stocks is inherently subjective and may vary . As a result, stocks that are widely recognized as Meme Stocks may not be selected for inclusion in the Fund's portfolio. Conversely, stocks included in the Fund may not be perceived as Meme Stocks by the broader market. Investors should be aware that investing in Meme Stocks involves a high degree of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.The volatile nature of these investments may lead to significant fluctuations in the Fund's net asset value and could result in potential loss.

Active Management Risk.The Fund is actively-managed and its performance reflects investment decisions that the Adviser and/or Sub-Adviser makes for the Fund. Such judgments about the Fund's investments may prove to be incorrect. If the investments selected and the strategies employed by the Fund fail to produce the intended results, the Fund could underperform as compared to other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies, or could have negative returns.

Non-Diversification Risk.As a ""non-diversified"" fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of the Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.

Volatility Risk. Volatility is the characteristic of a security, an index or a market to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. The Fund will invest in securities that exhibit more volatility than the market as a whole. Such exposures could cause the Fund's net asset value to experience significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time.

New Fund Risk.The Fund is a recently organized investment company with a limited operating history. As a result, prospective investors have a limited track record or history on which to base their investment decision.

Roundhill Financial Inc. serves as the investment advisor. The Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC which is not affiliated with Roundhill Financial Inc., U.S. Bank, or any of their affiliates.

LUXEMBOURG and DUBLIN,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --SEI®(NASDAQ:SEIC) today announced that the company was selected by H.I.G. Capital (H.I.G.), a leading global alternative investments firm with $70 billion of capital under management, to provide fund administration and depositary services for certain Luxembourg and Cayman Island-domiciled private equity and infrastructure assets.

H.I.G. provides equity and debt capital to middle-market companies and has managed more than 400 companies worldwide. The firm's fund strategies include private equity, growth equity, real estate, direct lending, infrastructure, special situations debt, and growth-stage healthcare. SEI's infrastructure will enable seamless integration with H.I.G.'s existing platforms to automate workflows, reduce manual data entry, eliminate duplication, and enhance data transparency.

Commenting on the strategic partnership, Brendan Dolan, European Chief Financial Officer at H.I.G., said:

""SEI's global scale, broad operational and technology capabilities, expertise in fund administration and private markets, and local service all provide a significant competitive edge, and make them the ideal partner to support our strategic business goals. We're delighted to work with SEI to ensure greater operational efficiency and streamlined data management as we grow and continue to serve our limited partners.""

Bryan Astheimer, Head of SEI's Investment Managers business for EMEA, added:

""Many firms are seeking a strategic partner with global private markets expertise and capabilities that help eliminate in-house data replication and improve efficiency. We're excited to partner with H.I.G., a firm that shares our commitment to delivering solutions that add strategic and operational value for clients.

ANDOVER, Mass.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Raytheon, an RTX (NYSE:RTX) business, has been selected by the German government to provide the Raytheon-built SPY-6(V)1 radar for installation on eight of its F127 frigates under a requested foreign military sales contract with the U.S. Navy. The contract, which would also include comprehensive support and services to adapt the radar to the ship's design, will make Germany the first international customer for SPY-6.

It is part of the U.S. Navy'sSPY-6 family of radarsthat performs air and missile defense on seven classes of ships and is a giant leap in capability for the fleet.

SEATTLE,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Spectral Capital Corporation (OTCQB:FCCN) (""Spectral"") announced today that it has executed a binding term sheet to acquire MultiCortex, LLC, a world leader in the design and deployment of heterogeneous computing systems optimized for artificial intelligence (AI).

This transaction positions the combined company to lead a new era of computing — one defined by native AI operating systems, AI-native heterogeneous architectures, and quantum-ready integration. While most current PCs exhibit a small degree of heterogeneity through CPUs, HPU, XPU and GPUs, few systems integrate native AI Accelerators directly into their architecture. As AI becomes central to nearly all computing tasks, the demand for systems that support persistent, private, and local AI capabilities has never been greater.

""Today's consumer and business users are devoting an ever-increasing percentage of their computer time to AI tasks,"" said Jenifer Osterwalder, CEO of Spectral Capital. ""They want their AI to be available across applications, to update automatically, and to run locally for maximum privacy. The Spectral–MultiCortex combination uniquely addresses this need with systems purpose-built for AI-native performance, privacy, and adaptability. Together, we expect to become a global leader in next-generation AI hardware and operating systems.""

MultiCortex has established itself as an innovative company in heterogeneous computing, offering a complete and optimized operating system for Artificial Intelligence processing including Computer Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and other high-performance segments. The company's platform enables seamless deployment of AI workloads across diverse processors and accelerators, delivering unprecedented efficiency and scalability.

Beyond its proven expertise in AI-native system design, MultiCortex is also advancing the intersection of AI operating systems and quantum computing. Led by Chief Technology Officer, Alessandro ""Cabelo"" Faria, an Intel Global Innovator, the company is building an architecture designed to seamlessly leverage hybrid quantum cloud computing as it becomes commercially viable. This integration will provide MultiCortex users an early and sustained advantage in adopting quantum-accelerated AI applications — enabling them to tackle complex workloads with unmatched speed and precision.

""Combining MultiCortex's proven hardware design and systems expertise with Spectral's deep intellectual property portfolio and financial resources creates a powerhouse for innovation,"" said Thiago Moura da Silva, of MultiCortex. ""Our shared vision is to build computers that think locally — machines where AI is not an add-on, but a native capability woven into the fabric of the operating system itself. And as quantum computing comes online, our users will be among the first to benefit from true hybrid AI-quantum workflows.""

Following completion of a PCAOB-certified audit and Spectral's uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market, Spectral will invest up to $15 million in the MultiCortex business unit to accelerate product development and commercialization. Spectral also anticipates leveraging its extensive patent library and filing infrastructure to become the world's largest filer of new native AI operating system patents by the end of 2025.

The companies expect to complete due diligence and finalize definitive agreements shortly, with closing subject to customary approvals and conditions.

Spectral Capital (OTCQB:FCCN) is an innovation-driven company focused on building, acquiring, and scaling products at the frontier of artificial intelligence. Spectral's strategy combines original invention, an active pending‑patent pipeline, and disciplined productization to create durable value across enterprise and SMB markets.

MADISON, Wis.,Oct. 8, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Accuray Incorporated(NASDAQ:ARAY) announced today that5D Clinicshas treated the first patients in the city of Melbourne, Australia, using theCyberKnife S7™ System. 5D Clinics and joint venture partnerIcon Groupwill open and operate CyberKnife System centers across Australia*, with the goal of making it easier for cancer patients to obtain state-of-the-art precision robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radio surgery (SRS) treatments closer to home. With an initial focus on the East Coast of Australia, the new center in Melbourne is the first to be managed by the JV.

""We couldn't be prouder to announce the first CyberKnife System patient treatments resulting from our partnership with the 5D Clinics and Icon Group joint venture. We have a shared vision and commitment to advancing cancer care globally and the opening of the center in Melbourne is a first step―and important reminder―of the power of determination in bringing that vision to life,"" said Suzanne Winter, president and CEO of Accuray. ""The CyberKnife System fills an unmet need in Australia to improve community access to this powerful technology that offers both personalized and precise cancer care treatments. We look forward to continuing to work together with 5D Clinics, Icon Group and our long-term distributor partner alphaXRT, to transform cancer management in the region.""

We look forward to continuing to work together with 5D Clinics, Icon Group and our long-term distributor partner alphaXRT, to transform cancer management in the region.""

The number of new cancer cases diagnosed in Australia is projected to grow from 212,332 in 2022 to 318,285 in 20451, a nearly 50 percent increase1. The rise in patient diagnoses reinforces the need for innovative new treatment options, such as the CyberKnife System, that can effectively manage the disease while improving the care journey and its impact on patients' quality of life.

One of the first patients treated was David, a 55-year old diagnosed with prostate cancer.

""Choosing the CyberKnife System gave me such relief knowing I didn't have to face surgery or long hospital stays,"" David said.

""It's allowed me to keep working and get on with life without the downtime of traditional procedures. The results I've seen, and the information from my specialist, have been really reassuring and given me confidence about the future.

""What's also made a difference is being treated here by Dr. Paul Conway — he's been fantastic. Being able to reach out to Paul directly and get the answers I needed is something you don't often experience, and it's made this journey so much easier.

""To anyone starting their cancer journey, I'd say get as much information as you can and connect with specialists who take the time to guide you — that support has been invaluable for me.""

5D Clinics in Perth, Western Australia, was the country's only private entity using the CyberKnife System. Now, in collaboration with Icon Group, Australia's largest dedicated private provider of cancer care with a growing reach in Asia and the United Kingdom, they are taking a pivotal step toward increasing patient access to SRS and SBRT. The CyberKnife S7 System will enable them to deliver radiation treatments more efficiently than previous generation models, minimizing the time patients spend in daily treatments and maximizing the number of patients that can be treated each day.

General Manager for 5D Clinics Australia, Bruno Bosco said this partnership will help turn the dial on cancer care.

""The introduction of the CyberKnife®System to Melbourne means patients no longer need to travel interstate to access this advanced level of care. It provides more choice and the possibility of better patient outcomes and improved quality of life. We're really excited to see the benefits of this service and look forward to continuing to work alongside Accuray to install more CyberKnife Systems across Australia's east coast,"" said Bruno.

The CyberKnife S7™ System combines speed, precision, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and automatically adapt for movement during treatment, delivering the radiation dose directly to the target anywhere in the body. The precision and accuracy of the system enables medical teams to deliver very high doses of radiation in a few days versus conventional fractionation which often require 30-40 sessions. The entire CyberKnife System procedure is typically completed in just 1 to 5 out-patient sessions, making radiation treatments delivered with sub-millimeter precision and accuracy an option for people unable to travel a month or more for care.

alphaXRT is the exclusive distributor, installer and training partner for the Accuray CyberKnife and TomoTherapy®platform portfolios in Australasia. In close cooperation with the Accuray global team, 5D Clinics and Icon Group, they supported the entire CyberKnife System installation process through the first patient treatment, and will provide ongoing service and assistance.

High fees and low value top banking pain points for over half of Canadian small business owners

A new survey of Canadian small business owners, conducted by EQ Bank among members of the online Angus Reid Forum, highlights where traditional banking is falling short. The survey found that over half (52%) of small business owners cite steep costs and low interest as their top concerns with business banking. When asked about their single biggest pain point, 25% pointed to high or unexpected fees. Another 15% pointed to not seeing enough value for their money, while 12% said low interest rates on balances were their top frustration.

""Small business owners told us they're weighed down by high bank fees, low interest rates and poor service,"" said Cathy Ly, VP, Small Business Banking, EQ Bank. ""Our new platform is built to address those pain points with competitive rates, transparent pricing and digital‑first convenience – delivering practical solutions that respect their time, reward their deposits and help them run and grow their business.""

For more than a quarter of respondents (27%), customer service challenges were their biggest frustration – 15% pointed to difficulty reaching a live person because of pre-recorded phone systems while another 12% cited poor customer service generally.

""Being able to reach a real person is fundamental to trust in banking, and small business owners have told us that this matters,"" added Ly. ""That's why we've invested in a dedicated customer service team based here in Canada. We strongly believe great service means being there in a meaningful way when our customers need us.""
