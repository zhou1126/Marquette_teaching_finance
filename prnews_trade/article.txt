VANCOUVER, BC,Sept. 10, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Corporate treasury companies surge an average of 150% within 24 hours of announcingcryptoadoption strategies, according to a 2025Animoca Brandsreport[1], asdigital assettreasuries amass$113 billioninBitcoinstockpiles throughSeptember 2025[2]. The explosive momentum reflects a fundamental shift from traditional cash reserves to strategiccryptocurrencyaccumulation, withCrypto.comreporting over 90 public companies now holdingBitcoinon their balance sheets[3]as corporate America embraces digital assets as inflation hedges and growth catalysts. This treasury transformation is helping to position companies embracing it, includingCEA Industries, Inc.(NASDAQ:BNC),Kindly MD, Inc.(NASDAQ:NAKA),Metaplanet Inc.(OTCQX:MTPLF),The Smarter Web Company PLC(OTCQB:TSWCF), andCipher Mining Inc.(NASDAQ:CIFR).

Institutional demand accelerates asBlackRock'sBitcoinETF attracted$289.8 millionin fresh inflows onSeptember 4alone[4], while Strategy's treasury model has delivered 257% returns by aggressively accumulating over 582,000 BTC worth$62 billion[5]. The convergence of regulatory clarity, ETF accessibility, and corporate adoption creates unprecedented supply-demand dynamics, with analysts projecting continued institutional accumulation as pension funds and sovereign wealth entities prepare their owndigital assetallocations, thus rewarding companies that establish strategic positions before the broader institutional wave arrives.

CEA Industries(NASDAQ:BNC) recentlystrengthened its institutional foundationthrough the appointment of Dr.Russell Read, Ph.D., CFA, as a non-executive board member, further cementing its transformation into a premierBNB treasury operation. Dr. Read's extensive background managing capital atCalPERS,Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, andGulf Investment Corporation—where he oversaw hundreds of billions across global markets—brings heavyweight institutional expertise to theColorado-based firm's aggressive BNB accumulation strategy.

This leadership enhancement coincides withCEA Industries'rapid expansion of its BNB position, which has grown to388,888 tokensworth approximately$330 million. The company maintains its ambitious goal of securing 1% of BNB's total circulating supply by early 2026, representing a concentrated bet on the world's most actively used blockchain network for daily transactions.

"Since the announcement of their BNB Treasury,CEA Industrieshas swiftly established itself as a global leader indigital assettreasury management," said Dr. Read. "I look forward to working with David [Namdar, CEO ofCEA Industries (BNC)] and the Board to further strengthen governance, expand institutional engagement, and position CEA Industries for long-term success."

BNC'sstrategic approach centers entirely on BNB's foundational role within the most utilized blockchain ecosystem for everyday transactions anddecentralizedfinance operations. Instead of diversifying across multiple digital assets, the company has committed exclusively to BNB's ecosystem potential, believing this focused strategy maximizes exposure to network effects while enabling direct participation in on-chain yield opportunities.

This concentrated approach emerged from a transformativeprivate placement of$500 millionthat completely restructured the company from its previous operations into a pure-play BNB treasury vehicle. The funding round drew over 140 institutional andcrypto-native investors, includingPantera Capital,Arche Capital,ExodusPoint Capital Management, andBlockchain.com, withCantor Fitzgerald & Co.acting as exclusive placement agent and lead financial advisor.

BNB's attraction lies in its distinctive blend of utility and deflationary mechanics. Thetokenpowers millions of daily transactions while delivering staking rewards and benefiting from quarterly supply burns through automated reduction mechanisms. Unlike speculative digital assets, BNB demonstrates consistent economic utility across trading infrastructure, payment networks, anddecentralizedapplication environments.

CEA Industries'leadership team merges profoundcryptoexpertise with traditional finance experience.

Dr. Read's addition provides sovereign wealth fund management expertise spanning decades and multiple regions.Hans Thomasof10X Capitaloversees treasury operations, contributing public company and capital markets knowledge to the BNB accumulation framework.

The company fills a critical market void for U.S. investors lacking direct BNB access through traditional brokerage platforms.BNCdelivers regulated market exposure to BNB's performance without requiringcryptocurrencywallets, exchange registrations, or technical blockchain expertise. Investors gain BNB ecosystem exposure through conventional equity ownership in a NASDAQ-listed entity.
