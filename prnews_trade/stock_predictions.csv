NEW YORK,Sept. 14, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (""Lantheus"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:LNTH) and reminds investors of theNovember 10, 2025deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices inNew York,Pennsylvania,CaliforniaandGeorgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with misleading statements concerning the true state of Pylarify's competitive position; notably, that Lantheus was not equipped to properly assess the pricing and competitive dynamics for Pylarify, risking Pylarify's price point, revenue, and overall growth potential. These statements caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Lantheus' securities at artificially inflated prices.

Investors began to question the veracity of Defendants' public statements onMay 7, 2025, when Lantheus reported its first quarter results below market expectations with Pylarify's performance particularly falling short. Then, onAugust 6, 2025, Lantheus again announced disappointing results and significantly reduced growth expectations for Pylarify, which had fallen 8.3% year-over-year, and slashed fiscal year 2025 growth projections. Defendants attributed the losses to the ongoing competition, impacting Pylarify's pricing dynamics.

Investors and analysts reacted promptly to Lantheus' revelations. The price of Lantheus' common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of$72.83per share onAugust 5, 2025, Lantheus' stock price fell to$51.87per share onAugust 6, 2025, a decline of about 28.8% in the span of one day.",1,"Lantheus Holdings, Inc.",LNTH,5.0,-10.0,-5.0,-15.0,The stock is expected to face continued pressure due to ongoing legal issues and disappointing financial results.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) saw the price of their shares crater over$216(-36%) after the company reported its Q3 2025 financial results and revealed significant problems with a major foundry customer.

The development has prompted national shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman to open an investigation into whether Synopsys may havemisled investorsabout its customer risks and growth prospects.

The firm urges investors in Synopsys who suffered significant losses tosubmit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

In the past Synopsys has assured investors that, while its largest customer (Intel) had reduced its R&D spend, ""it does not impact generally the EDA software[]"" and downplayed risks based on its ""committed, non-cancellable"" agreements with Intel involving a mix of EDA software, IP, and hardware.

The company's assurances may have come into question onSeptember 9, 2025, when Synopsys reported its Q3 2025 financial results and shockingly guided for Q4 2025 GAAP EPS of negative$0.27to negative$0.16.

During the earnings call, management revealed the company's underperformance in its IP business and said it was significantly due to ""challenges at a major foundry customer"" that is ""also having a sizeable impact on the year[.]""

What to do next: To join the Lineage class action, go tohttps://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43296or callPhillip Kim, Esq.at 866-767-3653 or email[email protected]for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later thanSeptember 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over$438 millionfor investors. In 2020, founding partnerLaurence Rosenwas named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, the registration statement was false and/or misleading and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Lineage was then experiencing sustained weakening in customer demand, as additional cold-storage supply had come on line, Lineage's customers destocked a glut of excessive inventory built up during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Lineage's customers shifted to maintaining leaner cold-storage inventories on a go-forward basis in response to changed consumer trends; (2) Lineage had implemented price increases in the lead-up to the IPO that could not be sustained in light of the weakening demand environment facing Lineage; (3) Lineage was unable to effectively counteract the adverse trends listed above through the use of minimum storage guarantees or as a result of operational efficiencies, technological improvements, or its purported competitive advantages; (4) as a result, rather than enjoying stable revenue growth, high occupancy rates, and steady rent escalation as represented in the registration statement, Lineage was in fact suffering from stagnant or falling revenue, occupancy rates, and rent prices; and (5) consequently, Lineage's financial results, business operations, and prospects were materially impaired. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

NEW YORK,Sept. 13, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Fiserv, Inc. (""Fiserv"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:FI) and reminds investors of theSeptember 22, 2025deadlineto seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices inNew York,Pennsylvania,CaliforniaandGeorgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. Seewww.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaintallegesthat the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) due to cost issues and other problems with its older Payeezy platform, Fiserv forced Payeezy merchants to migrate to its Clover platform; (b) Clover's revenue growth and gross payment volume (""GPV""), the total monetary value of transactions processed through Clover, were temporarily and unsustainably boosted by these forced conversions, which concealed a slowdown in new merchant business; (c) shortly after these conversions, a significant portion of former Payeezy merchants switched to competing solutions due to Clover's high pricing, significant down time, and systematic compatibility issues; (d) as a result of these merchant losses, Clover's GPV growth was significantly slowing, and its revenue growth was unsustainable; and (e) based on the foregoing, Fiserv's positive Class Period statements about Clover's growth strategies, competition, attrition, GPV growth, and business prospects were materially false and misleading.

The market began to learn the truth about Defendants'fraudonApril 24, 2025. On that date, Fiserv shocked investors by reporting Clover GPV growth of only 8 percent for the first quarter of 2025, a material stepdown from 2024 GPV rates of between 14 and 17 percent. The Company attributed this slowing growth to lower 2025 transaction volumes from Payeezy merchants who had converted to Clover. On this news, Fiserv stock dropped 18.5 percent, closing at$176.90per share onApril 24, 2025. Then, onMay 15, 2025, Fiserv disappointed investors by disclosing that GPV growth deceleration would continue throughout 2025. On this news, Fiserv stock dropped 16.2 percent, closing at$159.13per share onMay 15, 2025. Finally, onJuly 23, 2025, Fiserv lowered the top end of its full-year organic growth guidance range and confirmed that its quarterly organic revenue in the Merchant segment had decelerated to 9 percent year-over-year from 11 percent in the previous quarter. On this news, Fiserv stock dropped 13.9 percent, closing at$143.00per share onJuly 23, 2025.

OnJuly 25, 2025, Charter issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2025 financial results.  The Company reported EBITDA of$5.7 billion, which suggested 0.5% growth year-over-year.  However, analysts and investors quickly realized that the so-called growth was on account of a$45 millionone-time benefit to ""other revenue.""  Had this event been excluded, EBITDA would have missed consensus estimates by 2.4% and shown a second quarter decline of 0.3% year-over-year.  At the same time, Charter reported that total Internet customers decreased by 117,000 for the second quarter of 2025.  The decline of Internet customers was nearly double from the 66,000 reported in the prior quarter.  Internet customer declines had also increased year-over-year when compared to a loss of 99,000 customers reported in the second quarter of 2024.

As detailed below, the complaintallegesthat the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (i) CTO's dividends were less sustainable than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) the Company used deceptive and unsustainable practices to artificially inflate its AFFO and overstate the true profitability of its Ashford Lane property; (iii) accordingly, CTO's business and/or financial prospects were overstated; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

OnJune 25, 2025, Wolfpack Research (""Wolfpack"") published a report entitled ""CTO: The B. Riley of REITs"" (the ""Wolfpack Report"" or the ""Report""), which compared CTO unfavorably to B. Riley, a financial services company that recently lost more than 90% of its value amid three years of losses, soured investments, delayed financial reports and revelations that the SEC had been investigating whether the firm gave shareholders an accurate picture of its health. Citing interviews with former employees and whistleblowers, the Wolfpack Report accused CTO of, among other things, ""not generat[ing] enough cash to pay its recurring capex and cover its dividends since converting to a REIT in 2021"" and instead ""rel[ying] on dilution (increasing shares outstanding by 70% sinceDecember 2022) to cover a$38 milliondividend shortfall from 2021 to 2024,"" employing a ""manipulative definition of [AFFO] where they exclude recurring capex, unlike all of their self-identified shopping center REIT peers,"" and ""us[ing] a sham loan to hide the collapse of a top tenant from shareholders at Ashford Lane."" (Emphasis in original). Further, Wolfpack predicted imminent further dilution of the Company, noting that CTO has just$8.4 millionin cash while facing quarterly dividends of$14 millionand average recurring capital expenditures of$5.7 millionper quarter, along with approximately$12 millionin additional planned capital expenditures.

According to the complaint, onJune 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase2bMASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase2bMASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial.

Following this news, the price of Altimmune's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of$7.71per share onJune 25, 2025, Altimmune's stock price fell to$3.61per share onJune 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day.

Nutex is a physician-led, healthcare services and operations company that began publicly trading via a reverse merger in April 2022.  The Company operates through three divisions: a hospital division comprised of 24 hospital facilities in 11 states, a population health management division, and real estate.  Nutex generally operates as an out-of-‎network provider and generates revenue, in part, from contracts with patients and, in most cases, a third-party payor such as commercial insurance, workers compensation insurance or, in limited cases, Medicare or Medicaid.  According to Nutex, on average, greater than 90% of its net patient service revenue is paid by third-party payors.

Prior to 2022, if a patient with health insurance received care from an out-of-network provider, even unknowingly, the patient's health plan might not have covered the entire out-of-network cost, leaving the patient with higher costs than if the care had come from an in-network provider.  In addition to any out-of-network cost sharing the patient might have owed, the out-of-network provider could bill the patient for the difference between the billed charge and the amount the patient's health plan paid, unless banned by state law—a practice called ""balance billing"".  An unexpected balance bill from an out-of-network provider is frequently referred to as a ""surprise bill"".

InDecember 2020, to curb surprise out-of-network billing, Congress enacted the No Surprises Act (""NSA"").  The NSA, which took effectJanuary 1, 2022, requires private health plans to cover out-of-network claims and apply in-network cost sharing, and prohibits doctors, hospitals, and other covered providers from billing patients more than the in-network cost sharing amount for surprise medical bills.  In addition, the NSA established an independent dispute resolution (""IDR"") process to determine out-of-network payment amounts between health plans and providers when open negotiations fail to result in an agreed-upon payment amount.

In the IDR process, the provider and health plan each submit a proposed payment amount and ‎‎additional information supporting their payment offers to an arbitrator, a certified IDR entity.  The arbitrator must select one of the two proposed payment amounts, taking into ‎account the ‎‎""qualifying payment amount"" (""QPA"")—the median contract rate for like specialties in the same geographical market—and additional circumstances including, among other things, the level of training, outcomes ‎‎measurements of the facility, the acuity of the individual treated, and the case mix and scope of services of the ‎facility ‎providing the service.

Initially, as an out-of-network provider, Nutex's business suffered after the NSA went into effect.  Specifically, because cost sharing under the statute is generally based on the median in-network rate a health plan pays for a service, the NSA prevented Nutex from charging patients higher prices for its services through out-of-network billing.  Indeed, inMarch 2023, Nutex reported that ""[s]ince the NSA became effective [. . .] our average payment by insurers of patient claims for emergency services has declined by approximately 30% including as much as a 37% reduction for physician services.""  The Company stated that, ""[i]n our experience, insurers often initially pay amounts lower than the QPA without regard for other information relevant to the claim. This requires us to make appeals using the IDR process.""",1,,,,,,,

Savara is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases.  The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as ""molgramostim""), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.  MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (""aPAP""), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs.  Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported ""track record of strong fiscal discipline,"" the Company is ""sufficiently capitalized"" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.

InDecember 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (""BLA"")—i.e., a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines—tothe United States(""U.S."") Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the ""MOLBREEVI BLA"").  In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, ""[g]iven the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,"" and that ""[i]nitiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. andEurope.""  Moreover, Savara represented that it ""expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.""

To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (""CMC"").  Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process—including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation—and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.

The Complaintallegesthat, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

OnMay 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release ""announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].""  Specifically, Savara revealed that ""[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).""",1,,,,,,,

OnJune 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase2bMASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While Altimmune had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase2bMASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, the Company answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial.

Flywire, together with its subsidiaries, operates as a payments-enablement and software company inthe United States(""U.S."") and internationally.  The Company's payment platform and network, as well as its vertical-specific software, purportedly facilitate payments between clients and customers in a variety of industries.

Although Flywire has a wide range of clients across various verticals—i.e., markets encompassing a group of companies and customers that are all interconnected around a specific niche—its largest vertical is education, the volumes and revenue from which rely on international enrollments and student school preferences.  Accordingly, Flywire's business in the education industry is of particular importance to investors and analysts, especially the Company's Americas market, consisting of the U.S. andCanada, as well as itsAsiaand Pacific region market, including Australia.  To assess its financial performance in these markets, Flywire utilizes a number of non-GAAP  financial measures important to investors, including,inter alia, revenue less ancillary services (""RLAS"") and foreign exchange (""FX"") neutral RLAS.

InJanuary 2024, the Canadian government began announcing intake caps on international student permit applications, thereby reportedly reducing the number of international students coming to Canada.  This, in turn, resulted in a corresponding reduction in payment flows and an adverse effect on Flywire's business.  Likewise, since late 2023, the Australian government has tightened international student visa rules through various measures, which have likewise had an adverse impact on the Company's business.

Notwithstanding the foregoing permit- and visa-related headwinds, at all relevant times, Defendants consistently touted the sustainability of Flywire's revenue growth and financial condition, while downplaying the anticipated negative impacts of permit- and visa-related headwinds on the Company's business.  For example, as late asNovember 2024, Defendants represented, among other things, that Flywire was and would remain a purported ""Rule of 40""  company with strong revenue growth, while indicating that, for full year (""FY"") 2025, FX neutral RLAS growth year-over-year (""Y/Y"") was expected to be in the low 20% range, that revenue growth inCanadawould be relatively flat compared to 2024, and that Defendants observed merely an early moderation in the revenue growth rate inAustralia.

The complaintallegesthat, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the strength and sustainability of Flywire's revenue growth was overstated; (ii) the negative impact that permit- and visa-related restrictions were having and were likely to have on Flywire's business was understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.",1,,,,,,,

CTO is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (""REIT"") that owns and operates a portfolio of purported high-quality, retail-based properties located primarily in higher growth markets inthe United States(""U.S."").  The Company converted into a REIT inFebruary 2021and, as ofDecember 31, 2024, owned 23 income properties in seven states, including Ashford Lane, a retail and dining center inAtlanta, Georgia.

Under guidelines established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), REITs must pay out at least 90% of their taxable profits to shareholders annually as dividends.  In return, REIT companies are exempt from most corporate income tax.  CTO has touted that its operation as a REIT ""provides the tax-efficient organizational structure for [its] stockholders"" that ""will allow [it] to provide them with an attractive and sustainable dividend.""

To measure its performance, CTO uses the financial metric Adjusted Funds from Operations (""AFFO"").  The AFFO of a REIT, though subject to varying methods of computation, is generally equal to the REIT's funds from operations with adjustments made for recurring capital expenditures (also referred to as ""capex"") used to maintain the quality of the REIT's underlying assets.  Professional analysts tend to prefer AFFO because it takes into consideration additional costs incurred by the REIT as well as additional income sources, such as rent increases.  Thus, analysts believe that AFFO provides for a more accurate base number when estimating present values and a better predictor of the REIT's future ability to pay dividends.

The Complaintallegesthat, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CTO's dividends were less sustainable than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) the Company used deceptive and unsustainable practices to artificially inflate its AFFO and overstate the true profitability of its Ashford Lane property; (iii) accordingly, CTO's business and/or financial prospects were overstated; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

OnJune 25, 2025, Wolfpack Research (""Wolfpack"") published a report entitled ""CTO: The B. Riley of REITs"" (the ""Wolfpack Report"" or the ""Report""), which compared CTO unfavorably to B. Riley, a financial services company that recently lost more than 90% of its value amid three years of losses, soured investments, delayed financial reports and revelations that the SEC had been investigating whether the firm gave shareholders an accurate picture of its health.  Citing interviews with former employees and whistleblowers, the Wolfpack Report accused CTO of, among other things, ""not generat[ing] enough cash to pay its recurring capex and cover its dividends since converting to a REIT in 2021"" and instead ""rel[ying] on dilution (increasing shares outstanding by 70% sinceDecember 2022) to cover a$38 milliondividend shortfall from 2021 to 2024,"" employing a ""manipulative definition of [AFFO] where they exclude recurring capex, unlikeallof their self-identified shopping center REIT peers,"" and ""us[ing] a sham loan to hide the collapse of a top tenant from shareholders at Ashford Lane.""  (Emphasis in original).  Further, Wolfpack predicted imminent further dilution of the Company, noting that CTO has just$8.4 millionin cash while facing quarterly dividends of$14 millionand average recurring capital expenditures of$5.7 millionper quarter, along with approximately$12 millionin additional planned capital expenditures.",1,,,,,,,

Dow is an American materials science company, serving customers in the packaging, infrastructure, mobility, and consumer applications industries.  Dow conducts its worldwide operations through six global businesses organized into three operating segments: (i) Packaging & Specialty Plastics, (ii) Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, and (iii) Performance Materials & Coatings.

Historically, Dow has touted its ""industry-leading dividend,"" which is of particular importance to investors.  On conference calls with investors and analysts, Dow's Chief Executive Officer, DefendantJim Fitterling(""Fitterling""), has variously stated that the Company's ""dividend is a key element of our investment thesis,"" and that ""north of 65% of our owners count on that dividend.""

Notwithstanding an ongoing slump in the materials science industry, as well as the recent onset of tariff-related market uncertainties, at all relevant times, Defendants represented that Dow was well positioned to weather macroeconomic and tariff-related headwinds while maintaining sufficient levels of financial flexibility to support the Company's lucrative dividend.  Specifically, Defendants cited various purported strengths and advantages unique to Dow in its industry, including,inter alia, the Company's purported ""differentiated portfolio,"" ""cost-advantaged footprint,"" and ""industry-leading flexibility to navigate global trade dynamics.""

Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Dow's business, operations, and prospects.  Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Dow's ability to mitigate macroeconomic and tariff-related headwinds, as well as to maintain the financial flexibility needed to support its lucrative dividend, was overstated; (ii) the true scope and severity of the foregoing headwinds' negative impacts on Dow's business and financial condition was understated, particularly with respect to competitive and pricing pressures, softening global sales and demand for the Company's products, and an oversupply of products in the Company's global markets; and (iii) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

OnJune 23, 2025, BMO Capital downgraded its recommendation on Dow to ""Underperform"" from ""Market Perform"" while also cutting its price target on the Company's stock to$22.00per share from$29.00per share, citing sustained weakness across key end markets and mounting pressure on the Company's dividend.",1,,,,,,,

Specifically, Six Flags reduced its EBITDA guidance to between$860 millionand$910 millionfor the year, down from a previous expectation of between$1.08 billionand$1.12 billion.

Six Flags also noted that concern over fewer season-pass holders continues to be a headwind on demand, which may be an overhang for the Company until later in the year as the 2026 season-pass program ramps up. In addition, Six Flags stated that its president and Chief Executive Officer,Richard Zimmerman, plans to step down from these roles by the end of the year.
